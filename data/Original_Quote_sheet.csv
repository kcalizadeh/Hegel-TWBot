,Logic did not fare quite so badly as metaphysics
,Even the proofs of the existence of God are cited only for historical interest or for purposes of edification and uplifting the emotions
,The fact is that there no longer exists any interest either in the form or the content of metaphysics or in both together
,[Kantian philosophy] was a justification from a philosophical quarter for the renunciation of speculative thought
,there was seen the strange spectacle of a cultured nation without metaphysics−like a temple richly ornamented but without a holy of holies.
,"outer existence seemed to be transformed into the bright world of flowers−and there are no black flowers, as we know"
,the spirit of practicality certainly did not intend for logic a better fate than was suffered by the sister science
,That one learns from logic how to think − just as if one could only learn how to digest and move about by studying anatomy and physiology
,logic shows no traces so far of the new spirit
,"once the form of the spirit has inwardly reconstituted itself, all attempts to preserve the forms of an earlier culture are utterly in vain"
,like withered leaves they are pushed off by the new buds already growing at their roots
,the only way they can give a positive significance and a content to their negative attitude is to fall in with the new ways of thinking
,the period of fermentation with which a new creative idea begins is past
,it is fearful of losing itself in the ramifications of the particular
,"it shuns the labour required for a scientific elaboration of the new principle and in its need for such, it grasps at an empty formalism"
,The challenge to elaborate and systematise the material now becomes all the more pressing
,the higher demand is that it should become systematised knowledge
,"the science of logic which constitutes metaphysics proper or purely speculative philosophy, has hitherto still been much neglected"
,what is involved is an altogether new concept of scientific procedure
,"Philosophy, if it would be a science, cannot, as I have remarked elsewhere, borrow its method from subordinate sciences like mathematics"
,"[Philosophy cannot] remain satisfied with categorical assurances of inner intuition, or employ arguments based on external reflection"
,it can be only the nature of the content itself which spontaneously develops itself in a scientific method of knowing
,since it is at the same time the reflection of the content itself which first posits and generates its determinate character
,"The understanding determines, and holds the determinations fixed"
,"reason is negative and dialectical, because it resolves the determinations of the understanding into nothing"
,[reason] is positive because it generates the universal and comprehends the particular therein
,Just as the understanding is usually taken to be something separate from reason as such
,so too dialectical reason is usually taken to be something distinct from positive reason
,"But reason in its truth is spirit which is higher than either merely positive reason, or merely intuitive understanding"
,"It is the negative, that which constitutes the quality alike of dialectical reason and of understanding"
,"it negates what is simple, thus positing the specific difference of the understanding; it equally resolves it and is thus dialectical"
,But it does not stay in the nothing of this result but in the result is no less positive - in this way it has restored what was simple
,but as a universal which is within itself concrete
,a given particular is not subsumed under this universal 
,"but in this determining, this positing of a difference, and the resolving of it, the particular has already determined itself"
,this movement is the absolute method of knowing and at the same time is the immanent soul of the content itself
,"I maintain that it is this self−construing method alone which enables philosophy to be an objective, demonstrated science"
,Consciousness is spirit as a concrete knowing
,but the development of this object rests solely on the nature of the pure essentialities which constitute the content of logic
,"but the development of this object, like the development of all natural and spiritual life,"
,"Consciousness, as spirit in its manifestation which in its progress frees itself from its immediacy and external concretion"
,"They are pure thoughts, spirit thinking its own essential nature"
,Their self−movement is their spiritual life and is that through which philosophy constitutes itself and of which it is the exposition
,"To exhibit the realm of thought philosophically, that is, in its own immanent activity or what is the same, in its necessary development"
,"The forms of thought are, in the first instance, displayed and stored as human language"
,Nowadays we cannot be too often reminded that it is thinking which distinguishes man from the beasts
,"everything that he expresses in language contains a category−concealed, mixed with other forms or clearly determined as such, "
,"so much is Logic his natural element, indeed his own peculiar nature"
, logic must certainly be said to be the supernatural element which permeates every relationship of man to nature
,"If nature as such, as the physical, is contrasted with the spiritual sphere, then logic must certainly be said to be th supernatural element"
,It is an advantage when a language possesses an abundance of logical expressions
,many prepositions and articles denote relationships based on thought
,It is important that in language the categories should appear in the form of substantives and verbs and thus take on the form of objectivity
,to find the union of opposites naively shown in the dictionary as one word with opposite meanings
,this result of speculative thinking is nonsensical to the understanding
,Philosophy therefore stands in no need of a special terminology
,"The advance of culture generally, and of the sciences in particular, gradually brings into use higher relationships of thought"
,"the empirical and natural sciences, which in general employ the commonest categories: whole and parts, a thing and its properties, and such"
,"In physics, for example, the category of force has become predominant"
," the form of abstraction, of identity, by which a specific concept, as, for example, force, acquires an independent self−subsistence"
,the category of polarity which is the determination of a difference in which the different terms are inseparably conjoined
,"prominence has been given to the determinate form, the difference, which is at the same time an inseparable element in the identity"
,Because of the fixed reality of natural objects the study of nature compels us to fix the categories  which can no longer be ignored in her
,indulging in generalities as so easily happens in the intellectual sphere.
,"[logic] may be thoroughly familiar to educated people it does not follow, as I have said, that they are intelligently apprehended"
,"just those determinations of thought which we employ on every occasion, which pass our lips in every sentence we speak"
,to have to occupy oneself with what is familiar can even arouse impatience
,the kind of preliminary general idea which is demanded in the case of any science prior to its exposition
,there is no human desiring or willing without ideation
,the forms of thought have been freed from the material in which they are submerged
,these universalities have been brought into prominence for their own sake and made objects of contemplation
,"As a matter of fact, the need to occupy oneself with pure thought presupposes that the human spirit must already have travelled a long road"
,"In the silent regions of thought which has come to itself and communes only with itself,"
,the interests which move the lives of races and individuals are hushed
,"In the silent regions of thought which has come to itself, ... the interests which move the lives of races and individuals are hushed"
,"this science, which is not studied for its utility, is the only absolutely free science and so seems to be a more than human possession"
,logic is concerned only and solely with these thoughts as thoughts
,"For this reason it is customary, to include logic in the curriculum of youth"
, the study of logic is a preliminary labour to be carried out in school and it is not until later that the serious business of life begins 
,"In life, the categories are used;"
,"in the conception of God or of love there is epitomised in the simplicity of such ideating an infinite host of ideas actions states, etc!"
,"Secondly, the categories serve for the more exact determination and discovery of objective relations"
,"when in philo. reflection the categories are made to serve as means, then thinking is treated as subordinate to the other activities of mind"
,"We do not indeed say of our feelings, impulses or interests that they serve us"
,"rather do they count as independent forces and powers, so that to have this particular feeling, to desire this, is what we are"
,"But probably we are more conscious of obeying our feelings passions, interests, not to mention habits, than of having them in our possession"
,"still less, in view of our intimate union with them, of their being at our disposal"
,universality which we are conscious ourselves of being
,we are disposed to regard ourselves as caught up in these particular states and dominated by them
,it is much more difficult to believe that the forms of thought which permeate all our ideas are tools for us rather than that we serve them
,"When we give ourselves up to a sensation, a purpose, an interest, and in it feel ourselves confined and unfree,"
,"the place into which we can withdraw ourselves back into freedom is this region of self−certainty, of pure abstraction, of thought"
,"we call the nature or the essence of things their notion, and this is only for thought;"
,still less shall we say of the notions of things that we dominate them
," on the contrary, it is our thinking that must accommodate itself to them and our freedom ought not to want to mold them to suit itself"
,"subjective thought is our very own, innermost, act"
,the objective notion of things constitutes their essential import
,"we cannot go outside this our act, we cannot stand above it, and just as little can we go beyond the nature of things"
,for us the object can be nothing else but our notions of it
,it is absurd to say that the object would be set up as criterion for our notion while for us the object can be nothing but our notion of it
," these very things which are supposed to stand beyond us, and  beyond the thoughts referring to them, are  figments of subjective thought"
,the so−called thing−in−itself of empty abstraction.
,"what we consciously attend to is the contents, the objects of our ideas, that in which we are interested"
,"what is genuinely permanent & substantial in the complexity & contingency of appearance & fleeting manifestation, is the notion of the thing"
,each individual animal is such individual primarily because it is an animal:
,"if this is true, then it would be impossible to say what such an individual could still be if this foundation were removed"
,"the profounder basis is the soul itself, the pure Notion which is the very heart of things, the simple life−pulse, even of thinking of them"
,"To focus attention on this logical nature which animates mind, moves and works in it, this is the task"
,the content of the interest in which one is absorbed is drawn out of immediate unity with oneself & becomes an independent object of thought
,"whereas when thinking is an instinctive activity, spirit is encaged in its categories and is broken up into an infinitely varied material"
,The most important point for the nature of spirit is ... the relation of what it knows itself to be to what it actually is
,"because spirit is essentially consciousness, this self−knowing is a fundamental determination of its actuality"
,As impulses the categories are only instinctively active.
,At first they enter consciousness separately and so are variable and mutually confusing;
,"the determinations of thought, primarily as forms which are distinct from the matter of thought and only attached to it"
,the loftier business of logic therefore is to clarify these categories and in them to raise mind to freedom and truth
,"In whatever respect the true may be associated with limitation and finitude this is the aspect of its negation, of its untruth and unreality"
,it is in bondage to unclarified and therefore unfree thinking
,"generally speaking they concern only the correctness of the knowledge of facts, not truth itself."
,including in our conception of thought not only that which is usually reckoned as belonging to the external form but the content as well. 
,"what at first to ordinary reflection is, as content, divorced from form, cannot in fact be formless, cannot be devoid of inner determination"
,the content in its own self possesses form
,it is form itself which is transformed only into the semblance of a content
,"it is form itself which is transformed into only the semblance of a content, hence into a semblance of something external to this semblance"
,"the subject matter is not things but their import, the Notion of them"
,"secondly, a Notion is determinate and it is this determinateness in it which appears as content"
,"in any case, any demand for a systematic disposal of such random reflections could only be partially satisfied"
,"A plastic discourse demands, too, a plastic receptivity and understanding on the part of the listener;"
,the uncouth and uneducated behaviour of taking a category which is under consideration for something other than the category itself
,"Thoroughness seems to require that the beginning, as the foundation on which everything is built, should be examined before anything else,"
,"it has before it, enclosed in this germ, the entire development"
,this education and discipline of thinking by which it acquires plasticity and by which the impatience of casual reflection is overcome
,"In no science is the need to begin with the subject itself, without preliminary reflections, felt more strongly than in the science of logic"
,these abstract matters have ceased to be flesh - Hegel
,If we go on to cast a look at the fate of world historical personalities… we shall find it to have been no happy one
,When their object is attained they fall off like empty hulls from the kernel
,"The state of one’s mind ie the phase of mind which one so far possesses, conforms precisely to the state of the world as one so far views it"
,History is not the soil of happiness. The periods of happiness are blank pages in it.
,in this educational progress we can see the history of the world’s culture delineated in faint outline
,To make abstractions hold in reality is to destroy reality - Hegel
,Life is essentially the concept which realizes itself only through self-division and reunification
,A building is not finished when its foundation is laid - Hegel
,The plant brings forth its light as its own self in the blossom. - Hegel
, Free speech is assured by the innocuous character which it acquires as a result of the stability of government - Hegel
,To be independent of public opinion is the first formal condition of achieving anything great or rational - Hegel
,"Public opinion has common sense, but is infected by accidents of opinion, ignorance and perversity - Hegel"
,Necessity appears to itself in the shape of freedom - Hegel
,it is the art of music which conducts us to the final summit of that ascent to freedom - Hegel
,"The tool lasts, while the immediate enjoyments pass away and are forgotten."
,No act of revenge is justified. - Hegel
,"By the act of reflection something is altered in the way in which the fact was originally presented in sensation, perception, or conception"
,the man who wonders at nothing lives in a state of imbecility and stupidity.
,"The fact is, no man can think for another, any more than he can eat or drink for him"
,Existence as determinate being is in essence being for another.
,"Amid the pressure of great events, a general principle gives no help. - Hegel"
,"To him who looks upon the world rationally, the world in its turn presents a rational aspect. The relation is mutual. - Hegel"
,"you cannot save people, only love them - Anaïs Nin"
,World history is a court of judgment - Hegel
,Hell is truth seen too late - Hobbes
,"A hand e.g. when hewn off from the body is, as Aristotle has observed, a hand in name only, not in fact - Hegel"
,Reason is as cunning as it is powerful
,"Logic on the contrary, cannot presuppose any of these forms of reflection and laws of thinking, for these constitute part of its own content"
,"what logic is cannot be stated beforehand, rather this knowledge of what it is first emergea as the final outcome of the whole exposition"
,the Notion of logic has its genesis in the course of exposition and cannot therefore be premised
,"But in the first place, it is quite inept to say that logic abstracts from all content"
,"as thinking and the rules of thinking are supposed to be the subject matter of logic, these directly constitute its peculiar content;"
,"Hitherto, the Notion of logic has rested on the separation, ... of the content of cognition and its form, or of truth and certainty"
,"the object is regarded as something complete on its own account, something which can wholly dispense with thought for its actuality"
,it based itself on the fact that the knowledge of things obtained through thinking is alone what is really true in them
,"Thus this metaphysic believed that thinking (and its determinations) is not anything alien to the object, but rather is its essential nature"
,"In this self−renunciation on the part of reason, the Notion of truth is lost;"
,the insight into the necessary conflict of the determinations of the understanding with themselves.
,But equally it must transcend these its separating determinations and straightway connect them
,It is at the stage of this connecting of the determinations that their conflict emerges.
,This connecting activity of reflection belongs in itself to reason
,"the rising above determinations, which attains an insight into their conflict, is the great negativestep towards the true Notion of reason"
,"the insight, when not thorough−going, commits the mistake of thinking that it is reason which is in contradiction with itself;"
,it does not recognise that the contradiction is precisely the rising of reason above the limits of the understanding & the resolving of them
,"[Kant] attributes to us a correct perception, with the rider that nevertheless we cannot percieve what is true but only what is false"
,determinations of finite & infinite conflict in the same way whether they are applied to to the world or are determinations within the mind
,"Absurd as this would be, it would not be more so than a true knowledge which did not know the object as it is in itself."
,the forms of objective thinking are removed by this critique only from the thing; they are left in the subject just as they were originally
,this abstract shadow divorced from all content - Hegel
,"But this attempt, because it proceeded from a subjective standpoint, could not be brought to a successful conclusion"
,the insubstantial nature of logical forms originates solely in the way in which they are considered and dealt with
,The content which is missing in the logical forms is nothing else than a solid foundation and a concretion of these abstract determinations;
,if logic is supposed to lack a substantial content the fault is not with its subject matter but with the way in which this matter is grasped
," [logic] cannot be justified in any other way than by this emergence in consciousness, all the forms of which are resolved into this Notion"
,a definition of science−or more precisely of logic−has its proof solely in the already mentioned necessity of its emergence in consciousness
,"argumentation is open to the most manifold and various opinions, on which a decision can finally be determined only arbitrarily"
,it is only in absolute knowing that separation of the object from the certainty of itself is completely eliminated
,Thus pure science presupposes liberation from the opposition of consciousness.
,"logic is to be understood as the system of pure reason, as the realm of pure thought"
,one must discard the prejudice that truth must be something tangible.
,only in its Notion does a thing possess actuality; to the extent that it is distinct from its Notion it ceases to be actual & is a nonentity
, Now if logic has not undergone any change since Aristotle ... then surely ... it is all the more in need of a total reconstruction; 
,"The addition of psychological, pedagogic & physiological material which logic received in the past has now been recognised as disfigurement"
,the method is the consciousness of the form of the inner self−movement of the content of logic
,the negative is just as much positive - Hegel
,"what is self−contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, ... but essentially only into the negation of its particular content"
,the result essentially contains that from which it results;
,"Because the result, the negation, is a specific negation, it has content"
,"[the result of negation] is richer by the negation or opposite of its predecessor, therefore contains it, but also something more"
,the method which I follow in this system of logic −− or rather which this system in its own self follows −−
,That which enables the Notion to advance itself is the already mentioned negative which it possesses within itself
,"if no advance is made beyond the abstract negative aspect of dialectic, the result is only that reason is incapable of knowing the infinite"
,it is only after profounder acquaintance with the other sciences that logic ceases to be for subjective spirit a merely abstract universal
,the value of logic is only apprehended when it is preceded by experience of the sciences - Hegel
,"The system of logic is the realm of shadows, the world of simple essentialities freed from all sensuous concreteness"
,"In the philosophical treatment of classification, the Notion itself must show that it is itself the course of those determinations. "
,"in [logic] the opposition in consciousness between a subject, and a second an object, is known to be overcome; "
,"because they are at the same time known as distinct (yet not with an independent being), their unity is not abstract and inert, but concrete"
,"we must not understand the judgment as a resolving of a concrete unity back into its determinations, as if these had independent subsistence"
,it is easy to perceive that such an abstraction as the thing−in−itself is itself only a product of thought
,"an object is a thought, and to determine it means partly, first to produce it, and partly, to have further thoughts about it"
,it is first and immediately ontology whose place is taken by objective logic
,The subjective logic is the logic of the ... the subject itself
,"What philosophy begins with must be either mediated or immediate, & it can be neither one nor the other; either way of beginning is refuted"
,In this science of manifested spirit the beginning is made from empirical consciousness - this is immediate knowledge in the strict sense
,"Logic is pure science, that is, pure knowledge in the entire range of its development"
,"Thus the principle ought also to be the beginning, and what is the first for thought ought also to be the first in the process of thinking."
,"there is nothing, nothing in heaven, or in nature or in mind or anywhere else which does not equally contain both immediacy and mediation"
,[mediation and immediacy] reveal themselves to be unseparated and inseparable and the opposition between them to be a nullity
,all that is needed to ensure that the beginning remains immanent in its scientific development is simply to take up what is there before us.
,"pure knowing is without any distinction & as thus distinctionless, ceases itself to be knowledge; what is present is only simple immediacy"
,"This simple immediacy, therefore, in its true expression is pure being"
,"if no presupposition is made & the beginning itself is taken immediately, then its only determination is that it is the beginning of logic"
,absolute truth must be a result
,Thus consciousness on its onward path from the immediacy with which it began is led back to absolute knowledge as its innermost truth
,the whole of the science of logic must be within itself a circle in which the first is also the last and the last is also the first. 
,"absolute spirit at the end of the development is known as freely externalising itself, abandoning itself to the shape of an immediate being "
,"on the other hand, it is equally necessary to consider as result that into which the movement returns as into its ground"
,the progress from that which forms the beginning is to be regarded as only a further determination of it
,that which forms the starting point of the development remains at the base of all that follows and does not vanish from it.
,"This pure being is the unity into which pure knowing withdraws,"
,"here at the start, where the subject matter itself is not yet to hand, philosophy is an empty word or some assumed, unjustified conception"
,"pure being is to be considered as the unity into which knowing has collapsed at the extreme point of its union with the object,"
,"in the beginning, being and nothing are present as distinguished from each other;"
,"that which begins already is, but equally, too, is not as yet."
,"that which constitutes the beginning, the beginning itself, is to be taken as something unanalysable, taken in its simple unfilled immediacy"
,"absolute truth must be a result, and a result presupposes a prior truth"
,"absolute spirit reveals itself as freely externalising itself, abandoning itself to the shape of an immediate being"
,it is equally necessary to consider as result that into which the movement returns as into its ground.
,"The beginning of philosophy is present & preserved throughout the development, remaining completely immanent in its further determinations"
,"because that which forms the beginning is still undeveloped, devoid of content, it is not truly known in the beginning;"
,it lies in the very nature of a beginning that it must be being and nothing else.
,"where the subject matter itself is not yet to hand, philosophy is an empty word or some assumed, unjustified conception"
,"that which begins already is, but equally, too, is not as yet."
,"The opposites being and nonbeing are therefore directly united in the beginning, or, otherwise expressed, it is their undifferentiated unity"
,"In this sense, the abstract concept would be the first definition of the absolute & all further determinations only richer definitions of it"
,"the beginning cannot be made with anything concrete, anything containing a relation within itself"
,"that which constitutes the beginning, the beginning itself, must be taken as something unanalysable, taken in its simple unfilled immediacy"
,But the ego as such is at the same time the most concrete of all things −− the consciousness of itself as an infinitely manifold world. 
,the pure knowing which has in truth overcome the opposition of consciousness.
,"if something concrete is taken as the beginning, the conjunction of the determinations contained in it demand proof, and this is lacking."
,for only in what is simple is there nothing more than the pure beginning;
,Pedantry is thus an affected thoroughness. - Kant
,"practical importance cannot be foreseen, one must simply wait and watch for it - Kant"
,Civilization has raised this latest era so far above the ancient antithesis of Reason and faith
,"the positive element with which Reason busied itself to do battle, is no longer religion, and victorious Reason is no longer Reason. "
,when thought is an instinctive activity the spirit is caught up in the web of its categories and is splintered into an infinite variety
,here and there on this web there are knots which give stability and direction to the life and consciousness of spirit
,"because spirit is essentially consciousness, this self-knowledge is a fundamental determination of its actuality"
,"By the little which now satisfies Spirit, we can measure the extent of its loss"
,Philosophy must beware of the wish to be edifying
,Spirit is indeed never at rest but always engaged in moving forward
,"The gradual crumbling that left unaltered the face of the whole is cut short by a sunburst which, in one flash, illuminates the new world"
,The Truth is the whole. But the whole is nothing other than the essence consummating itself through its development
,"If the refutation is thorough, it is developed from the principle itself, not by counter-assertions & random thoughts from the outside"
,Truth is not a minted coin that can be given and pocketed ready-made
,The True is thus the Bacchanalian revel in which no member is not drunk
,Being is only as the movement of nothingness to nothingness
,"Reflection, as absolute reflection, is essence shining within"
,the hour of their birth is the hour of their death
,contradiction is the root of all movement and life
,"something is alive, therefore, only to the extent that it contains contradiction within itself"
,"if a contradiction can be pointed out in something, by itself this is still not, as it were, a blemish, not a defect or failure"
,"mind, therefore, sets out only from its own being and is in relationship only with its own determinations"
,"mind itself is this elevation above nature and natural determinacy, and above the involvement with an external object, i.e. above the material element in general"
,"mind is thus the absolutely universal certainty of itself, free of any opposition whatever"
,"free mind stands, like consciousness, as one side confronting the object, and is at the same time both sides and therefore, like the soul, a totality"
,consciousness is finite insofar as it has an object
,the soul is finite insofar as it is determined immediately or by nature
,"it belongs to the concept of mind that within it the absolute unity of the subjective and objective be not merely in itself, but also for itself, and therefore object of knowledge"
,"the free mind is essentially active, productive"
,"it is not philosophy's business to take such untruths of contingent reality and of representation for the truth, to take what is bad for the nature of the matter"
,"cognition is genuine just insofar as the intelligence actualizes it, i.e. posits the concept of cognition for itself"
,"a feeling, however pure and true its content may be, has the form of contingent particularity"
,"if a man on any topic appeals not to the nature and concept of the subject-matter ... but to his feeling, the only thing to do is to let him alone, because he thereby spurns the community of rationality, withdraws into his isolated subjectivity, into particularity"
,"a genuine poet, before and during the execution of his work, must meditate and think contemplatively; only in this way can he hope to extricate the heart or the soul of the matter from all the externalities in which it is shrouded"
,"the image, which in the pit of intelligence was only its property, is now, with the determination of externality, also in its possession"
,"even the association of representations is to be conceived as subsumption of the individual representations under a universal representation, which forms the connection between them"
,"intelligence is the power over the stock of images and representations belonging to it, and thus freely combines and subsumes this stock under its own particular content"
,"in fantasy intelligence has been perfected to self-intuition within itself, inasmuch as its content, derived from its own self, has pictorial existence"
,"the intuition, which in its immediacy is initially something given and spatial, acquires, insofar as it is used as a sign, the essential determination of occurring only as sublated"
,"the name is thus the ting, as the thing is available and carries weight in the realm of representation"
,"the name, as existence of the content within the intelligence, is the externality of intell. itself within itself; and the recollection of the name as the intuition produced by intell. is at the same time the self-externalization in which intelligence posits itself inside itself"
,"we obviously do not really know a composition by heart, until we attach no sense to the words"
,the recitation of what is thus known by heart therefore automatically becomes accentless [because we attach no sense to the words]
,"intelligence knows that what is thought, is; and that what is, only is insofar as it is thought"
,"in intellectual thinking, the content is indifferent to its from, while in rational or conceptual cognition the content produces its form from its own self"
,"true freedom is ethical life, where the will has for its purposes a universal content, not subjective, i.e. self-centered, content"
,"such [universal content of ethics] is only possible in thinking and through thinking; it is nothing less than absurd to want to exclude thinking from ethics, religion, lawfulness, &tc"
,"what more there is in feeling than in rationality is only particular subjectivity, vanity, and wilfulness"
,"the rational, which in the shape of rationality is something thought, is the same content as the good practical feeling has, but in its universality and necessity, in its objectivity and truth"
,evil is nothing but the inadequacy of being to the ought
,"in regard to contingent purposes, evil is only the justice that is imposed on the vanity and nullity of their devising. they themselves are already what is evil"
,"passion is neither good nor evil; this form only expresses that a subject has placed the whole vital interest of its mind, talent, character, enjoyment in one content"
,"it only a dead, too often, indeed, a hypocritical morality which inveighs against the very form of passion"
,"the truth of particular satisfactions is the universal satisfaction, which the thinking will makes its purpose as happiness"
,"knowledge of mind is the most concrete knowledge, and thus the highest and most difficult"
,truth just means agreement of the concept with its actuality
,"for us mind has nature as its presupposition, though mind is the truth of nature, and is thus absolutely first with respect to it"
,mind is preceded not only by the lgical idea but also by external nature
,every determinacy is a determinacy only in contrast to another determinacy
,"in the living creature, of course, there emerges a higher necessity than that which holds sway in lifeless things"
,the essence of mind is freedom
,"only when i come to apprehend myself as I, does the other become an object for me, confront me, and at the same time get posited ideally in me, and hence brought back to unity with me"
,"consciousness as relationship involves only the categories belonging to the abstract I or to formal thinking; and these are, for it, determinations of the object"
,i grasp every object as a member in the system of what i myself am
,"in consciousness, we see the tremendous difference, on the one side, of the I, this wholly simple entity, and on the other side, of the infinite variety of the world"
,"the oppostion of the i and the world, which does not yet come to genuine mediation here, constitutes the finitude of consciousness"
,this immediacy has no truth; we must advance from it to the essential being of the object
,the non-living entity has no urges because it is incapable of enduring contradiction; it perishes when the Other of itself forces its way into it
,"the ensouled creature and the mind necessarily have urges, since neither the sould nor the mind can be, without having contradiction within themselves and either feeling it or being aware of it"
,the object is conformable to the desire and just for this reason desire is aroused by the object
,"although all alteration as such, which is posited by the activity of the subject, is the subject's deed, the subject does not for that reason recognize it as its action; it recognizes as its own only that reality in the deed which lay in its knowledge and will; ie its purpose"
,"happiness is distinguished from well-being only in this, that happiness is conceived just as an immediate reality, whereas well-being is regarded as justifiable in relation to morality"
,"to the subject, who in the reality of his freedom essentially becomes a particular, his interest and well-being ought, because of the reality of his freedom, to be an essential aim and therefore a duty"
,"the good is thus posited as a contingency for the subject, who can therefore resolve on something opposed to the good, can be evil"
