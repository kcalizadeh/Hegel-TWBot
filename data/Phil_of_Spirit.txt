HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF MIND

G. W. F. Hegel is an immensely important yet difficult philosopher. Philosophy
ofMind is the third part of Hegel's Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences,
in which he summarizes his philosophical system. It is one of the main pillars
of his thought. Michael Inwood presents this central work to the modern read­
er in an intelligible and accurate new translation-the first into English since
1894-that loses nothing of the style of Hegel's thought. In his editorial intro­
duction lnwood offers a philosophically sophisticated evaluation of Hegel's ideas
which includes a survey of the whole of Hegel's thought and detailed analysis of
the terminology he used. This translation is issued simultaneously with a com­
panion volume in which lnwood offers a full commentary on the work.
Michael Inwood is Fellow and Tutor in Philosophy at Trinity College, Oxford.

Editors Introduction
This book is concerned with Geist. Geist is both 'mind' and 'spirit'. It is the
'mind' of an individual. It is the 'spirit' of a people. It is art, religion, and philo­
sophy. It is the Holy Spirit. Geist is the dominant concept in Hegel's philosophy.
It propels his thought onward and upward. Geist itself, in Hegel's view, propels
humanity onward and upward. If there is any 'secret of Hegel', that secret is
Geist. l But what is Geist? Can it bear all the meanings Hegel assigns to it? Can
it perform the multitude of tasks that Hegel requires of it? Such are the questions
that this Introduction attempts to �swer.
H E G EL

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was born in Stuttgart in 1770. After leaving the
local high school, he enrolled in the philosophy faculty of Tiibingen university
in 1788, but later transferred to the theological faculty with the aim of becom­
ing a Lutheran pastor. On graduating in 1793, he followed the common practice
of serving as a private tutor to the children of a wealthy family, first in Berne
and later in Frankfurt. During this period he wrote some essays on Christianity,
which in general regret, and attempt to explain, its degeneration into a 'posit­
ive' religion, a religion of prescribed dogmas, rules, and rituals, in contrast to
the 'folk-religion' of ancient Greece that it supplanted. The most important of
these essays, 'The Spirit of Christianity and its Fate', argued that Jesus originally
preached a religion of love, but that it had to become a religion of law, a positive
religion, in order to convert mankind. Despite the occurrence of the word 'spirit'
( Geist) in its title, as yet spirit plays only a subordinate role in Hegel's thought.
He invests more hope in 'love' as a means of overcoming the alienating oppos­
itions-between simple faith and ecclesiastical authority, between reason and
the heart-that he so deplored. As yet, Hegel doubts the capacity of conceptual
thought to do justice to the insights ofChristianity.2
Early in 1801 Hegel moved to Jena to lecture at the university where his
younger, but more precocious friend Friedrich Schelling already held a profess­
orship. It was here that Geist, along with conceptual thought, secured a more
prominent place in Hegel's thought. The upshot of his Jena period was his first
major work, the Phenomenology ofSpirit, that he published in 1807. In this work
1 The Secret ofHegel (London: Longman, 1865), by James Hutchison Stirling, was the first book
about Hegel in the English language.
2 These essays were not published until 1907. Most of them are translated by T. M. Knox in
Hegel's Early Theological Writings (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1948).

Introduction

Geist has many of the meanings that it is given in the Encyclopaedia. (But not all
the meanings, since the Phenomenology does not contain anything correspond­
ing to the section on 'anthropology' in the Encyclopaedia or to the section on
'psychology'.) In a brief advertisement for his book Hegel said that it
conceives the various forms of the spirit as stations on its way into itself, the way by
which it becomes pure knowledge or absolute spirit. Thus the main sections of the
science . . . consider: consciousness, self-consciousness, observing reason and active reas­
on, spirit itself as ethical spirit, cultured and moral spirit, and finally spirit as religious
spirit in its different forms. The wealth of appearances of spirit, which at first sight seems
chaotic, is presented in its necessity: imperfect appearances dissolve and pass into higher
ones that are their proximate truth. They reach the ultimate truth initially in religion, and
then in science, the result of the whole. 3

By the time the book was published, Hegel had left Jena, because the university
was closed after Napoleon's victory at the battle of Jena in 1806. For about a
year he edited a Napoleonic newspaper in Bamberg in Bavaria. Then, in 1808,
he was appointed headmaster of a gymnasium in Nuremberg. There he gave
lectures on various philosophical themes, including phenomenology of spirit
and 'philosophical encyclopaedia'.4 He married Marie von Tucher in 1811 and,
between 1812 and 1816, published the Science ofLogic. This work won him a
professorship at Heidelberg, where in 1817 he published his Encyclopaedia of
the Phiwsophical Sciences in Outline as a textbook to accompany his lectures.
It consisted of three parts: logic (a shorter and modified version of the Science
of Logic), philosophy of nature, and philosophy of Geist. It was divided into
consecutively numbered paragraphs, often brief and obscure, but to be expanded
and explained in his lectures. To some paragraphs he added 'Remarks', which
illustrate the theme of the paragraph in a less formal, less cryptic way and were
intended to appeal to a wider readership.
In 1818 he took up a professorship in Berlin, which he held until his death in
1831. In 1821 he published the Philosophy ofRight, covering roughly the same
ground, in greater detail, as the section 'Objective Mind' in the Encyclopaedia. In
1827 he published the Encyclopaedia in a second edition that was nearly twice as
long as the first, mainly as a result of increasing and expanding the Remarks. He
published a slightly longer third edition in 1830. The work reached its present
form in the 1840s, when it was edited for the collected edition of Hegel's works
published by his pupils and friends. The three parts were produced separately, the
Logic in 1840 by Leopold von Henning, the Philosophy of Nature in 1842 by
3 'Science', in Hegel, ofi:en means 'philosophy'. Here it refers, in its first occurrence, to what is
presented in the Phenomenology itself, and, in its second occurrence, to the philosophy proper (logic,
philosophy of nature, and philosophy of mind) to which the Phenomenowgy was originally intended
as an introduction.
4 Hegel' s notes for these lectures were published by Karl Rosenkranz in 1844. They are translated
by A. V. Miller in Phiwsophical Propaedeutic (Oxford: Blackwell, 1986).

Karl Ludwig Michelet, and the Philosophy of Mind in 1845 by Ludwig Bou­
mann. It was these editors who added the Zusiitze, 'Additions', from Hegel's
lectures on these subjects. Some of his lectures were also published separately:
on aesthetics, on the history of philosophy, on philosophy of history, and on
philosophy of religion. These too shed light on the corresponding sections of the
Encyclopaedia, especially on the Philosophy of Mind.s
T H E ENCYCL OPAEDIA

The 1830 edition of Hegel's Encyclopaedia has the following overall structure.
It begins with the Prefaces to all three editions. The most interesting of these is
the second, which discusses the relationship between religion and philosophy and
the question whether philosophy is pantheistic.6 There follows a long introduc­
tion, discussing the general nature of philosophy and of logic in particular. Then
Hegel supplies a critique of his predecessors-primarily Leibniz and his follow­
ers, Kant and F. H. Jacobi7 -which, he suggests, may be a better introduction
to his system than the Phenomenology of Spirit was (Enc. I, §25). After a brisk
account of the three aspects of the logical method-'intellect', 'dialectic' or 'neg­
ative reason', and 'speculation' or 'positive reason'8-the Logic proper begins at
§84.
Like the Encyclopaedia as a whole, the Logic is divided into three pans. The
first is the 'Doctrine of Being'. It begins with 'pure being', the simplest of all
concepts, without which we cannot begin to conceive the world. But pure being,
being with no specifications, is equivalent to 'nothing' and passes over into noth­
ing. 'Nothing', however, is equivalent to being, so it passes back into being. This
5 Hegel's posthumous editors published only his lectures on subjects rhat were not dealt wirh at
lengrh in his published works. More recently his lectures on orher subjects, such as logic, nature,
and right have been published. Attempts have also been made to distinguish rhe courses rhat
Hegel gave in different years-his original editors stitched togerher materials from different years.
Especially relevant to Encyclopaedia Ill are his Jena lectures on Geist, translated by L. Rauch as Hegel

and the Human Spirit: A Tramlation of the jena Lectures on the Philosophy ofSpirit (1805-6) with
Commentary ((Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1983).
6 In Wallace's translation of rhe first part of rhe Encyclopaedia, The Logic of Hegel (2nd edn.,

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1892), rhe Prefaces are summarized, but not translated. They are
now translated in a more recent version, The Encyclopaedia Logic (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1991),
trans. T. Geraets, H. Harris and W. Suchting.
7 Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi (1743-1819) argued rhat immediate feeling and fairh are rhe basis
of all our beliefS, including in particular religious beliefS.
8 'Reason' translates Vernunft, which contrasts wirh rhe more rigid and static Verstand.
Translators of Kant and Hegel usually render Verstand as 'understanding'. I depart from
tradition, preferring 'intellect' for rhree reasons: (1) 'Intellect' generates an adjective, 'intellectual'
(verrtin
i dig) - and also orhers from rhe same stem such as 'intelligent' and 'intelligible'-rhat is not
easily confused wirh rhe noun. (2) 'Intellect' conveys rhe ideas of separation and clarity, which Hegel
associates wirh Verstand, better rhan 'understanding' does. An intellect may be 'sharp', 'penetrating',
or 'piercing', whereas 'understanding' suggests agreement and symparhy. (3) The medieval ancestor
of Hegel's (and Kant's) distinction between Verstand and Vernunft was rhe distinction between
intellectus and ratio.

Introduction

oscillation between the two amounts to 'becoming'. But becoming subsides and
congeals into Dasein, 'determinate being', a fusion of being and nothing.9 An
entity has a definite nature or quality (its 'being') that excludes a range of other
natures or qualities {its non-being or 'nothing'). From the categories of quality we
proceed to those of quantity(magnitude, number, etc.) , and finally to 'measure',
where quality and quantity intertwine. (A human being, for example, necessarily
changes its shape as it increases in size.)
The second division of Logic is the 'Doctrine of Essence'. It considers con­
cepts that capture, more obviously than those in the first division, the relation­
ships between entities, and the inner nature underlying their outer appearance.
Thus these concepts come in correlated pairs, such as essence-appearance, iden­
tity-difference, thing-propenies, substance-accidents, and cause-effect.
The third and final division of the Logic is the 'Doctrine of the Concept'.1o
Like the preceding divisions, this contains three sections. The first deals with the
'subjective concept'. It considers the subject matter of traditional logic, the vari­
eties of concepts, judgements, and inferences or syllogisms. (Despite his use of
the word 'subjective' Hegel tends to regard concepts, judgements, and syllogisms
as objective in a way that traditional logic does not. A concept is, for him, not
simply a mental or a linguistic entity, but is embedded in things and determ­
ines their structure and their growth. Judgements and syllogisms are similarly
implanted in the nature of things and not simply our ways of representing the
nature of things.) The second section deals with the 'object'. There are three main
types of object. The lowest type is mechanical. An example of this is the solar sys­
tem, though higher types of entity, such as the mind, are often regarded as mech­
anical-in Hegel's view, inappropriately. Next comes the chemical object-for
example, the compounding of an acid and an alkali to form a salt. Finally, there
is 'teleology', in which an agent exploits the mechanical and chemical propenies
of an object to impose its purpose on it. With this unification of a purpose (i.e.
the agent's concept) and an object, we reach the third section: the 'Idea', the unity
of the concept and the object.11 The first case of this is life or the living organ­
ism, which cannot, in Hegel's view, be explained mechanically or chemically, but

9 Heidegger has since adopted the word 'Dasein' to refer specifically to human being(s) and
sometimes stresses its literal meaning: 'being [sein] there [dz]'. Hegel's use of the word is different.
He applies it to anything that has a definite character. In Enc. Ill, it usually contrasts with the
'concept' of something, and I have generally translated it as 'reality' or 'embodiment'.
to Hegel's word for 'concept', Begriff, is often translated (by, for example, Wallace and
A. V. Miller) as 'Notion', in pan because Kant used 'notio' as its Latin equivalent. I prefer
to translate it as 'concept', a word that has a more secure position in English philosophical discourse.
11 The initial capital in 'Idea' is intended to distinguish Hegel's word Idee from the word
Vorstellung, which I usually translate as 'representation', but, when this becomes unbearable, as
'idea'. A Vorstellung is roughly an idea in the ordinary sense of the word 'idea', whereas an Idee is
more like a Platonic idea. In Hegel's usage an Idee is the unity of a Begrijfand its Objekt, though
he often uses other words, such as Realitiit ('reality') or Dasein ('reality, embodiment') in place of

Objekt.

only in terms of the concept that it embodies. A more advanced case is 'cogni­
tion' and the 'will', which, in their different ways, unifY a concept or concepts
with objects. The final case, and the climax of the Logic as a whole, is the 'abso­
lute Idea'. This represents Hegel's own Logic, which, as thought about thought,
is a perfect match between the object, the thought that is thought about, and the
concept, the thought that thinks about it. The Logic thus in a way returns to its
beginning, to pure being.
There is another way in which the Logic returns to its beginning. The abso­
lute Idea represents not only the Logic itself, but also the way in which logical
categories or thoughts inform and structure the world. The convergence, within
logic, between the concept and the object prefigures and explains the convergence
between logic (or the 'logical Idea') -and the world outside logic. Thus at the end
of the Logic we turn to Philosophy of Nature and this begins with an account
of space, which embodies (though only approximately) the first category of logic,
pure being. In this part of the Encyclopaedia Hegel ranges through the science of
his day, considering such topics as time, motion, the solar system, crystals, elec­
triciry, plants, and animals. He concludes with the death of an animal and this
provides him with a (somewhat fanciful) transition to Geist, the theme of the
third pan of the Encyclopaedia.
Mind, like nature, embodies the logical Idea and is structured by it. In partic­
ular, the Philosophy of Mind follows the path prescribed in the third division of
the Logic. It begins with the concept of mind: the mind is essentially something
that strives to know itself. This essential characteristic of mind generates (Hegel
assures us) its whole development: its emergence from its 'soulful' state in the
womb and in infancy, its drive to comprehend the world, its capaciry for per­
ception, thought, and will, its conquest of the natural world and its formation of
families, societies, and states. Eventually, it rises above the secular world to find
itself as 'mind as such', mind freed from the confines of nature. It does this in
religion, especially the Christian religion, which displays in a pictorial form the
tripartite structure of realiry that Hegel's philosophy presents in a prosaic form.
So finally mind turns to philosophy. Now mind not only becomes fully aware of
the concept of mind. It also gains knowledge of the concept as such, of the logical
Idea that underlies both nature and mind. For philosophy begins with logic, and
this takes us right back to the beginning of the Encyclopaedia. The Encyclopae­
dia circles back on itself, and in doing this (Hegel believes) it reflects the circular
structure of realiry.
SUBJECTIVE MIND

The Encyclopaedia presents, then, an ordered system that returns to its own begin­
ning, a circular system. The driving force behind this movement is the mind
itself. For mind (Hegel believes) is implicit even in nature and accounts for its
hierarchical structure. In nature, however, mind is only implicit. Nature is not

XIV

Introduction

conscious. The mind in it is no more than the thoughts or categories embedded
in it. Mind emerges explicitly only in human beings. And this is the theme of the
third part of the Encycwpaedia.
But what is the mind? Hegel's word is Geist, which does not exactly corres­
pond to the English word 'mind', which has in fact no single equivalent in the
English language. The most common translations are 'mind' and 'spirit', one or
other of which is usually appropriate for Hegel's use of the term. But within this
broad range Geist takes on a bewildering variety of apparently distinct senses.
In its most general sense, 'mind' contrasts with 'nature' and with such terms as
'matter'. Nature and matter are the concern of the Philosophy of Nature. This
deals with space, time, plants, animals, and so on. (Animals do not, in Hegel's
view, have minds nor are they in his sense 'conscious'. But this does not imply
that they do not, for example, feel pain.) Philosophy of Mind, by contrast, deals
with what is specifically human, including for example the state, art, and reli­
gion-topics that do not usually fall within the range of what we call 'philosophy
of mind'. 'Mind' also contrasts with 'logic'. It does so in at least two respects.
First, logic is 'abstract'. It deals with concepts of great generality, the concept of
'substance' for example, which apply equally readily to both nature and mind.
Secondly, although logic governs our thought and is something that we think
about, Hegel's Logic is not, officially at least, concerned with our thinking about,
or in terms of, logic. It is concerned only with logical concepts and forms them­
selves, and these do not fall within the scope of the human or therefore of the
philosophy of mind.
There is, secondly, a more restricted sense of Geist in which it contrasts with
See/e, 'soul'. Philosophers before Hegel often regarded the 'soul' as a spiritual sub­
stance distinct from, though temporarily lodged in, the human body. In Hegel's
preferred sense, 'See/e' is closer in meaning to Aristotle's word 'psuche', which is
what makes something alive. Aristotle concluded that plants and animals, as well
as men, have souls simply because they are alive, though he did not believe that
their souls were immortal. Hegel discusses plants and animals in his Philosophy
of Nature, but he hardly raises the question whether they have souls or not. In
fact, Hegel is less inclined than Aristotle is to regard human beings as 'rational
animals', that is, as similar to animals, only with reason added to them. For him
men differ from animals all the way down. Nevertheless for Hegel 'soul' refers
primarily to those aspects of human beings in which, though they differ from
animals and a fortiori from plants, they are still closely connected to nature. Thus
'Anthropology', literally the 'study of man', but for Hegel the study of the soul,
deals with such themes as the foetus, racial differences, the course of a human
life, sleep and waking, and sexuality. Geist, by contrast, refers to the more intel­
lectual or rational features of humanity. One important difference between Seele
and Geist is this. Geist, the mind, differentiates itself more or less sharply both
from other minds and from the external world of which it is conscious. A prop­
erly working mind knows that the objects of which it is conscious-trees, houses,

Introduction

XV

rivers-are distinct from itself. It knows that they exist even when it is not con­
scious of them. It knows that they have aspects which it does not currently, and
perhaps never will, perceive. It distinguishes between the hot fire and the pain it
receives from it, locating the heat in the external world and the pain in itself. It
also knows that other people are similar to, yet distinct from, itself. They perceive
roughly the same objects as it itself does, but perceive them from a different per­
spective. Other people, I come to realize, do not know everything I know. That is
why I can lie to them. They know things that I do not know. That is why they can
lie to me.
The soul, by contrast, does not draw a boundary between itself and other
things or between itself and other people. This is especially true of the foetus,
and to a lesser extent of the infant. It is the job of the mind, not the soul,
to mark these boundaries. It begins to do this in the section that Hegel calls
the 'Phenomenology of Mind' .12 'Phenomenology' is literally the 'study of
appearance(s) '. Characteristically, Hegel probably has in play several different
senses of the word 'appearance'. Among other things, it means the 'emergence'
of mind. The mind appears on the scene. It emerges from the self-enclosed,
self-absorbed soul-state of infancy to make contact with a world distinct from
itself and with people other than itself. It both differentiates itself from its
'other' and enters into relationship with it. When the mind has fully emerged,
it retreats (Hegel implies) back into itself. In the section called 'Psychology, the
Mind' Hegel gives an account of the powers and development of the mind that
makes only occasional reference to the external world on which these powers are
exercised. The relationship of 'psychology' to 'phenomenology' differs radically
from the relationship of 'anthropology' to either. The soul constitutes, and
anthropology describes, a stage or level of the human being distinct from and
prior to the fully developed mind. A human being, a foetus for example, might be
a soul without yet being a mind. Conversely, in a fully developed mind, the soul
plays only a subsidiary and subdued role. But 'phenomenology' and 'psychology'
12 The relationship between this section of the Encyclopaedia and Hegel's 1807 book of the same
title is a vexed problem. The book was originally intended as an introduction to the 'system of
science', which was to consist of logic, philosophy of nature, and philosophy of mind. But Hegel did
not complete this plan. In a 'Remark' to the Encyclopaedia added to the 1827 edition (§25) he says
that the book expanded beyond his original design and came to incorporate much of the material
intended for inclusion in the philosophies of nature and mind. This explains why he abandoned the
idea of making his book the introduction to his system. But why did he then include a truncated
version of the· book in his encyclopaedia? The answer is this. The book, roughly speaking, describes
the ascent of mind from innocence to philosophy. This is clearly an appropriate introduction
to philosophy: an account of how philosophy emerges is one way of leading Hegel's pupils to
philosophy from their relative innocence. But it is also an appropriate, perhaps indispensable,
part of the story of mind. Mind does, afrer all, ascend from innocence to philosophy. So when
the Phenomenology drops out as an introduction to philosophy, it naturally finds a place in the
Philosophy of Mind. It might even occupy both positions, serving both as an introduction to
philosophy as a whole and as a strand in the philosophy of mind. But since Hegel's Encyclopaedia
is circular, it implicitly occupies both positions anyway. Nevertheless, Hegel still remained attached
to the book. He began to revise it for a second edition shortly before his death.

Introduction

do not describe different stages or levels of the mind. They simply describe the
mind from different points of view. No one could have the powers that Hegel
includes under the heading of psychology without also being conscious of objects
and other people, without being self-conscious. Conversely, no one could be
conscious and self-conscious without having those powers.

OBJECTIVE MIND
Nevertheless, Hegel regards 'psychology' as a distinct stage of mind, a stage in
which the mind withdraws into itself, in order to examine itself without regard to
the external world. This withdrawal of the mind is the culmination of what Hegel
calls the'subjective mind', which is (roughly speaking) the individual mind. The
soul, consciousness (the subject matter of'Phenomenology') and the'free' mind
(the subject matter of'Psychology') all fall under the general heading'Subjective
Mind'. It is within the sphere of 'subjective mind' that the soul is distinguished
from the mind proper. Now we come to

objective mind.

In a typically Hegeli­

an transition the withdrawal of the mind into itself is succeeded by the mind's
return to the external world. The mind has already ventured into the external
world, in the form of'consciousness'. But now it is the external world with a dif­
ference. The world of which the mind was'conscious' was initially a strange and
alien world, a world of natural entities and of uncivilized, hostile people. Even
when the mind came to understand this world it remained the natural rather than
the social world. Its relations with other people were relations of dominance and
subjection. Such understanding, dominance and subjection are essential steps on
the way to objective mind. But they are not the same as objective mind. When
mind is objective it has completed its task of taming and permeating the world.
The world is no longer a world of merely natural entities and antagonistic people.
Such natural entities as figure in it are the raw materials from which we produce
goods for consumption and exchange. They are transformed in the houses we
dwell in, the parks in which we stroll, and the buildings in which we conduct our
public affairs. The people we primarily encounter are not our enemies, but the
members of family: our parents, spouse, and children. They are, again, in 'civil
society', our employers or employees, our business partners or rivals, our fellow
guild-members, and so on. And finally we encounter or are at any rate affected
by the various officials who manage the affairs of state. All this is the work of
objective mind.
Objective mind is closely related to the

Volksgeist,

the 'mind of a people' or

'national mind'. The social and political order that Hegel describes under the
heading 'Objective Mind' does not embrace the whole of humanity. Human
beings are divided into 'peoples', the Germans, the French, the Italians, the
English, and so on, each of them united by their shared customs, sentiments,
language, and history. Some of these peoples are organized into societies of
roughly the rype that Hegel describes. (What Hegel actually describes is probably

Introduction

XVll

no existing society, but an idealized version of the Prussian constitution. 13) A
people's society-its family arrangements, its laws, and so on-is informed and
permeated by the 'mind' or 'spirit' of that people, by its general way of looking at
things and doing things. It is, in Hegel's view, neither desirable nor possible for
the whole of humanity to unite in a single society governed by a single world­
state. If humanity were to retain their present diversity of cultures, religions,
languages, etc., the bonds between them would be too loose for them to form
a single cohesive society. If humanity were to adopt a single language, culture,
and perhaps religion, then the bonds between them would also be loosened, since
there would be no significant conflicts to weld them together. In either case,
Hegel might argue, this all-embracing world-state would share the fate of the
Roman Empire, disintegrating into a collection of self-engrossed individuals. The
unity of the state, he believes, depends on its being one among several such states,
whose occasional bouts of warfare wrest their citizens from absorption in their
private affairs out into the public realm. There are, then, a diversity of 'national
minds' and Hegel sees no prospect of their homogenisation into a single mind
with the same degree of coherence and unity as a national mind.
There is, however, a single mind at work in all this. Hegel calls it the

geist,

Welt­

the 'world-mind'. It embraces not so much the variety of national minds

in existence at any given time, but the national minds that have emerged over
the course of history. A national mind does not, in Hegel's view, last for ever.
It arises, flourishes, and declines, summoned for judgement before the coun of
the world. At any given period of world-history, one national mind is dom­
inant, representing the cutting edge of the advance of humanity. First it was
China, then India, then Persia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, and finally the 'German­
ic peoples', the Christian civilization ofWestern Europe. One might object that
these supposedly successive civilizations are for the most pan too disparate, too
disconnected, to constitute the work of a single mind or spirit in the way in which
a single civilization could be regarded, with some plausibility, as the work of a
single national mind. This objection may be intensified into the doubt whether
there has been, until quite recently, such a thing as 'world-history'. Until some
way into the nineteenth century, events in, say, China had little if any effect on
events in, say, England. Events in China could not become known in England
until several months after their occurrence, if they ever became known at

all . So,

we might say, there was Chinese history, Indian history, English history, perhaps
even European history, but hardly any world-history. And without world-history
it makes little sense to speak of a 'world-mind'. A mind must have more coher­
ence than we can plausibly attribute to most of humanity's history. But Hegel has

13 Allan W. Wood argues, in his Hegel's Ethical Thought (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1990), 13, Jhat Jhe state Jhat Hegel describes in his Philosophy of Right 'bears a striking
resemblance' not to Jhe actual Prussian state, but to Jhe plan for a new constitution drafted by
Wilhelm von Humboldt and K. A. von Hardenberg in 1819, but never put into practice.

given an answer to this. It is the dominant culture of each epoch that is the main
focus of the world-mind's spotlight. Other civilizations, even if they have been
dominant in the past, recede into the background. It does not matter if West­
ern Europe, in the period of its dominance, knows little of what is happening
in China. Nothing of great significance is happening in China, and China has
descended into what we might call the subconscious of world-mind. What mat­
ters, therefore, is not primarily the coherence of cultures contemporary with each
other, but the coherence of the historical sequence of dominant cultures: China,
India, Persia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, Western Europe.

ABSOLUTE MIND
Hegel associates this world-mind with 'divine providence'. Sure enough God
makes his final appearance shortly afterwards in'Absolute Mind'. Absolute mind
comprises art, religion, and philosophy, though religion, Hegel says, is the dom­

inant term of the triad. (In Hegel's view, art, especially pre-Christian art, has a
more or less close connection with religion.) Why is this mind 'absolute'? It is
the final term of a triad: subjective mind-objective mind-absolute mind. So
we might expect, from our acquaintance with Hegel's other triads, that abso­
lute mind will be a combination of subjective and objective minds or, what may
amount to the same thing, a restoration of subjective mind on a higher level. One
obvious difference between subjective and objective mind is this. Subjective mind
is the same for everyone. Every normal human being, whether in China, India,
Persia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, or modern Europe has more or less the characterist­
ics outlined under the heading'Subjective Mind'. What Hegel describes may in
fact be a peculiarly European mind, and a nineteenth-century mind at that. But
that is surely not his intention. His intention is to describe the individual mind as
such. With objective mind it is otherwise. More or less every individual mind, at
least in the period of recorded history, belongs to a community that is an objec­
tification of mind. But individuals do not

all belong to the same communiry nor

do they all occupy the same role in their community. Human beings are divided
up into groups-'peoples' -with distinctive cultures. They are divided up into
historical epochs. Within their sociery individuals

are

divided up into nobles and

commoners, traders and farmers, and so on. Worst of all, in some societies, in fact
in practically

all

pre-Christian societies and in some Christian ones too, people

are divided up into slave and free. Now the aim of mind, Hegel insists, is to know
itself, to know mind as such. This is what Hegel claims to have done in his Phiw­
sophy ofMind. But how can we know mind as such if mind is divided in this way?
Surely all that we can know is some particular type of mind, the Roman mind,
the mind of the free man, the mind of the worker, the mind of the nobleman, and
so on. We have already seen that Hegel despairs of uniting everyone in a single
society. Nor would this help much unless everyone had the same role. Even then,

Introduction

if mind was to know itself, everyone would have to reflect on themselves, reflect,
that is, on mind as such.
At this point absolute mind resolves our dilemma. Here the mind attempts to
rise above its historical and social setting to consider mind as such. At first it is
not very successful in this. It cannot easily extricate mind from its entanglement
in nature, let alone its social context. The Greeks achieved a rounded, realist­
ic ponrayal of human beings, but they presented their surface appearance, not
their inner depths. The man they presented was Greek man, Greek mind, not
mind as such. But Christianity is different. Christianity reveals the inner depth
of man. It also reveals the breadth of mind. It appeals to all men, Greek and
Jew, male and female, slave and free. It presents, or at least begins to present,
mind as such, mind purified of nature and of local peculiarities. Philosophy,
the highest term of the triad, completes this process. A philosopher inevitably
belongs to a nation. Philosophers are Chinese, Indian, Greek, Roman, German,
or French. But the philosophy they produce does not appeal essentially only to
members of their own nation. Greek religion is specifically Greek. It makes little
sense for a Jew or a Persian, embedded in Jewish or Persian culture, to wor­
ship the gods of Greece. But Greek philosophy, Platonism for example, is not
specifically Greek. It is presented as true for everyone. Anyone, whether Jew or
Greek, male or female, slave or free,

can

become a Platonist. If someone converts

from Platonism to, say, Cartesianism, they do not need to change their nation­
ality from Greek to French. A philosophy may of course consider the differences
and affinities between Greek minds, Chinese minds, and German minds. It may
also argue, as Hegel does, that its capacity to do this adequately and its capa­
city to consider mind as such, stem from the objective mind of Western Europe
and its Christian religion. But in doing so, philosophy is not identifYing itself
with, or appealing to, any panicular type of mind, not even Western European
mind. It presents its findings as true for anyone and everyone, true for mind as
such.
There is therefore a peculiar affinity between Christianity and philosophy.
Both are concerned with mind as such and are presented to mind as such, to
everyone. But there is a difference. Christianity tells a story about God, who is
himself a mind distinct from any human mind. He then generates a son, who is
again a mind. And when, after his death and resurrection, the son has returned to
God, another mind descends on humanity, the holy 'spirit'. Philosophy is grate­
ful for this story, but does not take it literally. It interprets God the father as the
'logical Idea', which underlies 'nature' - the philosophical counterpan of God
the son14- and then the development of the human mind (the Holy Spirit, as
it were) , whose highest phase is philosophy, which comprehends the logical Idea,
nature, and mind itself.

14 For Hegel, Christ or the 'son' represenrs both nature and

man.

Introduction
H E G EL' S MYTH ?

Hegel, we might protest, has reworked the Christian story into another story,
which though less pictorial is no less fanciful. It is a story of mind's endeav­
our to disentangle itself from the natural world and from the local peculiarities
of the social world in order to know itself in its puriry, to achieve, as Hegel
puts it, its 'freedom' and 'truth'. Why should we accept this story? Does it have
any objective status? Or is it j ust Hegel's way of arranging the multifarious facts
about humanity into a satisfYing narrative? Even as a narrative, it has conspicuous
defects. In the first place, it does not follow a single time-sequence. It begins with
the soul, and this (apart from its anomalous resurgence in deranged adults) pre­
cedes in time the 'appearance' of mind, described in the 'Phenomenology'. Then
the powers of the mind are considered in 'Psychology', but these do not, very
obviously, temporally follow the 'appearance' of mind. Objective mind comes
next. Within objective mind there is a temporal sequence driven by the world­
spirit, one culture giving way to the next. But objective mind as such does not
follow subjective mind in time. There was no time that Hegel knew of when
human beings with the powers considered by 'Psychology' did not form social
groups. (Objective mind may temporally follow the state of nature described in
the early part of the 'Phenomenology', but Hegel does not regard that as serious
history.) . Next comes absolute mind: art, religion, and philosophy. Art does not
emerge later than objective mind, let alone the specific institutions that Hegel
describes under the heading 'Objective Mind'. Art has been around as long as
anything Hegel could recognize as humaniry. The same is true of religion. But
Hegel avoids this difficulty by speaking here primarily of 'revealed religion', that
is Christianity, and by merging earlier religions into his account of art. Finally we
come to philosophy. This emerged later than art and religion. Its beginnings in
Europe are generally located in Greece in the sixth century

BC.

But it pre-dates

revealed religion by at least 500 years. Even the first indisputably great philosoph­
er, Plato, was born 427 years before the supposed birth of Christ. Perhaps Plato
did not get to the bottom of mind as such. But Hegel had a high esteem for the
philosophy of mind of his pupil, Aristotle.
Hegel's Philosophy of Mind does not follow a single temporal sequence. Sup­
pose we accept, nevertheless, that Hegel presents a single narrative of a journey
from the natural soul to mind's full self-knowledge. Is there a single subject of
this narrative? What is that subject? It is

Geist,

Hegel says. But

' Geist',

as Hegel

uses it, seems to be applied too liberally to denote a single subject. Subjective
mind, objective mind, national mind, world-mind, absolute mind, the holy spir­
it: what links these together to form a single developing mind? Perhaps they bear
a family-resemblance to each other, But that is surely not enough for them to
constitute a single subject. In any case, it easy to doubt whether there is such
a thing as objective mind, national mind, or world-mind, let alone the holy

spirit. This doubt operates at two levels. First, one might question the ontological
status of societies, nations, world-history, even of philosophy. Do they amount
to anything more than arrangements of individuals - citizens, historical agents,
philosophers, and their audience? Secondly, one might resist the suggestion that
such entities, whatever their ontological status, are 'minds' in a sense sufficiently
close to that of an individual 'mind' to constitute a prolongation of the individual
mind. Yet this is what Hegel requires. It is mind, a single mind, that makes the
journey from nature to self-knowledge. It begins as soul, and here it is more or
less continuous throughout humanity, in fact (Hegel suggests) throughout nature
as a whole. There are no clear boundaries between one soul and another soul,
or between the soul and its natural environment. With the 'appearance' of mind
(in contrast to 'soul') boundaries are established, between one mind and another
mind, and between a mind and the world. Mind 'as such', considered in 'Psy­
chology', withdraws into itself as a distinct, individual mind. Then, as objective
mind, it re-establishes its connections with other individual minds and with the
surrounding world. But now the individual mind retains its individuality. It is
not lost in other minds and in the world. Its relations with other minds are intelli­
gibly structured, and the world it inhabits is permeated and ordered by mind. But
this objective mind is localized in space and time. It is not mind as such, not even
the objectification of mind as such. The closest that we come to mind as such in
this sphere is the temporal sequence of dominant national minds presented by the
world-mind. However, the peoples whose minds are thus objectified are not con­
tent to remain within the confines of their secular social and political life. They
try to make sense of the cosmos and of their own place in it. They express their
attempt and its outcome in their religion and their art, which in its early stages is
closely intertwined with religion. They worship gods who represent their concep­
tion of mind as such. But their religion is not entirely separate from their secular
life. It informs and sustains their political and social institutions. Religion is a
sort of bridge between localized objective mind and mind as such. Pre-Christian
religions, as we have seen, tend to project their localized objective mind onto the
divine plane. But Christianity purports to avoid this. It presents mind as such for
all human beings. Philosophy does this too, only purged of the pictorial elements
of Christianity. Mind has returned to the unity from which it began, but now
on a higher level. Mind now knows itself inside and out. It

can

compose a philo­

sophy of mind, something of which it is not capable at any lower stage of itself.
Mind has thus become 'true' mind. It has become its own object.

IN D EF ENCE OF H E G EL
In the hope of avoiding these criticisms of Hegel' s procedure, we might con­
sider the stages of mind not as temporally successive stages but as aspects of
an individual person. The person begins life as a soul. Here he is not clearly

XXll

Introduction

differentiated from other persons and their souls or from the external world. A
person's soul-life persists into adult life. But then, except in cases of derangement,
the soul is subordinate to the person's objective consciousness. The emergence
of objective consciousness is described in the 'Phenomenology of Mind' . Here
a person becomes aware of himself as one person among other persons distinct
from, though similar to, himself, inhabiting an orderly world to which they are
cognitively and practically related. Such objective consciousness depends on the
mental powers considered in 'Psychology'. Hegel presents this section as a sort of
withdrawal of mind into itself. But there is, at this stage, really no such withdraw­
al. The person we are considering does not yet describe his own mental powers
and activities. He can only do this properly when he becomes a philosopher.
So far we have focused more or less on the single individual, albeit an individu­
al whose self-consciousness requires an awareness of other individuals. Now we
turn to 'Objective Mind' and consider the person as a property owner, as a family
member, a participant in civil society, and a citizen of a state. All this does not
leave the individual unchanged. The social and political structure permeates the
individual mind. Even non-Hegelians acknowledge this:

The whole process of choosing has itself an influence on one's identifications, therefore
on the self, and therefore on the goals one seeks to maximize. On the whole, the process
of making market choices tends to narrow one's identifications to the individual or, at
the most, to the family. The process of voting, on the other hand, with all that it pre­
supposes in the way of discussion and techniques of reciprocity, tends to broaden one's
identifications beyond the individual and the family. I 5
We need not insist, then, that a social order is itself a 'mind' larger than the minds
of the individuals composing it. We need only refer to the enlargement of the
individual mind stemming from its relationships to other individual minds. We
can ,

if need be, individualize the 'world-mind' in a similar way. An individual in a

society, say a German individual in nineteenth-century Prussia, not only absorbs
the culture of his own society. He also contains within him, more or less impli­
cidy, the cultures or mentalities of the societies that preceded it. The German
mentality has developed out of the Greek mentality, in such a way that although
it is more complex than the Greek mentality it is intelligibly related to it and
retains the Greek mentality as a subordinate part or element of itself. And sim­
ilarly with other historic cultures. Scratch a modern German and you will find a
Roman, a Greek, and even an Egyptian buried within him. This is why he

can

understand them. At this stage the individual is of course only dimly aware of the
history that lies behind him and which, in a way, lies buried within him. It takes
a historian to unearth and clarifY the details. But he is likely to be aware that his

social order has not been around from eternity and also that it will not endure
everlastingly.

RELIGION
Germans of the early nineteenth century were religious. Humans throughout
history have for the most part been religious. They believed in a supernatural,
supersocial realm inhabited by one or more gods and they engaged in rituals dir­
ected towards these gods. Such beliefs and conduct seem to come as naturally to
human beings as does their association with their own kind. Human beings are
religious almost as inevitably as they are gregarious. (Not everyone is religious, of
course. But nor is everyone gregarious.16) Why this should be so is far from clear.
No religious beliefs are obviously true, and religious conduct does not provide
any obvious benefits comparable to those we derive from cooperation with oth­
ers. The crucial factor, Hegel believes, is man himself. Man is a finite creature.
He lives at a panicular time in a panicular place. He has a particular position in a
society, a society that is, moreover, only one of the very many societies that there
are and have been. For the most pan man views the world from the panicular
position he occupies in it, from what we might call the 'worm' s-eye view' . But
man is also 'infinite'. He can, in thought and imagination, survey the world from
a perspective independent of his panicular location in the world, adopting the
bird's-eye view or, as we might call it, the 'God's-eye view' . That humans are able
to adopt such a perspective is one of their main differences from other animals.
Non-human animals, we might plausibly suppose, are aware only of their imme­
diate surroundings in the more or less immediate present. They do not reflect on
the past or the future. They do not consider how things look from the viewpoint
of their prey or their predator. Humans are different. They range in imagination
over remote times and places. They enter sympathetically into the viewpoints of
others, of other people, other tribes, even other species, and even the gods. Nat­
urally their attempts to do this are only sporadic and generally imperfect. When
they ascribe such a viewpoint to a god or gods, the gods they concoct are too sim­
ilar to themselves to be properly godlike. Their gods are too Egyptian, too Greek,
or even too human. (The mythical transformations of gods into animals are, in
part, an attempt to overcome such limitations.) But at least they tried. They were
attempting, Hegel would say, to rise to the standpoint of 'mind as such', mind
unhampered by local peculiarities and limitations. And this attempt, he would
add, is not simply an agreeable addition to their everyday worm' s-eye view of
things. Their worm's-eye view could not be what it is if it were not for their abil­
ity to adopt the God's-eye view. Even in their everyday, unreflective life, men do
not see things and conduct themselves in the way that other animals do. And this

of his kind' (William James, The Principles ofPsychology (New York: Dover, 1950}, ii. 430.}

is because of their ability to rise above their everyday, unreflective life. We can,
for example, critically assess our everyday desires and also our everyday beliefs.
What I , as a worm, desire may not be worthy, and what I believe may not be true,
when surveyed from a higher standpoint. In doing this, we need not, of course,
ascend, or even purport to ascend, all the way up to the God's-eye view- as,
say, Descarres claimed to do. We can go some way up the ladder, without going
right to the top. But Hegel would say that our ability and readiness to advance
up the ladder at all presupposes that we have some conception, however vague or
fanciful, of what can be seen from the top of the ladder.
But why, it might be asked, should we ascribe the bird' s-eye view to gods? And
even if we do, why should we worship them? Some scientists and philosophers
seem eminently capable of adopting the 'infinite' viewpoint, without assigning it
to any god except perhaps metaphorically. The infinite viewpoint seems a distinct
matter from God. One can adopt the viewpoint without the god, though one
cannot, conversely, adopt the god without something of the viewpoint. Hegel's
response is this. Religious believers often regard a god as a mind, and a mind quite
distinct from any human mind. The Christian God, for example, is regarded as
an infinite mind, very different and quite distinct from the finite human mind.
But this is a mistake, albeit an entirely intelligible mistake. Gods may be minds,
but they are not distinct from the human mind. This is because the human mind
is not exclusively finite. It is
exclusively

man.

He is

both

both finite and infinite. So in a way man is not
and God. This becomes more or less explicit

man

in Christianity. Christ is both man and God. And Christ represents, in Hegel's
view, man in general. In pre-Christian religions man's divinity is only implicit,
obscured, for example, by the representation of gods in animal forms. In fact, for
most of human history man's essential divinity is only implicit. Divinity is not,
for Hegel, an all or nothing matter. Man

ascends to

God over the course of his­

tory. And this means not simply that man becomes aware of God or of his own
divinity, but that he gradually becomes God.
This might be taken as atheism in disguise. If God or gods are simply an aspect
of man, then God and gods do not really exist. They are on a par with other
human fictions such as Sherlock Holmes, flying saucers, and pink rats. But Hegel
would deny this. Sherlock Holmes, flying saucers, and pink rats are not essential
creations of the human mind. It may be essential to us that we create fictions,
but not these particular fictions. Our ability to adopt the 'infinite' viewpoint is,
by contrast, essential to us. We would not be recognizably human if we lacked
it altogether. It is then natural enough to ascribe this viewpoint to a superhu­
man mind or minds, conceived in accordance with the level of our culture. To
deny flatly the existence of gods or God is to underrate the reach and depth of
the human mind. The human mind is expansive and effervescent. It does not
remain lodged within our skulls. It ranges out to coalesce with the minds of other
human beings, and it ascends to the infinity of mind as such. So Hegel does not
deny the existence of these gods. He regards belief in them as a 'representation',

a pictorial version of the truths attained by the pure thinking of the philosopher,
especially the Hegelian philosopher, who is perhaps more godlike than the rest of
humanity.

CH RISTIANITY
What is so special about Christianity? One of its merits is that Christianity estab­
lishes what Hegel regards as a proper relationship berween the finite and the
infinite, berween the secular world and the world beyond. There are rwo main
ways in which we

can

go wrong about this. First, we may view them as separ­

ated by an unbridgeable gulf. Then we might respond to this in various ways.
We might focus exclusively on the secular world, more or less ignoring the world
beyond as unknowable and/or irrelevant. We might focus primarily on the world
beyond, regarding this secular world as valueless or evil, to be redeemed, if at
all, only if it is thoroughly subordinated to the world beyond. (In the 1807

nomenology ofSpirit Hegel

Phe­

had called this attitude the 'unhappy consciousness'.)

Or we might oscillate berween these rwo worlds, without discerning or establish­
ing any significant relation berween them. The second way in which we may go
wrong about the relation berween the finite and the infinite is by failing to distin­
guish them sufficiently from each other, by making their relationship too close.
Then we shall not regard the secular world as a properly independent world. We
shall see the hand of gods or God everywhere, and neglect the scientific explor­
ation of the natural world and the secular development of the world of mind.
In contrast to each of these errors, Christianity- especially, in Hegel's view,
Lutheran Christianity-distinguishes the rwo realms, but establishes an intelli­
gible rational relationship berween them. It inspires us to explore the world of
nature for its own sake, guided by our religious beliefs but not overwhelmed by
them. It encourages us to establish secular, constitutional regimes, keeping the
church (and religious spirituality) in its proper place and giving adherents of oth­
er religions, or of none, a share in public life.
That non-Christians as well as Christians are granted a share in public life and,
more generally, that Christianity does not ultimately tolerate the exclusion of any
human being from the community is a crucial step on the way to the discovery
of mind as suchY But what is a human being? Non-Christians or 'humanists'
tend to take human beings for granted, as a sheer biological fact. Whatever funda­
mental equality is ascribed to them is to be established by empirical inquiry. Even
when such equality is denied it is generally assumed at least that no human being
17 I n Hegel's Germany women did not have civic or citizen rights, though they had human
rights and were not seen as slaves. However, the exclusion of women from the affairs of state and,
more or less, from civil society is not an essential feature of Christianity. Genesis 2: 27 seems to
imply that women are as godlike as men: 'So God created man in his own image, in the image of
God created he him; male and female created he them'. (I owe this reference to the Revd Canon
Trevor Williams.)

should be enslaved by another human being or, presumably, by any other son of
being. 'Slavery is not natural' , we say. 'There are no natural slaves', not, at any
rate,

human

natural slaves. Hegel disagrees. Slavery, he thinks, is natural. What

could be more natural than enslaving one's defeated foe- except perhaps killing
and eating him? No matter whether the slave is a natural slave in Aristotle's sense,
deficient in rationality.18 Whether or not there are natural slaves, there are at any
rate natural enslavers. It comes naturally to us to enslave our opponents. But the
naturalness of slavery, Hegel insists, is not a point in its favour. It is precisely its
naturalness that is wrong with it. In opposing slavery Christianity appeals not to
nature, but to supernature. It postulates a God-man, a son of Platonic paradigm
of humanity as such, who marks out the boundaries of humankind by recog­
nizing them and preaching to them. What this means is that mind is extricated
from its natural integument, so that mind alone can decide what belongs to it. Of
course neither Christ nor mind

can

dispense altogether with the natural and the

biological. How does Christ decide to preach to men but to ride on a donkey, to
cast the demons into swine and not the swine fever into men? Only by empirical
observation of the differences between men, donkeys and swine. But on this basis
Christ extends and sharpens the boundaries of humanity, overriding the superfi­
cial variations, gradations, and borderline cases that empirical inquiry might find.
Man is then elevated to God's right hand, while the donkey is left with nothing
but a cross on its back.

PH ILOSOPHY
Hegel was a profoundly religious philosopher. Philosophy, h e believes, has the
same 'content' as religion, though it presents it in a different 'form'. This does
not mean, however, that Hegel is ensnared in religious dogmas or subservient to
ecclesiastical authority. For according to Hegel's interpretation of Christianity,
Christianity sets man free: free to engage in worldly intellectual and scientific
inquiry, free to set up secular states, free to produce non-religious, even irreligious
an, free to be enlightened. It is a mistake to think that Christianity enslaves us to

God and his arbitrary requirements. Previous religions may have done that, but
Christianity, properly interpreted, does not. It sets us free. Freedom is not our
natural condition. Our natural condition is oppression-oppression by nature,
by our rulers, by our community, even by the gods. Freedom has to be striven for,
and religion is, in Hegel's view, the central arena in which the battle is fought.
The outcome of the battle is the liberation granted us by Lutheran Christianity.
This liberation extends to philosophy too. Besides being a religious philosoph­
er, Hegel is also a profoundly secular philosopher. His study of nature follows,
1 8 Hegel avoids a head-on confrontation with Aristotle's definition of a natural slave by assuming
(incorrectly) that a slave was always the offSpring of slaves and that, conversely, the offspring of
slaves was always a slave. He therefore inferred that it was parentage, rather than defective capacity
for rational deliberation, that made someone a natural slave. See Enc. Ill, §433.

by and large, the science of his day. The state that he describes, and endorses,
in his

Encyckpaedia and in the Phiksophy ofRight,

is a thoroughly secular state.

He is alive to the historic importance of technology, though (unlike

Karl Marx)

he regards it as an instrument of humanity's spiritual advance rather than as the
force that drives it on.19 His interpretation of Christianity (a conventional Chris­
tian might well say)

all

but obliterates the distinction between God and man; it

makes man too much a God and God too much a man; and ultimately the object
ofHegel's worship is not God, but man.
It is the liberation bestowed by Christianity that enables Hegel to be both reli­
gious and secular. For the beneficiaries of this liberation need not leave the orbit
of Christianity. The Christian God, in Hegel's view, embraces what is other than
himself. For example, what seems to us secular an (such as Shakespeare's plays) is
for Hegel a son of religious an: in presenting the deeds and thoughts of men it
reveals an aspect of God. What seems to us a thoroughly secular state (such as that
described by Hegel) is a state nurtured and sustained by Christianity. Even the
atheist or agnostic discloses an aspect of God whose expression is generally stifled
or prohibited by other religions.2 0 Hegel did not profess atheism or agnosticism.
But he did excuse his frequent failure to engage in public worship by saying:

Denken ist auch Gottesdienst, 'Thinking too is service to God' .

stand in an ideal connection with each other' (PH, p. 410).

§377
The knowledge of mind is the most concrete knowledge, and thus the highest
and most difficult.1

Know thyself

The meaning of this absolute command­

whether in itself or in the historical circumstances of its first pronouncement - is
not only self-knowledge in respect of theparticular capacities, character, propensit­
ies, and foibles of the individual.2 The knowledge it commands is knowledge of
man's genuine reality, as well as of genuine reality in and for itself-of the vety

essence as

mind. Equally, the philosophy of mind too does not have the mean­

ing of so-called

understanding of human nature,

an understanding that likewise

endeavours to explore the particularities, passions, and foibles of other men, those
so-called recesses of the human hean. For one thing, understanding of this son
makes sense only if we presuppose knowledge of the

universal,

man

as

such and

thus essentially mind. And for another, it concerns itself with contingent, insig­
nificant, and untrue existences of the mental, but does not penetrate to what is
substantial, the mind itself )
Zusatz. The difficulty of the philosophical cognition of mind consists in the fact
that here we are no longer dealing with the comparatively abstract, simple logical
Idea, but with the most concrete, most developed form achieved by the Idea in its
self-actualization. Even finite or subjective mind, not only absolute mind, must
be grasped as an actualization of the Idea. The treatment of mind is only truly
philosophical when it cognizes the concept of mind in its living development and
actualization, i.e. j ust when it comprehends the mind as a copy of the eternal
Idea.4 But it belongs to the nature of mind to cognize its concept. Consequently,
the summons to self-knowledge, issued to the Greeks by the Delphic Apollo, does
not have the sense of a command externally addressed to the human mind by an
alien power; on the contraty, the god who impels to self-knowledge is none other
than the mind's own absolute law. All activity of the mind is, therefore, only an
apprehension of itself, and the aim of all genuine science is just this, that mind
shall recognize itself in everything in heaven and on earth. There is simply no out­
and-out Other for the mind.s Even the oriental does not wholly lose himself in
the object of his worship. But the Greeks were the first to grasp expressly as mind
that which they opposed to themselves as the Divine, though even they did not
attain, either in philosophy or in religion, to knowledge of the absolute infinity
of mind; therefore with the Greeks the relationship of the human mind to the
Divine is still not one of absolute freedom. It was Christianity, by the doctrine
of the incarnation of God and the presence of the Holy Spirit in the community
of believers, that first gave to human consciousness a perfectly free relation to
the infinite and thereby made possible the conceptual knowledge of mind in its
absolute infinity.6

Hegel's Philosophy ofMind

Henceforth, such a knowledge alone merits the name of a philosophical treat­
ment.

Selfknowledge in

the usual trivial sense of an inquiry into the individu­

al's own foibles and faults has interest and importance only tor the individual,
not for philosophy; but even in relation to the individual, the less it deals with
knowledge of the universal intellectual and moral nature of man, and the more
it degenerates-disregarding duties, the genuine content of the will-into a
self-satisfied absorption of the individual in the idiosyncrasies dear to him, the
less value that self-knowledge has. The same is true of the so-called

ing ofhuman nature which

understand­

is likewise directed to the peculiarities of individual

minds. For life this understanding is, of course, useful and necessary, especially
in bad political conditions where the obstinacy, caprice and wilfulness of indi­
viduals reign, not right and ethics,-in the field of intrigues where characters
do not rely on the nature of the cause but hold their own by smartly exploit­
ing the peculiarity of others and seek by this means to attain their contingent
ends. For philosophy, however, this understanding of human nature is a matter
of indifference to the extent that it is incapable of rising above the consider­
ation of contingent details to the apprehension of great human characters, by
which the genuine nature of man is presented to our vision in undimmed purity.
But this understanding of human nature can even become harmful for science
if, as happened in the so-called pragmatic treatment of history, through fail­
ure to appreciate the substantial character of world-historical individuals and
to see that great things can only be accomplished through great characters, it
makes the supposedly ingenious attempt to derive the greatest events of his­
tory from the contingent peculiarity of those heroes, from their presumed petty
intentions, inclinations and passions. In such a procedure history, which is ruled
by divine Providence, is reduced to a play of pointless activity and contingent
occurrences. 7

Pneumatology or the

has as its object the

mind and, after the revival of the sciences, when

observation and experience had become the principal foundation for knowledge
of concrete reality, such psychology was pursued in the same way. Consequently
the metaphysical element was kept outside this empirical science, and so pre­
vented from getting any concrete determination or content, while the empirical
science clung to the conventional intellectual metaphysics of forces, various activ­
ities, etc., and banished the speculative approach. 2

Aristotle 's

books

on the soul,

along with his essays on particular aspects and

states of the soul, are for this reason still the most admirable, perhaps even the
sole, work of speculative interest on this topic.3 The essential aim of a philosophy

of mind can only be to introduce the concept again into the knowledge of mind,
and so also to disclose once more the sense of those Aristotelian books. 4

Zusatz.

Genuinely speculative philosophy,5 which excludes the approach dis­

cussed in the previous Paragraph which is directed to the unessential, individual,
empirical appearances of mind, also excludes the directly opposite approach of
so-called

rational psychology or

pneumatology, which deals only with abstractly

universal determinations, with the essence supposedly beneath appearances, the
in-itself of mind.6 For speculative philosophy may not take its objects, as some­
thing given, from representation / nor may it determine its objects by mere cat­
egories of the intellect, as rational psychology did when it posed the question
whether the mind or the soul is simple, immaterial, a substance. In these ques­
tions mind was treated as a thing; for these categories were here regarded, in
the general manner of the intellect, as inert, fixed; thus they are incapable of
expressing the nature of mind. Mind is not an inert entity but is rather what
is absolutely restless, pure activity, the negating or the ideality of every fixed
determination of the intellect, - not abstractly simple but, in its simplicity, at the
same time a distinguishing-of-itself-from-itself, - not an essence that is already
complete before its appearing, keeping to itself behind the mountain of appear­
ances, but truly actual only through the determinate forms of its necessary self­
revelation , - and not (as that psychology supposed) a soul-thing only externally
related to the body, but inwardly bound to the body through the unity of the
concept.8
In the middle, between observation directed to the contingent individuality
of mind and pneumatology concerned only with mind's essence behind appear­
ances, stands

empirical psychology

intent on the observation and description of

the particular faculties of mind. But this too does not get to the genuine unifica­
tion of the individual and the universal, to knowledge of the concretely universal
nature or the concept of mind, and therefore it, too, has no claim to the name of
genuinely speculative philosophy. Empirical psychology takes not only the mind
in general, but also the particular faculties into which it analyses it, from rep­
resentation as givens, without deriving these particularities from the concept of
mind and so proving the necessity that in mind there are just these faculties and
no others.9-With this defect of form there is necessarily linked the despiritu­
alization of the content. 10 If in the two modes of treatment already described,
the individual on the one hand, and the universal on the other, was taken as
something fixed by itself, empirical psychology too holds the particular forms
into which it dissects the mind to be fixed in their limitation, so that the mind
becomes a mere aggregate of independent forces, each of which only interacts
with the others, hence is only externally related to them. I I For though this psy­
chology also demands the production of a harmonious interconnexion between
the various mental forces- an oft-recurring catch-phrase on this topic, but one

Hegel's Philosophy ofMind

6

which is j ust as indefinite as 'perfection' used to be- this expresses only a unity
of mind which ought to be, not the original unity of mind, and still less does it
recognize the particularization to which the concept of mind, the unity of mind
that is in itself, progresses, as a necessary and rational particularization. This har­
monious imerconnexion remains, therefore, a vacuous idea which expresses itself
in high-sounding but empty phrases and remains powerless in face of the mental
forces presupposed as independent.I 2

§379
The self-feeling of the mind's living unity spontaneously resists the fragmentation
of the mind into differentfaculties, forces, or, what comes to the same thing,

ities,

represented as independent of each other.1 But the need for

activ­
comprehension

here is stimulated even more by the oppositions, which at once present them­
selves, between the mind's .freedom and the mind's determinism, of the free agency
of the soul in contrast to the bodiliness external to it, and again the intimate con­
nection between the two.2 In experience too the phenomena of animal magnetism
in particular have given, in recent times, a visible illustration of the

unity of the soul,

substantial

and of the power of its ideality. Before these phenomena, the

rigid distinctions of the intellect are thrown into disarray; and the necessity of
a speculative examination for the dissolution of the contradictions is displayed
more direccly.3

Zusatz. All

those finite conceptions of mind outlined in the two previous

Paragraphs have been ousted, partly by the vast transformation undergone by
philosophy in general in recent years, and partly, from the empirical side itself,
by the phenomena of animal magnetism which are a stumbling-block to finite
thinking.4

As regards the former, philosophy has left behind the finite viewpoint

of merely reflective thinking which, since Wolff, had become universal, and
also the Fichtean standstill at the so-called facts of consciousness,s and risen to
the conception of mind as the self-knowing, actual Idea, to the concept of the
living mind which, in a necessary manner, differentiates itself within itself and
returns out of its differences to unity with itself. But in doing this, philosophy
has not only overcome the abstractions prevalent in those finite conceptions of
mind, the merely individual, merely particular, and merely universal, reducing
them to moments of the concept which is their truth; it has also, instead
of externally describing the material it finds, vindicated as the only scientific
method the rigorous form of the necessary self-development of the content. In
contrast to the empirical sciences, where the material as given by experience is
taken up from outside and ordered by an already established universal rule and
brought into external interconnexion, speculative thinking has to demonstrate
each of its objects and the development of them in their absolute necessity. This
happens when each particular concept is derived from the self-producing and
self-actualizing universal concept or the logical Idea. Philosophy must therefore

Introduction

7

comprehend mind as a necessary development of the eternal Idea and must let
what constitutes the particular parts of the science of mind evolve purely from
the concept of mind. Just as in the living creature generally, everything is already
contained, in an ideal manner, in the germ and is brought forth by the germ
itself, not by an alien power, so too must all particular forms of the living mind
grow out of its concept as from their germ. Our thinking, which is propelled
by the concept, here remains entirely immanent in the object, which is likewise
propelled by the concept; we merely look on, as it were, at the object's own
development, not altering it by importing our subjective ideas and notions. The
concept needs no external stimulus for its actualization; its own nature involves
the contradiction of simplicity and difference, and therefore restlessly impels it
to actualize itself, to unfold into actuality the difference which, in the concept
itself, is present only in an ideal manner, i.e., in the contradictory form of
undifferentiatedness, and by this sublation of its simplicity as a defect, a one­
sidedness, to make itself actually the whole, of which initially it contains only the
possibility.6
But the concept is j ust as independent of our wilfulness in the conclusion of its
development as it is in the beginning and in the course of it. In a merely ratiocin­
ative approach the conclusion certainly appears more or less arbitrary; in philo­
sophical science, by contrast, the concept itself sets a limit to its self-development
by giving itself an actuality that completely corresponds to it. Even in the liv­
ing thing we see this self-limitation of the concept. The germ of the plant, this
sensuously present concept, closes its development with an actuality like itself,
with production of the seed. The same is true of mind; its development, too, has
achieved its goal when the concept of mind has completely actualized itself or,
what is the same thing, when mind has attained to complete consciousness of its
concept. But this self-contraction-into-one of the beginning with the end, this
coming-to-itself of the concept in its actualization, appears in mind in a still more
complete form than in the merely living thing; for whereas in the latter the seed
produced is not identical with the seed that produced it, in self-knowing mind
the product is one and the same as that which produces it. 7
Only when we consider mind in this process of the self-actualization of its
concept, do we know it in its truth (for truth j ust means agreement of the concept
with its actuality) . In its immediacy, mind is not yet true, has not yet made its
concept an object for itself, has not yet transformed what is present in it in an
immediate way, into something posited by itself, has not yet converted its actual­
ity into an actuality appropriate to its concept.8 The entire development of mind
is nothing but its self-elevation to its truth, and the so-called soul-forces have no
other meaning than to be the stages of this elevation. By this self-differentiation,
by this self-transformation, and by the restoration of its differences to the unity
of its concept, mind, as it is something true, is also something living, organ­
ic, systematic; and only by knowing this its nature is the science of mind like­
wise true, living, organic, systematic, -predicates that cannot be awarded either

Hegel's Philosophy ofMind

8

to rational or to empirical psychology, for the former makes mind into a dead
essence divorced from its actualization, while the latter kills the living mind by
tearing it asunder into a manifold of independent forces which is neither pro­
duced by the concept nor held together by it.

As

already remarked, animal magnetism has played a pan in ousting the

untrue, finite, merely intellectual conception of mind. That remarkable state has
had this effect especially with regard to the treatment of the natural aspect of
the mind. If the other states and natural determinations of mind, as well as its
conscious activities, can be understood, at least externally, by the intellect, and if
the intellect is able to grasp the external connection of cause and effect obtaining
both within itself and in finite things, the so-called natural course of things, yet,
on the other hand, intellect shows itself incapable of even just believing in the
phenomena of animal magnetism, because in these the bondage of mind to place
and time-which in the opinion of the intellect is thoroughly fixed-and to
the intellectual interconnexion of cause and effect, loses its meaning, and the
elevation of mind above asunderness and above its external connexions, which
to the intellect remains an unbelievable miracle, comes to light within sensory
realiry itself. Now although it would be very foolish to see in the phenomena
of animal magnetism an elevation of mind above even its conceptual reason,
and to expect from this state higher disclosures about the eternal than those
granted by philosophy, although the magnetic state must be declared a disease
and a decline of mind itself below ordinary consciousness, in so far as in that
state the mind surrenders its thinking, the thinking that proceeds in determinate
distinctions and contrasts itself with nature, yet, on the other hand, in the visible
liberation of mind in those magnetic phenomena from the limitations of space
and time and from all finite connexions, there is something that has an affiniry to
philosophy, something that, with all the brutality of an established fact, defies
the scepticism of the intellect and so necessitates the advance from ordinary
psychology to the conceptual cognition of speculative philosophy, for which
alone animal magnetism is not an incomprehensible miracle.9

§380
The

concrete nature of mind involves for the observer the peculiar difficulty that

the particular stages and determinations of the development of its concept do
not also remain behind as particular existences in contrast to its deeper forma­
tions. It is otherwise in external nature. There, matter and movement have a free
existence of their own in the solar system; the determinations of the
have a retrospective existence as properties of

bodies,

senses also

and still more freely as the

elements, etc. The determinations and stages of the mind, by contrast, are essen­
tially only moments, states, determinations in the higher stages of development.1

As a consequence of this,

a lower and more abstract determination of the mind

reveals the presence in it, even empirically, of a higher phase. In sensation, for

Introduction
example, we

can

9

find all the higher phases of the mind as its content or determ­

inacy. And so sensation, which is j ust an abstract form, may to the superficial
glance seem to be the essential seat and even the root of that higher content,
the religious, the ethical, and so on; and it may seem necessary to consider the
determinations of this content as panicular species of sensation. But all the same,
when lower stages are under consideration, it becomes necessary, in order to draw
attention to them in their empirical existence, to refer to higher stages in which
they are present only as forms. In this way we need at times to introduce, by anti­
cipation, a content which presents itself only later in the development (e.g. in
dealing with natural waking from sleep we speak, by anticipation, of conscious­
ness, in dealing with mental derangement we speak of intellect, etc.) .2

Concept of Mind

§381
For us mind has nature as its presupposition, though mind is the truth of nature,
and is thus absolutely first with respect to it.1 In this truth nature has vanished,
and mind has emerged as the Idea that has reached its being-for-self. The object
of the Idea as well as the subject is the concept. This identity is absolute negativ­
ity, since in nature the concept has its complete, external objectivity, but this
externalization of the concept has been sublated and the concept has, in this
externalization, become identical with itself. And so the concept is this identity
only so far as it is at the same time a return out of nature.2

Zusatz.

We have already indicated, in the

Zusatz to §379, the concept of mind,

saying that the mind is the self-knowing, actual Idea. Philosophy has to demon­
strate the necessity of this concept, as of all its other concepts, which means that
philosophy has to cognize it as the result of the development of the universal
concept or of the logical Idea. But in this development, mind is preceded not only
by the logical Idea but also by external nature. For the cognition already contained
in the simple

logical Idea is only the concept of cognition thought by us, not cog­

nition existing for itself, not actual mind but merely its possibility. Actual mind,
which in the science of mind is our only object, has external nature for its imme­
diate presupposition and the logical Idea as its first presupposition. Philosophy
of nature, and indirectly logic, must therefore have as its final result the proof
of the necessity of the concept of mind. The science of mind, on its pan, has to
authenticate this concept by developing and actualizing it. Accordingly, what we
say here assenively about mind at the beginning of our treatment of it,

can

only

be scientifically proved by philosophy in its entirety. All we can do initially is to
elucidate the concept of mind for representation.3
In order to establish what this concept is, we must indicate the determinacy by
which the Idea takes the form of mind. But every determinacy is a determinacy
only in contrast to another determinacy; the determinacy of mind in general

Hegel's Philosophy ofMind

10

stands in contrast initially to the determinacy of nature; the former is, therefore,

As the distinguishing determinacy
ideality, that is, the sublation of the

to be grasped only together with the latter.
of the concept of mind we must designate

otherness of the Idea, the Idea's returning, and its having returned, into itself from

simple
self-externality of the Idea. 4 A more
detailed development of what was said in passing in the Zusatz to §379 about the

its Other; whereas the distinctive feature of the logical Idea is immediate,

being-within-itself, while

for nature it is the

logical Idea, would involve too wide a digression here; more necessary at this point
is an elucidation of what has been indicated as the characteristic of external nature,
for it is to nature, as already remarked, that mind has its immediate relation.
External nature too, like mind, is rational, divine, a presentation of the Idea.
But in nature the Idea appears in the element of asunderness, is external not
only to mind but also to itself, precisely because it is external to the inward­
ness that is in and for itself and which constitutes the essence of mind. This
concept of nature, already enunciated by the Greeks and entirely familiar to
them, is in complete agreement with our ordinary idea of nature. 5 We know
that what is natural is spatial and temporal, that in nature this stands next to
that, this follows after that, in brief, that everything natural is mutually external,
ad infinitum; further, that matter, this universal foundation of all formations to
be found in nature, not only offers resistance to us, subsists outside our mind,
but holds itself asunder against its own self, divides itself into concrete points,
into material atoms, of which it is composed. The differences into which the
concept of nature unfolds are more or less mutually independent existences; of
course, through their original uniry they stand in mutual relation, so that none
can

be comprehended without the others; but this relation is in a greater or less

degree external to them. We rightly say, therefore, that not freedom but neces­
siry reigns in nature; for necessiry in its strictest meaning is precisely the merely
internal, and for that reason also merely external, relation of mutually independ­
ent existences. Thus, for example, light and the elements appear as mutually
independent; similarly the planets, though attracted by the sun and despite this
relationship to their centre, have the semblance of independence with respect to
it and to one another, this contradiction is displayed by the motion of the planet
round the sun.6-ln the living creature, of course, there emerges a higher neces­
siry than that which holds sway in lifeless things. Even in the plant, we see a
centre which has overflowed into the periphery, a concentration of the differ­
ences, a self-development-from-within-outwards, a uniry that differentiates itself
and from its differences produces itself in the bud, something, therefore, to which
we attribute an urge; but this uniry remains incomplete because the plant's pro­
cess of articulating itself is a coming� forth-from-self of the vegetable subject, each
part is the whole plant, a repetition of it, and consequently the members are not
held in complete subjection to the uniry of the subject.? -An even more com­
plete overcoming of externaliry is exhibited in the animal organism; in this not
only does each member generate the other, is its cause and effect, means and end,

Introduction

so that it is at the same time its Other, but the whole is so pervaded by its unity
that nothing in it appears as independent, every determinacy is at once an ideal
determinacy, the animal remaining in every determinacy the same single univer­

sal, so that in the animal body the complete untruth of asunderness is exposed.
Through this being-together-with-itself in the determinacy, through this imme­
diate reflectedness into itself in and out of its externality, the animal is subjectivity
that is for itself and has sensation; sensation is just this omnipresence of the unity
of the animal in all its members, which immediately communicate every impres­
sion to the single whole which, in the animal, is beginning to become for itself.
It is because of this subjective inwardness, that the animal is determined through
itself, from within outwards, not merely from outside, that is to say, it has urge
and instinct.8 The subjectivity of the animal contains a contradiction and the
urge to preserve itself by sublating this contradiction; this self-preservation is the
privilege of the living thing and, in a still higher degree, of mind. The sentient
creature is determinate, has a content, and thus a differentiation within itself;
this difference is initially still a wholly ideal difference, simple, sublated in the
unity of sensation; the sublated difference subsisting in the unity is a contradic­
tion which is sublated by the fact that the difference posits itself as difference.
The animal is, therefore, driven otit of its simple self-relation into opposition to
external nature.9 By this opposition the animal falls into a new contradiction, for
the difference is now posited in a way that contradicts the unity of the concept;
accordingly this difference too must be sublated, like the initial undifferentiated
unity. This sublation of the difference comes about owing to the animal's con­
suming what is determined for it in external nature and preserving itself by what
it consumes.10 Thus by the annihilation of the Other confronting the animal, the
original simple relation to itself and the contradiction contained in it is posited
once more. For a genuine resolution of this contradiction the Other, with which
the animal enters into relationship, needs to be similar to the animal. This occurs
in the

sexual relationship;

here, each of the two sexes senses in the Other not an

alien externality but its own self, or the genus common to them both. The sexual
relationship is, therefore, the highest point ofliving nature; at this stage, nature is
exempt in the fullest measure from external necessity, since the distinct existences
related to each other are no longer external to each other but have the sensation
of their unity.l l Yet the animal soul is still not free, for it always appears as one
with the determinacy of the sensation or excitation, as bound to one determinacy;
it is only in the form of individuality that the genus is for the animal. The animal
only senses the genus, it is not aware of it; in the animal, the soul is not yet for the

soul,

the universal as such is not for the universal. By the sublation of the partic­

ularity of the sexes which occurs in the genus-process, the animal does not attain
to the production of the genus; what is produced by this process is again only an
individual. Thus nature, even at the highest point of its elevation above finitude,
always falls back into it again and in this way exhibits a perpetual cycle. 12 Death

Hegel's Philosophy ofMind

12

necessarily results from the contradiction between individuality and the genus,
but since it is not the preserving sublation of individuality, only the empty, anni­
hilating negation of it, itself appearing in the form of immediate individuality,
death likewise does not produce the universality that is in and for itself, or the
individuality that is universal in and for itself, the subjectivity that has itself as its
object .B Therefore, even in the most perfect form to which nature raises itself,
in animal life, the concept does not attain to an actuality resembling its soulful
essence, to the complete overcoming of the externality and finitude of its embod­
ied reality. This first happens in the

mind,

which, precisely by this overcoming

accomplished in it, distinguishes itself from nature, so that this distinguishing is
not merely the doing of an external reflection on the essence of mind.
This sublation of externality belonging to the concept of mind, is what we have
called the

ideality of mind. All activities of mind are nothing but various ways of

reducing what is external to the inwardness which mind itself is, and it is only
by this reduction, by this idealization or assimilation of the external that mind
becomes and is mind.14- If we consider mind more closely, we find that the first
and simplest determination of it is that it is I. I is something perfectly simple,
universal. When we say /, we indeed mean an individual; but since everyone is I,
we thereby say only something entirely universal. The universality of the I enables
it to abstract from everything, even from its life. But the mind is not merely this
abstractly simple counterpart to light, which is how it was regarded when they
talked about the simplicity of the soul in contrast to the complexity of the body;
on the contrary, in spite of its simplicity the mind is differentiated within itself,
for I posits itself over against itself, makes itself its own object and returns from
this difference, which is, of course, at first abstract, not yet concrete difference,
to unity with itself. This being-together-with-itself of the I in its differentiation
is the infinity or ideality of the I. But this ideality authenticates itself only in the
relation of the I to the infinitely manifold material confronting it. When the I
grasps it, this material is at once poisoned and transfigured by the universality
of the I, loses its individualized, independent subsistence and receives a spir­
itual reality. The mind is therefore far from being forced out of its simplicity,
its being-together-with-itself, by the infinite multiplicity of its representations,
into a spatial asunderness; on the contrary, its simple self, in undimmed clar­
ity, pervades this multiplicity through and through and does not let it reach an
independent subsistence.15
But mind is not content to remain finite mind, transposing things by its rep­
resentational activity into the space of its inwardness and thus stripping them of
their externality in a manner that is itself still external;16 on the contrary, as

gious consciousness,

reli­

it pierces through the seemingly absolute independence of

things to the one, infinite power of God at work in their interior and holding
everything together; and as philosophical thinking, it completes this idealization
of things by cognizing the determinate way in which the eternal Idea forming

Introduction

13

their common principle displays itself in them. Through this cognition, the ideal­
istic nature of mind which is already operative in finite mind, attains its com­
pleted, most concrete shape, mind makes itself into the actual Idea that perfectly
apprehends itself and hence into absolute mindP Already in finite mind, ideality
has the meaning of a movement returning to its beginning; by this movement the
mind, advancing from its undifferentiatedness, as the first position, to an Other,
to the negation of that position, and by means of the negation of this negation
returning to itself, proves to be absolute negativity, infinite self-affirmation; and
we have to consider finite mind, conformably to this its nature, first, in its imme­
diate unity with nature, then in its opposition to nature, and lastly, in its unity
with nature, a unity which contains within itself that opposition as a sublated
opposition and is mediated by it. Thus conceived, finite mind is recognised as
totality, as Idea, and in fact as the actual Idea which is for itself, which returns
to itself out of that opposition. But in finite mind there is only the beginning of
this return; it is completed only in absolute mind; for only in absolute mind does
the Idea apprehend itself, not merely in the one-sided form of the concept or sub­
jectivity, nor merely in the equally one-sided form of objectivity or actuality, but
in the perfect unity of these its distinct moments, that is, in its absolute truth.18
What we have said above about the nature of mind is something which philo­
sophy alone can and does demonstrate; it does not need to be confirmed by
our ordinary consciousness. But in so far as our non-philosophical thinking,
on its part, needs the developed concept of mind to be made accessible to rep­
resentation, we can point out that Christian theology, too, conceives God, i.e.
the truth, as mind and regards mind not as something quiescent, remaining
in empty uniformity, but as something which necessarily enters into the pro­
cess of distinguishing itself from itself, of positing its Other, and which comes
to itself only through this Other, and by the preserving sublation of this Oth­
er- not by abandoning it. Theology, as we know, expresses this process in the
manner of representation by saying that God the Father (this simple univer­
sal, being-within-itself) , giving up his solitude, creates nature (the self-external,

being-outside-itself) , begets a son (his other 1), but by virtue of his infinite love
beholds himself in this Other, recognizes his image therein and in it returns to
unity with himself; this unity is no longer abstract, immediate unity, but a con­
crete unity mediated by difference; it is the Holy Spirit which proceeds from the
Father and from the Son, reaching its complete actuality and truth in the Chris­
tian community; God must be known as the Holy Spirit if he is to be conceived
in his absolute truth, conceived as the Idea that is actual in and for itself, and
not j ust in the form of the mere concept, of abstract being-within-self, nor in the
equally untrue form of an individual actuality in disagreement with the universal­
ity of its concept, but in the full agreement of his concept and his actuality.19
So much for the distinctive determinacies of external nature and of mind in
general. The development of the difference has at the same time indicated the
relation in which nature and mind stand to each other. Since this relation is often

14

Hegel's Philosophy ofMind

misunderstood, this is the appropriate place for an elucidation of it. We have said
that mind negates the externality of nature, assimilates nature to itself and thereby
idealizes it. In finite mind, which posits nature outside itself, this idealization has
a one-sided form; here the activity of our willing, as of our thinking, is confronted
by an external material which is indifferent to the alteration we carry out on it

and undergoes the idealization conferred on it with complete passivity.2 o But
a different relationship obtains in the case of the mind that produces world­
history.Here, there no longer stands, on the one side, an activity external to the
object, and on the other side, a merely passive object; the spiritual activity is
directed towards an object which is active within itself, an object that has itself
worked its way up to the result to be brought about by that activity, so that in
the activity and in the object one and the same content is present. Thus, for
example, the people and the time on which the activity of Alexander and Caesar
operated as their object, had by their own effons become capable of the work to
be accomplished by those individuals; the time created these men for itself just as
much as it was created by them; they were as much the instruments of the spirit
of their time and their people, as conversely their people served these heroes as an
instrument for the accomplishment of their deeds.21 - Similar to the relationship
just outlined is the way in which the philosophizing mind approaches external
nature. That is to say, philosophical thinking knows that nature is idealized not
merely by us, that nature's asunderness is not an entirely insuperable limitation
for nature itself, for its concept, but that the eternal Idea immanent in nature or,
what is the same thing, the implicit mind at work in the interior of nature itself
effects the idealization, the sublation of asunderness, because this form of mind's
realization stands in contradiction with the inwardness of its essence. Therefore
philosophy has, as it were, only to watch and see how nature itself sublates its
externality, how it takes back what is self-external into the centre of the Idea, or
lets this centre emerge in the external, how it liberates the concept concealed in
nature from the covering of externality and thereby overcomes external necessity.
This transition from necessity to freedom is not a simple transition but a gradual
progression of many moments, whose exposition constitutes the philosophy of
nature. At the highest stage of this sublation of asunderness, in sensation, the
implicit mind held captive in nature reaches the beginning of being-for-self and
and thus of freedom. By this being-for-self which is itself still burdened with the
form of individuality and externality, consequently also with unfreedom, nature
is driven onwards beyond itself to mind as such, that is, to the mind which, by
thinking, is for itself in the form of universality and actually free.22
But it is already evident from our discussion so far that the emergence of mind
from nature must not be conceived as if nature were the absolutely immediate,
the first, the original positing agent, while mind, by contrast, were only some­
thing posited by nature; it is rather nature that is posited by mind, and mind is
what is absolutely first. Mind that is in and for itself is not the mere result of
nature, but is in truth its own result; it brings itself fonh from the presuppositions

Introduction

15

that it makes for itself, from the logical Idea and external nature, and is the truth
of the logical Idea as well as of nature, i.e. the true shape of the mind that is
only within itself, and of the mind that is only outside itself. The semblance of
mind's being mediated by an Other is sublated by mind itself, since mind has, so
to speak, the sovereign ingratitude of sublating, of mediatizing, that by which it
seems to be mediated, of reducing it to something subsisting only through mind
and in this way making itself completely independent.23-What we have said
already implies that the transition of nature to mind is not a transition to an
out-and-out Other, but is only a coming-to-itself of the mind that is outside
itself in nature. But equally, the determinate difference of nature and mind is
not sublated by this transition; for mind does not emerge in a natural manner
from nature. When we said in §222 that the death of the merely immediate, indi­
vidual form of life is the emergence of mind, this emergence is not in the flesh
but spiritual, it is not to be understood as a natural emergence but as a devel­
opment of the concept, the concept that sublates the one-sidedness of the genus
which does not reach adequate actualization, proving in death to be rather the
negative power opposed to that actuality, and also sublates the opposite one­
sidedness of the animal reality bound to individuality; both one-sidednesses are
sublated in the individuality which is in and for itself universal or, what is the
same thing, in the universal which is for itself in a universal manner, the universal
that is mind. 24

Nature as such in its self-internalizing does not attain to this being-for-self, to

the consciousness of itself; the animal, the most complete form of this intern­
alization, exhibits only the spiritless dialectic of transition from one individual
sensation filling up its whole soul to another individual sensation which equally
exclusively dominates it; it is man who first raises himself above the individuality
of sensation to the universality of thought, to awareness of himself, to the grasp of
his subjectivity, of his 1-in a word, it is only man who is thinking mind and by
this, and by this alone, is essentially distinguished from nature. What belongs to
nature as such lies behind the mind; it is true that mind has within itself the entire
content of nature, but the determinations of nature are in the mind in a radically
different way from that in which they are in external nature. 25

§382
For this reason formally the essence of mind is freedom, the concept's absolute neg­
ativity as identity with itself. In accordance with this formal determination, the
mind

can

abstract from everything external and from its own externality, from

its very life; it
i.e. it

can

can

endure the negation of its individual immediacy, infinite pain,

maintain itself affirmatively in this negativity and be identical for itself.

This possibility is its intrinsic abstract universality, a universality that is for itself. 1

Zusatz. The substance of mind is freedom, i.e. not being dependent on an Other,
the relating of itself to itself. Mind is the actualized concept which is for itself

Hegel's Philosophy ofMind

16

and has itself for its object. Its truth and its freedom alike consist in this unity of
concept and objectivity present in it. The truth, as Christ has already said, makes
mind free; freedom makes it true.2 But the freedom of mind is not merely an
independence of the Other won outside the Other, but won within the Other;
it attains actuality not by fleeing from the Other but by overcoming it. Mind
can

step out of its abstract universality, a universality that is for itself, out of

its simple self-relation, can posit within itself a determinate, actual difference,
something other than the simple I, and hence a negative; and this relation to
the Other is, for mind, not merely possible but necessary, because it is through
the Other and by sublation of it, that mind comes to authenticate itself as, and
in fact comes to be, what it ought to be according to its concept, namely, the
ideality of the external, the Idea that returns to itself out of its otherness, or,
expressed more abstractly, the self-differentiating universal which in its differ­
ence is together with itself and for itself.3 The Other, the negative, contradiction,
rupture, thus belongs to the nature of mind. In this rupture lies the possibility of

pain.

Pain has therefore not come to the mind from outside, as people imagined

when they posed the question about the way in which pain came into the world.4
Nor does

evil,

the negative of the infinite mind that is in and for itself, come to

the mind from outside, any more than pain does; on the contrary, evil is nothing
other than the mind taking its stand at the summit of its individuality. There­
fore, even in this its extreme rupture, in this breaking loose from the root of its
implicitly ethical nature, in this uttermost contradiction with itself, the mind yet
remains identical with itself and therefore free.5 What belongs to external nature
is destroyed by contradiction; if, for example, gold were given a different specific
gravity from what it has, it would have to perish as gold. But mind has the power
to preserve itself in contradiction and, therefore, in pain (pain aroused by evil,
as well as by the disagreeable) . Ordinary logic is, therefore, in error in supposing
that mind is something that completely excludes contradiction from itself. On
the contrary, all consciousness contains a unity and a separation, hence a contra­
diction. Thus, for example, the representation of house is something completely
contradictory to my I and yet endured by it. But contradiction is endured by
mind, because mind contains no determination that it does not recognize as a
determination posited by itself and consequently as a determination that it can
also sublate again. This power over all the content present in it forms the basis
of the freedom of mind.6 But in its immediacy, mind is free only implicitly, in
concept or possibility, not yet in actuality; actual freedom is thus not something
that is immediately in the mind but something to be produced by mind's activ­
ity. So in science we have to regard mind as the producer of its freedom. The
entire development of the concept of mind displays only mind's freeing of itself
from all the forms of its reality which do not correspond to its concept: a liber­
ation which comes about by the transformation of these forms into an actuality
perfectly adequate to the concept of mind.?

Introduction

17

§383
This universality is also its

reality. As it is for itself, the universal is self-particular­

izing, while still remaining self-identity.1 Therefore the determinacy of mind is

manifestation.

The mind is not some one determinacy or content whose expres­

sion or externality is only a form distinct from the mind itself. Hence it does not
reveal something; its determinacy and content is this very revelation. Its possibility
is therefore immediately infinite, absolute actuality. 2

Zusatz.

Earlier, we posited the distinctive determinacy of mind in

ideality,

in

sublation of the otherness of the Idea. If now, in §383 above, 'manifestation' is
given as the determinacy of mind, this is not a new, not a second, determination
of mind, but only a development of the determination discussed earlier. For by
sublation of its otherness, the logical Idea, or the mind that is in itself, becomes
for itself, in other words, revealed to itself.3 Mind which is for itself, or mind
as such- in contrast to mind which is in itself, unknown to itself, revealed
only to us, poured out into the asunderness of nature- is, therefore, that which
reveals itself not merely to an Other but to itself, or, what amounts to the same
thing, that which accomplishes its revelation in its own element, not in an alien
material. This determination pertains to mind as such; it holds true therefore
of mind not only in so far as mind relates itself simply to itself, is an I having
itself as object, but also in so far as mind steps out of its abstract universality,
the universality that is for itself, and posits within itself a determinate distinc­
tion, something other than itself; for the mind does not lose itself in this Other,
but, on the contrary, preserves and actualizes itself in it, impresses on it the
mind's own interior, makes the Other into a reality corresponding to mind, and
so by this sublation of the Other, of the determinate, actual difference, comes
to concrete being-for-self, to determinate revelation to itself.4 In the Other,
therefore, mind reveals only itself, its own nature; but its nature consists in self­
revelation. The revelation of itself to itself is therefore the very content of mind
and not, as it were, only a form externally added to its content; consequently
mind, by its revelation, does not reveal a content different from its form, but
reveals its form, the form expressing the entire content of mind, namely, its
self-revelation. In mind, therefore, form and content are identical with each
other. 5 Of course, revelation is usually represented as an empty form which still
requires the addition a content from outside; and by content is understood a
being-within-itself, something keeping-within-itself, and by form, on the other
hand, the external manner of the relation of the content to an Other. But in
speculative logic it is demonstrated that, in truth, the content is not merely a
being-within-itself, but something which spontaneously enters into relation with
an Other; just as, conversely, in truth, the form must be grasped not merely as
something dependent, external to the content, but rather as that which makes the
content into the content, into a being�within-itself, into something distinct from

Hegel's Philosophy ofMind

18

an Other. The genuine content contains, therefore, form within itself, and the
genuine form is its own content. But we have to get to know mind as this genuine
content and as this genuine form.6 -ln order to explain for representation this
unity of form and content present in mind, the unity of revelation and what is
revealed, we

can

refer to the teaching of the Christian religion. Christianity says:

God has revealed himself through Christ, his only begotten Son. Representation
initially takes this statement to mean that Christ is only the instrument of this
revelation, that what is revealed in this manner is something other than what
reveals it. But, in truth, the statement rather has this sense: God has revealed that
his nature consists in having a Son, i.e. in differentiating himself, making himself
finite, but in his difference remaining together with himself, beholding himself
and revealing himself in the Son, and by this unity with the Son, by this being­
for-himself in the Other, he is absolute mind, so that the Son is not the mere
instrument of the revelation but is himself the content of the revelation.?
Just as mind displays the unity of form and content, it is also the unity of
possibility and actuality. By the possible in general we understand what is still
inward, what has not yet come to expression, to revelation. But now we have seen
that mind as such only is, in so far as it reveals itself to itself. Actuality, which
consists just in mind's revelation, therefore belongs to its concept. In finite mind
the concept of mind does not, of course, yet reach its absolute actualization; but
absolute mind is the absolute unity of the actuality of mind and the concept or
possibility of mind.s

§384
Revelation, as the revelation of the abstract Idea, is the unmediated transition, the
becoming, of nature.l As the revelation of mind, which is free, it is the positing of
nature as its world; but because this positing is reflection, it is at the same time
the presupposition of the world as independent nature.2 Revelation in the concept
is creation of nature as its being, in which the mind procures the affirmation and
truth of its freedom.3
[Remark] The absolute is mind. This is the highest definition of the absolute. To
find this definition and to comprehend its meaning and content was, we may
say, the absolute tendency of all culture and philosophy; it was the point towards
which all religion and science pressed on; only this impetus enables us to com­
prehend the history of the world.- The word 'mind' , and the

representation of

mind, were found early on, and the contep.t of the Christian religion is to make
God known as mind. It is the task of philosophy to grasp in its own element,
the concept, what is here given to representation and what is

in itself the essence.

That problem is not genuinely and immanently solved until freedom and the
concept become the object and the soul of philosophy.4

Zusatz. Self-revelation is a determination penaining to mind in general; but it has
three distinct forms. The first way in which mind that is in itself, or the logical

Introduction

19

Idea, reveals itself, consists in the transformation of the Idea into the immediacy
of external and individualized reality. This transformation is the coming-to-be
of nature. Nature, too, is something posited; but its positedness has the form of
immediacy, of being outside the Idea. This form contradicts the inwardness of
the self-positing Idea which brings itself forth from its presuppositions. The Idea,
or mind that is in itself, slumbering in nature, sublates, therefore, the external­
ity, individualization, and immediacy of nature, creates for itself a reality con­
formable to its inwardness and universality and thereby becomes mind that is
reflected into itself and is for itself, self-conscious and awakened mind or mind as
such . 5 -This gives the

second form of mind's revelation. At this stage

mind, no

longer poured out into the asunderness of nature, sets itself, as what is for itself,
revealed to itself, in opposition to unconscious nature, which conceals mind as
much as reveals it. Mind makes nature into its object, reflects on it, takes back
the externality of nature into its own inwardness, idealizes nature and thus in
its object becomes for itself. But this first being-for-self of mind is itself still an
immediate, abstract, not an absolute being-for-self; the self-externality of mind is
not absolutely sublated by it. The awakening mind does not yet recognize here
its unity with the mind that is in itself, hidden in nature, it stands, therefore, in
external relation to nature, it does not appear as all in all, but only as one side of
the relationship; it is true that in its relationship to the Other it is also reflected
into itself and so is self-consciousness, but it lets this unity of consciousness and
self-consciousness still subsist as a unity that is so external, empty and superfi­
cial that at the same time self-consciousness and consciousness still fall asunder,
and mind, despite its being-together-with-itself, is at the same time together not
with itself but with an Other, and its unity with the mind that is in itself and
active within the Other does not as yet become for mind. Here, mind posits
nature as something reflected-into-itself, as its world, strips nature of its form
of an Other confronting it and makes the Other opposing it into something pos­
ited by mind itself; but, at the same time, this Other still remains independent
of mind, something immediately present, not posited but only presupposed by
mind, something, therefore, the positing of which precedes reflective thinking.
Hence at this standpoint the positedness of nature by mind is not yet absolute
but comes about only in reflective consciousness; nature is, therefore, not yet
comprehended as subsisting only through infinite mind, as its creation. Here,
consequently, mind still has in nature a limitation and by this very limitation is
finite mind.6- Now this limitation is sublated by absolute knowledge, which is
the

third and highest revelation of mind. At this stage the dualism disappears, of,

on the one hand, a self-subsistent nature or mind poured out into asunderness,
and, on the other hand, the mind that is first beginning to become for itself but
does not yet comprehend its unity with the mind in nature. Absolute mind recog­
nises itself as positing being itself, as itself producing its Other, nature and finite
mind, so that this Other loses all semblance of independence in face of mind,
ceases altogether to be a limitation for mind and appears only as the means by

Hegel's Philosophy ofMind

20

which mind attains to absolute being-for-itself, to the absolute unity of its being­
in-itself and its being-for-itself, of its concept and its actuality.?
The highest definition of the Absolute is this: it is not merely mind in gener­
al, it is mind absolutely revealed to itself, self-conscious, infinitely creative mind,
which we have j ust characterized as the third form of its revelation.8 Just as in sci­
ence we progress from the imperfect forms of mind's revelation delineated above
to the highest form of its revelation, so, too, world-histoty exhibits a series of
conceptions of the eternal, only at the conclusion of which does the concept
of absolute mind emerge. Oriental religions, and the judaic religion too, stop
short at the still abstract concept of God and of mind, as is done even by the
Enlightenment which wants to know only of God the Father; for God the Fath­
er, by himself, is the self-enclosed, the abstract, therefore not yet the spiritual
God, not yet the genuine God . In Greek religion God did, of course, begin to be
revealed in a determinate manner. The portrayal of the Greek gods had beauty
for its law, nature raised to the level of mind. The beautiful does not remain
something abstractly ideal, but in its ideality it is at once perfectly determinate,
individualized. The Greek gods are, however, initially only displayed for sensory
intuition or for representation, they are not yet grasped in thought. But the sens­
ory medium can only exhibit the totality of mind as an asunderness, as a circle of
individual spiritual shapes; the unity embracing all these shapes remains, there­
fore, a wholly indeterminate, alien power over against the gods. The one nature
of God, differentiated within itself, the totality of the divine mind in the form
of unity, has first been revealed by the Christian religion. This content, given in
the mode of representation, has to be raised by philosophy into the form of the
concept or of absolute knowledge, which, as we have said, is the highest revela­
tion of that content.9

Subdivision

§385
The development of mind is as follows:

I. In the form of relation to its own self: it has the ideal totality of the Idea
arise within it, i.e. what its concept is comes before it and its being is to be
together with itself, i.e. free. This is subjective mind.

11. In the form of reality, as a world produced and to be produced by it; in this
world freedom is present as necessity. This is objective mind.

Ill. In the unity of the objectivity of mind and of its ideality or concept, a
unity that is in andfor itselfand eternally produces itself, mind in its abso­
lute truth. This is absolute mind. 1

Zusatz. Mind is always

Idea; but initially it is only the

concept of the Idea,

or the

Idea in its indeterminacy, in the most abstract mode of reality, i.e. in the mode of
being. In the beginning we have only the wholly universal, undeveloped determ­
ination of mind, not yet its particularity; this we obtain only when we pass from

21

Introduction

one thing to something else, for the particular contains a One and an Other; but
it is j ust at the beginning that we have not yet made this transition. The reality
of mind is, therefore, initially still a wholly universal, not particularized reality;
the development of this reality will be completed only by the entire philosophy
of mind.2 The still entirely abstract, immediate reality is, however, the natural,
the unspiritual. For this reason the child is still caught up in naturalness, has only
natural urges, is a spiritual human being not yet in actuality but only in poten­
tiality or the concept.3 Accordingly, we must characterize the first reality of the
concept of mind as the most inappropriate for mind, simply because it is still
an abstract, immediate reality belonging to naturalness; but the genuine reality
must be determined as the totality of the developed moments of the concept, the
concept that remains the soul, the unity of these moments. The concept of mind
necessarily advances to this development of its reality, for the form of immedi­
acy, of indeterminacy, which its reality initially has, is a form in contradiction
with the concept; what seems to be immediately present in the mind is not any­
thing genuinely immediate, but is in itself something posited, mediated. Mind
is impelled by this contradiction to sublate the immediate, the Other, the form,
that is, in which it presupposes itself. By this sublation it first comes to itself,
first emerges

as

mind. Consequently, we cannot begin with mind as such, but

must start from its most inappropriate reality.4 Mind, it is true,

is already mind

at the beginning, but it does not yet know that it is. It is not mind itself that,
at the beginning, has already grasped its concept: it is only we, we who contem­
plate it, who know its concept. That mind comes to a knowledge of what it is,
this constitutes its realization. Mind is essentially only what it knows itself to be.
Initially, it is only mind in itself; its becoming-for-itself forms its actualization.
But it becomes for itself only by particularizing, determining itself, or making
itself into its presupposition, into the Other of itself, initially relating itself to this
Other as to its immediacy, but sublating it as Other.S As long as mind stands in
relation to itself as to an Other, it is only subjective mind, coming from nature and
itself initially natural mind. But the entire activity of subjective mind is directed
to grasping itself as itself, to proving itself to be the ideality of its immediate real­
ity. When it has attained to being-for-itself, then it is no longer merely subjective,
but

objective mind.

Whereas subjective mind, owing its relation to an Other, is

still unfree or, what is the same thing, is free only

in itself in objective mind free­

dom, mind's knowledge of itself as free, comes to realization.6 Objective mind is
a person, and as such has a reality of its freedom in property; for in property the
thing is posited as what it is, namely, as something lacking independence and as
something that essentially has only the meaning of being the reality of the free
will of a person and, for that reason, of being for any other person something
inviolable. Here we see a subjective entity that is aware of itself as free, and, at
the same time, an external reality of this freedom; here, therefore, mind attains to
being-for-itself, the objectivity of mind receives its due. Thus mind has emerged
from the form of mere subjectivity. But the full actualization of this freedom

which in property is still incomplete, still formal, the completion of the realiz­
ation of the concept of objective mind is achieved only in the political state, in
which mind develops its freedom into a world posited by mind, into the ethical
world.? Yet mind must pass beyond this stage too. The defect of this objectivity
of mind consists in its being only a posited objectivity. Mind must again freely let
go the world, what mind has posited must at the same time be grasped as having
an immediate being. This happens at the third stage of mind, at the standpoint of
absolute mind, i.e. of art, religion, and philosophy. 8

three stages-finding a world before it as a presupposed world, generating a world

place, in the Logic. Logic then goes on to show in the case of the more determ­

shows for the concrete forms of finitude, j ust this: that the finite is not, i.e. is not

the previous spheres is the dialectic in which it meets its end at the hands of an

Other and in an Other; but mind, the concept and what is in itselfeternal, is itself
the accomplishment within itself of the nullification of the null and the reduction
of the vain to vanity. The above-mentioned modesty is attachment to this van­
ity, the finite, in opposition to the true; it is itself therefore vanity. This vanity
will emerge in the development of the mind itself as the mind's extreme immer­
sion in its subjectivity and its innermost contradiction and thus its turning point,
as evil.4

Introduction
Zusatz.

Subjective and objective mind are still finite. But it is necessary to know

what sense the finirude of mind has. This is usually represented as an absolute
limitation, as a fixed quality, by the removal of which the mind would cease to
be mind; j ust as the essence of natural things is tied to a determinate quality,
as, for example, gold cannot be separated from its specific gravity, this or that
animal cannot be without claws, incisors, etc.5 But in truth, the finitude of mind
must not be regarded as a fixed determination, but must be recognized as a mere
moment; for as we have already said, mind is essentially the Idea in the form of
ideality, i.e. in the form of the negatedness of the finite. In mind, therefore, the
finite has only the meaning of something sublated, not of a being. Accordingly,
the authentic quality of the mind is rather genuine infinity, that is, the infinity
which does not one-sidedly stand over against the finite but contains the finite
within itself as a moment. It is, therefore, an empty expression, if one says: 'There
are finite minds . ' Mind as mind

is

not finite, it

has

finitude within itself, but

only as a finitude which is to be, and has been, sublated.6 The genuine defini­
tion of finitude - this is not the place for a more detailed discussion of it - must
be stated thus: the finite is a reality that is not adequate to its concept. Thus
the sun is a finite entity, for it cannot be thought without an Other, since the
reality of its concept comprises not merely the sun itself but the entire solar sys­
tem. Indeed, the whole solar system is a finite entity, because every heavenly body
in it has the semblance of independence of the others; consequently this whole
reality does not as yet correspond to it� concept, does not yet exhibit the same
ideality which is the essence of the concept. It is only the reality of mind that is
itself ideality, only in mind therefore does absolute unity of concept and reality
occur, and hence genuine infinity.? The very fact that we are aware of a limita­
tion is proof that we are beyond it, proof of our unlimitedness. Natural things
are finite simply because their limitation is not present for the things themselves,
but only for us who compare them with one another. We make ourselves into a
finite entity by receiving an Other into our consciousness. But by our very aware­
ness of this Other we are beyond this limitation. Only he who does not know is
limited, for he is not aware of his limitation; whereas he who knows the limita­
tion is aware of it not as a limitation of his knowing, but as something known,
as something belonging to his knowledge. Only the unknown would be a limita­
tion of knowledge; the known limitation, on the contrary, is no limitation of it;
therefore to know of one's limitation means knowing of one's unlimitedness. But
when we pronounce mind to be unlimited, genuinely infinite, we do not mean
to say that there is no limitation whatsoever in the mind; on the contrary, we
have to recognize that mind must determine itself and so make itself finite, lim­
it itsel£ But the intellect is wrong to treat this finitude as a rigid finitude,-to
regard the distinction between the limitation and infinity as an absolutely fixed
distinction, and accordingly to maintain that mind is

either limited or unlimited.

Finitude, properly conceived, is, as we have said, contained in infinity, limitation
in the unlimited. Mind is therefore

both infinite and finite,

and

neither only the

Hegel's Philosophy ofMind

24
one

nor only the other;

in making itself finite it remains infinite, for it sublates

finitude within itself; nothing in the mind is a fixture, a being, rather everything
is only something ideal, only appearing. 8 Thus God, because he is mind, must
determine himself, posit finitude within himself (otherwise he would be only a
dead, empty abstraction) ; but since the reality he assumes by his self-determining
is a reality perfecdy conformable to him, God does not thereby become a finite
entity.9 Therefore, limitation

is not

in God and in mind: it is only posited by

mind in order to be sublated. Only momentarily can mind seem to remain in
a finitude; by its ideality it is raised above it, it knows that the limitation is not
a fixed limitation. It therefore transcends it, frees itself from it, and this is not,
as

the intellect supposes, a liberation never completed, only ever striven for end­

lessly; on the contrary, mind wrests itself out of this progression to infinity, frees
itself absolutely from the limitation, from its Other, and so anains to absolute
being-for-itself, makes itself genuinely infinite. 1 0

§387
Mind, developing in its ideality, is mind as cognitive. Cognition, however, is con­
ceived here not merely as a determinacy of the logical Idea (§223), but in the way
in which the concrete mind determines itself to cognition. 1
Subjective mind is:

(A) In itselfor immediate: a soul or natural mind- the theme ofAnthropology.

(B) For itself or mediated: still as identical reflection into itself and into the
other: mind in relationship or particularization: consciousness-the theme
of the Phenomenology ofMind.
(C) Mind determining itselfin itself, as a subject for itself- the theme of Psychology.
In the soul consciousness awakes: consciousness posits itself as reason, which has
immediately awoken to become self-knowing reason; and by its activity reason
emancipates itself to objectivity, to consciousness of its concept.2
[Remark] In the concept in general the determinacy occurring in it is an
of development; and so in mind too evety

advance
determinacy in which it presents itself is

a moment of the development and, in its continuing determination, a step for­
ward towards its goal, namely, to make itself into, and to become for itself, what it

in itself. The same process takes place within each stage, and its product is that
in itself, or consequently only for us, at the beginning of the
stage, is nowfor the mind itself- i.e. for the mind in the form which it has at that

what the mind was

stage.3 The ordinary method of psychology is to state, in a narrative fashion, what
the mind or the soul is, what happens to it, what it does. The soul is presupposed as
a ready-made subject, in which such determinations come to light only as

sions,

from which we are supposed to learn what it

is,

what sort of faculties and

expression of what
the soul itself, and thereby the

powers it possesses-entirely unconscious of the fact that the

in its concept this very thing for

soul has acquired a higher determination.4 We must, however, distinguish and
exclude from the progression to be studied here what is in fact cultivation and
education. The sphere of education is concerned

only with individual subjects as

such: its aim is to bring the universal mind to existence in them. In the philo­
sophical view of the mind as such, the mind itself is regarded as educating and

Subjective Mind

26

instructing itself in accordance with its concept; and its expressions are seen as
moments of its bringing-itself-forth-to-itself, of its joining-together-with-itself,
whereby it first becomes actual mind.s

Zusatz.

In §385 we distinguished the three main forms of mind: subjective,

objective, and absolute mind, and also indicated the necessity of the advance
from the first to the second and from this to the third. We called the first form
of mind we have to consider

subjective

mind, because here mind is still in its

undeveloped concept, has not as yet made its concept an object for itself. But
in this its subjectivity mind is at the same time objective, has an immediate reality
by the sublation of which it first becomes for itself, attains to itself, to a grasp of
its concept, of its subjectivity. We could therefore just as well say that mind is, to
begin with, objective and has to become subjective, as conversely, that it is first
subjective and has to make itself objective. Consequently, we must not regard the
distinction between subjective and objective mind as a rigid distinction. Even at
the beginning, we have to grasp mind not as mere concept, as something merely
subjective, but as Idea, as a unity of the subjective and the objective, and every
advance from this beginning is a movement beyond the- first simple subjectivity
of mind, a progress in the development of its reality or objectivity.6 This devel­
opment brings forth a series of formations; these, it is true, must be indicated
by empirical research, but in philosophical inquiry they cannot remain externally
juxtaposed, but are to be recognized as the appropriate expression of a necessary
series of determinate concepts, and they are of interest to philosophical think­
ing only in so far as they express such a series of concepts. However, initially
we can only indicate dogmatically the different formations of subjective mind;
their necessity will emerge only from the determinate development of subjective
mind.?
The three main forms of subjective mind are:

( 1 ) soul, (2) comciousness,

and

(3) mind as such. As soul, mind has the form of abstract universality; as conscious­
ness, that ofparticularization; and as mind that is for itself, that of individuality.
This is how subjective mind in its development exhibits the development of
the concept. 8 The reason why, in the above Paragraph, the names anthropology,
phenomenology, and psychology have been given to the parts of science correspond­
ing to these three forms of subjective mind, will become evident from a more
detailed, preliminary statement of the content of the science of subjective mind.
We must begin our treatment with immediate mind; but this is

soul. To suppose that we should

natural mind,

begin with the mere concept of mind would be

a mistake; for as we have already said, mind is always Idea, therefore actualized
concept. But at the beginning, the concept of mind cannot as yet have the medi­
ated reality which it acquires in abstract thinking; of course, even at the beginning
its reality must already be an abstract reality- only in this way does it correspond
to the ideality of mind; but it is necessarily a reality that is still unmediated, not
yet posited, consequently a reality that just

is,

external to mind, a reality given

27

Subjective Mind

by nature. We must begin, therefore, with the mind still in the grip of nature,
related to its bodiliness, mind that is not as yet together with itself, not yet free.9
This foundation of man (if we may so express it) is the theme of anthropology. In
this part of the science of subj ective mind, the concept of mind, as conceived by

thought, is only in us, the

inquirers, not as yet in the object itself; what forms the

object of our inquiry here is the concept of mind that at first merely is, the mind
that has not yet grasped its concept and is still external to itself.10
The first stage in

anthropology

is the qualitatively determined soul tied to its

natural determinations (racial differences, for

exam ple,

belong here) . Out of this

immediate oneness with its naturalness, soul enters into opposition and conflict
with it (the states of derangement and somnambulism belong here) . The out­
come of this conflict is the triumph of the soul over its bodiliness, the process of
reducing, and the accomplished reduction, of this bodiliness to a sign, to the por­
trayal of the soul. The ideality of the soul thus emerges in its bodiliness and this
reality of the mind is posited ideally, but still in a bodily manner.11
In phenomenology, the soul, by the negation of its bodiliness, raises itself to pure
ideal self-identity, becomes consciousness, becomes I, is for itself over against its
Other. But this first being-for-self of mind is still conditioned by the Other from
which the mind originates. The I is still completely empty, an entirely abstract
subjectivity; it posits all the content of immediate mind outside itself and relates
to it as to a world it finds before it. Thus what was initially only our object, does
indeed become an object for mind itself, but the I does not yet know that what
confronts it is the natural mind itself. Therefore, the I, in spite of its being-for­
self, is at the same time not for itself, for it is only in relation to an Other, to
something given. The freedom of the I is consequently only an abstract, condi­
tioned, relative freedom.l2 True, mind here is no longer immersed in nature but
reflected into itself and related to nature, but it only appears, stands only in rela­
tion to actuality, is not yet

actual mind. Therefore, we call the part of the science

in which this form of mind is treated, phenomenology. 1 3 But now the I, in reflect­
ing itself into itself out of its relation to Other, becomes self-consciousness. In
this form, the I initially knows itself only as the unfulfilled I, and all concrete
content as an Other. Here the activity of the I consists in filling the void of its
abstract subjectivity, in building the objective into itself but, on the other hand,
irr making the subjective objective. In this way, self-consciousness sublates the
one-sidedness of its subjectivity, emerges from its particularity, from its oppos­
ition to the objective, into the universaliry embracing both sides, and displays
within itself the unity of itself with consciousness; for the content of mind here
becomes an objective content, as in consciousness, and at the same time, as in
self-consciousness, a subjective content.14 This universal self-consciousness is, in
itself or for us,

reason;

but it is only in the third part of the science of subjective

mind that reason becomes an object to itself.15
This

third part, psychology, treats

of mind as such, the mind as it relates itself,

in the object, only to itself, has to do therein only with its own determinations,

Subjective Mind

28

grasps its own concept. Thus mind comes to truth; for the unity of the subject­
ive and the objective which, in mere soul, is still immediate, still abstract, is now,
by sublation of the opposition arising in consciousness between these determ­
inations, restored as a mediated unity; thus the Idea of mind emerges from its
contradictory form of simple concept, and from the equally contradictory separ­
ation of its moments, to mediated unity and accordingly to true actuality. l 6 In
this shape, mind is

reason that isfor itself Mind and reason stand in the same rela­

tionship to each other as body and heaviness, as will and freedom. Reason forms
the substantial nature of mind; it is only another expression for truth or the Idea,
which constitutes the essence of mind; but it is only mind as such that knows that
its nature is reason and truthY The mind that embraces both sides, subjectivity
and objectivity, now posits itself firstly in the form of subjectivity, and then it is

intelligence;

secondly, in the form of objectivity, and then it is

will.

Intelligence,

which is itself initially still unfulfilled, sublates its form of subjectivity, which
does not conform to the concept of mind, in the following way: it measures the
objective content confronting it, still burdened with the form of givenness and
individuality, by the absolute standard of reason, it imposes rationality on this
content, informs it with the Idea, transforms it into a concrete universal, and thus
receives it into itself. Intelligence thereby reaches the point where what it knows
is not an abstraction but the objective concept, and where, on the other hand,
the object loses the form of a given and acquires the shape of a content pertain­
ing to mind itself.18 But intelligence, in attaining consciousness that it takes the
content from itself, becomes practical mind which posits only itself for its goal,
becomes will, which, unlike intelligence, does not begin with an individual given
from outside, but with the sort of individual that it knows to be its own. Then,
reflecting itself into itself out of this content, out of urges, inclinations, it relates
the content to a universal; and finally it raises itself to the willing of the univer­
sal in and for itself, of freedom, of its concept. Having reached this goal, mind
has returned to its beginning, to unity with itself, but equally it has progressed to
absolute uniry with itself, a unity genuinely determined within itself, a unity in
which the determinations are determinations not of nature but of the concept.19

Mind has

the truth of nature. In the Idea in general this res­

ult has the meaning of the truth and of what is prior, rather than posterior, as
compared with what precedes it. But, besides this, becoming or transition has,
in the concept, the more determinate meaning offree judgement. The mind that
has come into being means, therefore, that nature in its own self sublates itself
as what is untrue, and mind thus presupposes itself as this universality that is no

its concretion and

The soul is not only immaterial for itself. It is the universal immateriality of
nature, its simple ideal life. 1 Soul is the

the absolute foundation of

all the particularizing and individualizing of mind, so that it is in the soul that

mind finds all the stuff of its

determination, and the soul remains the pervading,

identical ideality of this determination. But in this still abstract determination,
the soul is only the sleep of mind- the passive vous of Aristotle, which is poten­

tially all things.2

But in modern times even the physicists have

found matter grown thinner in their hands; they have hit upon

imponderable

matters, such as heat, light, etc., to which they could easily add space and time
as well. These imponderables, which have lost the property (characteristic of mat­

ter) of weight and, in a sense, even the capacity of offering resistance, have still,
however, a sensory reality, a self-externality; whereas the vital matter, which may
also be found counted among them, not only lacks weight, but even every other
reality which would lead us to count it as

material.

The fact is that in the Idea

of life the self-externality of nature is already sublated

in itself, and the concept,

the substance oflife takes the form of subjectivity, but only in such a way that its
existence or objectivity is at the same time still under the sway of self-externality.
But mind is the concept whose existence is not immediate individuality, but
absolute negativity, freedom, so that the object or the reality of the concept is

determination of matter, has completely evaporated into the subjective ideality
of the concept, into universality. Mind is the existent truth of matter- the truth

in the pores, was consistent in not imposing on them any communion with the
world. An answer that cannot be regarded as equivalent to this one has been given
by all philosophers ever since this relationship came up for discussion. Descartes,
Malebranche, Spinoza, and Leibniz have all specified God as this relation. They
did so in the sense that matter and the finitude of the soul are only ideal determ­

Zusatz.

In the introduction to the philosophy of mind, we noted how nature

itself sublates its externality and individualization, its materiality, as an untruth
which is inadequate to the concept dwelling in it, and by thus acquiring immater­
iality it passes over into mind. That is why, in the above Paragraph, immediate
mind, the soul, is determined not merely as immaterial for itself, but as the
universal immateriality of nature, and also as substance, as unity of thinking
and being. This unity constitutes the fundamental intuition even in oriental­
ism. Light, which in the Persian religion was regarded as the absolute, had the
meaning of a spiritual entity j ust as much as a physical entity.5 Spinoza con­
ceived this unity more determinately as the absolute foundation of everything.
Even though mind may withdraw into itself, may take its stand at the extreme
point of its subjectivity, yet it is

implicitly in that unity.

But it cannot stop there;

it attains to absolute being-for-self, to a perfectly adequate form, only by devel­
oping in an immanent manner the difference, which in substance is still simple,
into an actual difference, and by bringing this difference back into unity; only
by doing this does it break free of the state of sleep, which belongs to it as
soul. For in soul, the difference is still shrouded in the form of undifferenti­
atedness and therefore of unconsciousness. The defect of Spinoza's philosophy

31

Anthropology, The Soul

consists, therefore, j ust i n this: in it substance does not advance to its immanent
development, the manifold is added to substance only in an external manner.6
The same unity of thought and being is contained in the vofls of Anaxagoras; but
this vous failed even more than Spinoza's substance to achieve a development of
its own.? Pantheism fails altogether to advance to an organization and system­
atization. Where pantheism appears in the form of representation, it is a reeling
life, an intuitive bacchanalian vision, which does not let the individual shapes
of the universe emerge in their articulation but perpetually submerges them in
the universal again and inflates them into the sublime and the monstrous. This
intuition, however, forms a natural starring-point for every stout heart. In youth
especially, we feel a kinship and sympathy with the whole of nature through a
life which ensouls ourselves and everything around us and so we have a sensa­
tion of the world-soul, of the unity of mind and nature, of the immateriality of
the latter. 8
But when we leave feeling behind and go on to

reflection,

then the opposi­

tion of soul and matter, of my subjective I and its bodiliness, becomes for us a
fixed opposition, and the reciprocal relation of body and soul becomes an inter­
action of independent entities. The usual physiological and psychological treat­
ment does not know how to overcome the rigidity of this opposition. In that
treatment, the I as thoroughly simple and unitary, this abyss of all representa­
tions, and matter as the many, the composite, confront each other in absolute
abruptness,- and the answer to the question, how this many is united with that
abstract one, is naturally declared to be impossible. 9
The immateriality of one side of this opposition, namely, of the soul, is readily
conceded; but the other side of it, the material, remains standing for us, at the
standpoint of merely reflective thinking, as a fixture, as something that we accept
along with the immateriality of the soul; so we ascribe to the material the same
being as to the immaterial and hold both to be equally substantial and absolute.
This mode of treatment also prevailed in former metaphysics. This metaphys­
ics, however, though firmly holding the opposition between the material and the
immaterial to be insuperable, yet, on the other hand, unwittingly sublated the
opposition again by making the soul into a

thing,

consequently into something

which, though entirely abstract, was nonetheless straight away determined by
sensory relationships. This metaphysics achieved this effect by its question about
the seat of the soul - it thereby placed the soul in

space;

similarly by its ques­

tion about the origin and decease of the soul- it was thereby placed in

time; and

thirdly, by its question about the propenies of the soul, for the soul is thereby
regarded as something static, fixed, as the focal point of these determinations. 1 0
Even Leibniz treated soul a s a thing, i n making it, like everything else, into a
monad; the monad is j ust as static as a thing, and the entire difference between
the soul and the material, according to Leibniz, consists only in soul's being
a somewhat more distinct, more developed, monad than the rest of matter-a

32

Subjective Mind

representation by which the material is doubtless exalted, but soul is reduced to,
rather than distinguished from, a material entity. I I

Speculative logic lifts us above the whole o f this merely reflective way of look­
ing at things simply by showing that all these determinations applied to the
soul-such as thing, simplicity, indivisibility, one- are, when conceived in an
abstract way, untrue and veer round into their opposites. But the philosophy
of mind continues this proof of the untruth of such categories of the intellect
by demonstrating how all fixed determinations are sublated in the mind by its
ideality. 1 2
Now as regards the other side of the opposition in question, namely mat­
ter, we have already remarked that externality, individualization, multiplicity are
regarded as its fixed determination, and the unity of this multiplicity is therefore
declared to be only a superficial bond, a composition, and accordingly everything
material to be separable. We must, of course, admit that whereas with mind, the
concrete unity is the essential and the multiplicity is a semblance, with matter the
reverse is the case; the old metaphysics already showed an awareness of this when
it asked whether, in the case of the mind, the one or the many has priority. B
That the externality and multiplicity of matter cannot be overcome by nature is
a presupposition which, at our standpoint, at the standpoint of speculative philo­
sophy, we have here long since left behind us as invalid. The philosophy of nature
teaches us how nature sublates its externality by stages, how matter already refutes
the independence of the individual, of the many, by gravity, and how this refut­
ation begun by gravity, and still more by simple, indivisible

light,

is completed

by animal life, by the sentient creature, since this reveals to us the omnipresence
of the one soul at every point of its bodiliness, and so the sublatedness of the
asunderness of matter. Since, then, everything material is sublated by the mind
that is in itself and at work within nature, and this sublation is consummated
in the substance of soul, the soul emerges as the ideality of everything material,
as

all immateriality, so that everything called matter,

however much it simulates

independence to representation, is known to have no independence in the face
ofmind. 1 4
The opposition of soul and body must, o f course, b e made. Just as the inde­
terminate universal soul determines itself, individualizes itself, j ust as mind
thereby becomes consciousness- and it necessarily advances to consciousness­
so the mind places itself at the standpoint of opposition between itself and its
Other, its Other appears to it as something real, something external to mind
and to itself, something material. 1 5 At this standpoint, the question about the
possibility of the communion of the soul and the physical body is an entirely
natural one. If soul and body are absolutely opposed to each other, as intel­
lectual consciousness maintains, then there is no possibility of any communion
between them. Now this communion was recognized by the old metaphysics as
an undeniable fact. Therefore, the question arose as to how the contradiction,

Anthropology, The Soul

33

that entities that are absolutely independent, for themselves, are yet in unity with
each other, could be solved. When the question was posed in this way, it was
impossible to answer. But it is j ust this way of posing it that must be recognized as
inadmissible; for in truth the immaterial is not related to the material as a partic­
ular is to a particular, but as the genuine universal which overarches particularity
is related to the particular; the material in its particularization has no truth, no
independence in face of the immaterial. Consequently, the standpoint of sep­
aration is not to be regarded as final, as absolutely true. On the contrary, the
separation of the material and the immaterial can be explained only on the basis
of the original unity of both. Therefore, in the philosophies of Descartes, Mal­
ebranche, and Spinoza, a return is made to such a unity of thinking and being,
of mind and matter, and this unity is placed in God. Malebranche said: We see
everything in God. He treated God as the mediation, as the positive medium,
between what thinks and what does not think, and, indeed, as the immanent,
pervasive essence in which both sides are sublated, - consequently, not as a third
term over against two extremes which themselves have an actuality; for in that
case the question would again arise as to how that third term comes together with
these two extremes. But in placing the unity of the material and the immaterial
in God, who is to be conceived essentially as mind, the philosophers mentioned
wished to convey that this unity must not be taken as something neutral in which
two extremes of equal significance and independence come together, since the
material has no meaning at all beyond that of a negative over against mind and
over against itself, or must be described-as Plato and other ancient philosoph­
ers expressed it-as the 'Other of itself, whereas we must recognize the nature
of mind as the positive, as the speculative, because the mind freely pervades the
material, which lacks independence in face of it, mind overarches this its Other,
does not accept it as something genuinely real but idealizes it and reduces it to
something mediated.I6
Confronting this speculative conception of the opposition between mind and
matter stands

materialism,

which portrays thinking as a result of the material,

derives the simplicity of thinking from the manifold. There is nothing more
unsatisfactory than the discussions conducted in materialistic writings of the vari­
ous relationships and combinations by which a result such as thinking is sup­
posed to be produced. Such discussions entirely overlook the fact that, j ust as the
cause is sublated in the effect, and the means in the accomplished end, so too that
from which thinking is supposed to result is conversely sublated in thinking, and
rhat mind as such is not produced by an Other, but raises itself from its being­
in-itself to being-for-itself, from its concept to actuality, and makes that by which
mind is supposed to be posited into something posited by mind. All the same, we
must recognize in materialism the enthusiastic endeavour to transcend the dual­
ism which assumes two different worlds as equally substantial and true, to sublate
this dismemberment of what is originally one . 1 7

The soul is at first:

(b) as individual, it enters into relationship with its immediate being, and, in
the determinacies of that being, is abstractlyfor itself-feelingsoul;

Zusatz.

The first part of Anthropology indicated in this Paragraph, which com­

prises the natural soul, the soul that simply is, in turn splits up into

three sections.

In the first section we have initially to deal with the still entirely universal, imme­
diate substance of mind, with the simple pulsation, the mere inward stirring, of
soul. In this first mental life no distinction is yet posited, either of individuality in
contrast to universality or of soul in contrast to the natural. This simple life has its
explication in nature and in mind; it itself as such j ust is, it has as yet no reality, no
determinate being, no particularization, no actuality. But j ust as, in logic, being
must pass over into determinate being, so soul too necessarily progresses from its
indeterminacy to determinacy. This determinacy initially has, as already noted
earlier, the form of naturalness. But the natural determinacy of soul is to be con­
ceived as a totality, as a copy of the concept. The first stage here is therefore the

universal, qualitative determinations of soul. Here belong especially the
racial differences, both physical and mental, of humanity and also the differences

entirely

of national mentality.2
These divergent

universal

particularizations or varieties are then- and this

forms the transition to the second section - taken back into the unity of soul or,
what is the same thing, promoted to individualization. Just as light splinters into
an infinite host of stars, so too the universal natural soul splinters into an infin­
ite host of individual souls, only with the difference, that whereas light has the
semblance of a subsistence independent of the stars, the universal natural soul
attains actuality only in the individual souls. 3 Now since the diverging univer­
sal qualities considered in the first section, are taken back, as we said above, into
the unity of the individual human soul, instead of the form of externality they
acquire the shape of natural

alterations of the individual subject who

persists in

them. These alterations, which are also both mental and physical, emerge in the
course of the

stages oflife.

Here the difference ceases to be an external one. But

it is in the sexual relationship that the difference becomes actual particularization,
real opposition of the individual to itself. From this point on, the soul in general
enters into opposition to its natural qualities, to its universal being, which, by this
very fact, is reduced to the Other of the soul, to a mere aspect, to a transitory

state, namely, to the state ofsleep. Thus originates natural waking, the opening out
of the soul. But here in Anthropology we have not yet to consider the fulfilment

rhar accrues to waking consciousness but waking only in so far as it is a natural

opposition, or of real particularization, soul now
third section, to unity with itself, by removing from its Other too

From this relationship of
returns, in the

the fixity of a state, and dissolving the Other in the soul's ideality. Soul has thus

universal individuality, which is only in itself, to actual
itself; and in doing this it has progressed to sensation.
Initially, we have to deal here only with theform of sensing. What the soul senses
is to be specified only in the second part of Anthropology. The transition to this
part is formed by the expansion of sensation within itself to the boding soul. 5
progressed from merely

individuality

that is for

(a) THE NA TURAL S O UL

§391
The

universal soul

world-soul, as a sort of
substance, which has its actu­

must not be fixed, in the form of a

subject; for the universal soul is only the universal

individuality, subjectivity. Thus it presents itself as an individual
is, with natural determinacies in
determinacies have, so to speak, behind their ideality a free existence:

al truth only as

soul, but immediately only as a soul which j ust
it. These

i.e. they are natural objects for consciousness, though the soul as such does not
respond to them as external objects. Rather, these determinations are

qualities which it has in itself. 1
Zusatz. The soul, when contrasted
can

natural

with the macrocosm o f nature a s a whole,

be described as the microcosm into which the macrocosm compresses itself

and thereby sublates its asunderness. Accordingly the same determinations which
in outer nature appear as freely disengaged spheres, as a series of independent
shapes, are in the soul demoted to mere qualities. The soul stands midway
between the nature which lies behind it, on the one hand, and the world of ethical
freedom which extricates itself from natural mind, on the other hand. The simple
determinations of soul-life have their dispersed counterpart in the universal life of
nature; similarly, that which in the individual man has the form of subjectivity,
of a particular urge, and is within him unconsciously, as simply something he

is,

unfolds in the political state into a system of distinct spheres of freedom, into a
world created by self-conscious human reason. 2

(a) Natural Qualities

§392
(1)

In its substance, in the natural soul, the mind takes part in the universal plan­

etary life, feels the difference of climates, the changes of the seasons, the periods
of the day, etc. In the mind this life of nature emerges only in occasional dark
moods. 1
[Remark] In recent times a good deal has been said of the

telluric

cosmic, sidereal,

and

life of man.2 Animals essentially live in such a sympathy with nature:

36

Subjective Mind

their specific characters and the particular ways in which they develop are con­
nected with it, in many cases completely, and always to some extent. In the case
of man, the more cultivated he is and the more his whole condition rests on a free,
spiritual foundation, the less the significance that such connections have. World­
history is not connected with revolutions in the solar system, any more than
the destinies of individuals are tied to the positions of the planets. 3 Differences
of climate involve a more solid and vigorous determinacy. But the response to
changes of the seasons and hours of the day is found only in feeble moods, which
can become especially prominent only in illnesses (including derangement) and
in the depression of self-conscious life.4 Alongside popular superstitions and the
aberrations of the feeble intellect, there are also to be found, among peoples less
advanced in spiritual freedom and therefore living more in unison with nature,

some actual cases of such connections, and, based on them, what seem to be mar­
vellous prophetic visions of states of affairs and of events linked to them. But as
freedom of mind gets a deeper grasp of itself, even these few and slight disposi­
tions, based on participation in the life of nature, disappear.5 Animals and plants,
by contrast, remain subject to such influences.

Zusatz. It is clear from §39 1

and its Zusatz that the universal life of nature is also

the life of the soul, that the soul lives in sympathy with that universal life. But it
would be a complete mistake to make this participation of the soul in the life of
the whole universe into the highest object of the science of mind. For the activ­
ity of mind essentially consists just in raising itself above this entanglement in
merely natural life, in grasping itself in its independence, subjecting the world to
its thinking and creating it from the concept. In mind, therefore, the universal life
of nature is only an entirely subordinate moment; the cosmic and telluric powers
are dominated by mind, they can produce in it only an insignificant mood.
Now the universal life of nature is first, the life of the solar system generally,
and secondly, the life of the earth, in which the life of the solar system acquires a
more individual form.

As regards the relation of the soul to the solar system, we may note that astro­
logy links rhe destinies of humanity and of individuals with the configurations
and positions of the planets (as, in modern times, the world in general has been
considered as a mirror of mind in the sense that the the mind can be explained
from the world) .6 The content of astrology is to be rejected as superstition; but
science is under an obligation to indicate the determinate ground for this rejec­
tion. This ground must not be located merely in the fact that the planets are
bodies and remote from us, but more specifically in the fact that the planetary life
of the solar system is only a life of motion, in other words, is a life in which space
and time constitute the determining factor; for space and time are the moments
of mocion. The laws of the motion of the planets are determined solely by the
concept of space and of time; it is, therefore, in the planets that absolutely free
rnocion has its actuality. But even in what is physically individual this abstract

Anthropology, The Soul

37

motion is something completely subordinate; the individual in general makes its
own space and time; its alteration is determined by its concrete nature. The anim­
al body attains to even greater independence than the merely physical individual;
the course of its development is quite independent of the motion of the planets,
the measure of its lifespan is not determined by them; its health and the course of
its disease do not depend on the planets; periodic fevers, for example, have their
own determinate measure; in fevers the determinant is not time as time, but the
animal organism. Bur for mind the abstract determinations of space and time, the
free mechanism, have no significance and no power whatsoever; the determina­
tions of self-conscious mind are infinitely more substantial, more concrete, than
the abstract determinations of juxtaposition and succession. Mind, as embodied,
is indeed in a definite place and in a definite time; bur it is nevertheless elevated
above space and time. Of course, the life of man is conditioned by a determinate
measure of the distance of the earth from the sun; he could not live at either a
greater or a lesser distance from the sun; but the influence of the position of the
earth on mankind does not extend any further.?
Even the strictly terrestrial relationships- the annual revolution of the earth
round the sun, the daily axial rotation of the earth, the inclination of the earth's
axis to the course of its movement round the sun - all these determinations
belonging to the earth's individuality, though not without influence on mankind,
are unimportant for the mind as such. The Church itself has therefore rightly
rejected as superstitious and unethical the belief in a power exercised over the
human spirit by these terrestrial and cosmic relationships. Man should regard
himself as free from such relationships of nature; bur in that superstition he
regards himself as a natural entity. Accordingly, we must also brand as worthless
the undertaking of those who have endeavoured to bring the evolutionary epochs
of the earth into connection with the epochs of human history, to discover the
origin of religions and their images in the realm of astronomy and then too in the
physical realm, and have there hit upon the groundless and baseless notion that
j ust as the equinox moved forward from the Bull to the Ram, Apis worship had
necessarily to be followed by Christianity, by the worship of the Lamb. s
Bur as regards the influence actually exerted by terrestrial relationships on man,
here we can only mention the main factors, since the details belong to the nat­
ural history of man and the earth. In the seasons and the times of the day, the
process of the motion of the earth acquires a physical significance. These altern­
ations do, of course, affect man; the merely natural mind, the soul, lives in sym­
pathy with the mood of the season and of the time of day. Bur whereas plants
are completely bound to the alternation of the seasons and even animals are
unconsciously dominated by it, being instinctively impelled to mate and some
to migration, in the human soul this alternation does not produce any excita­
tions to which man is involuntarily subjected. The disposition of winter is the
disposition of withdrawal into oneself, of composing oneself, of family life, of the
worship of the penates. In the summer, on the other hand, we feel particularly

38

Subjective Mind

inclined to travel, we feel drawn into the open air, and the common people go
off in a crowd on pilgrimages. Yet there is nothing merely instinctive about either
this more intimate family life or these pilgrimages and journeys. The Christian
festivals are linked with the alternation of the seasons; the festival of the birth of
Christ is celebrated at the time when the sun seems to go forth again; the resur­
rection of Christ is placed at the beginning of spring, in the period of nature's
awakening. But similarly this association of the religious with the natural is one
made consciously, not instinctively.

As regards the phases of the moon, these have only a limited influence even on

the physical nature of man. Such an influence has been observed on lunatics; but
in them also the power of nature is dominant, not the free mind.9 Moreover the
times of day, of course, bring with them a characteristic disposition of the soul.
We are in different moods in the morning and evening. In the morning serious­
ness prevails, the mind is still more in identity with itself and with nature. The
day belongs to opposition, to work. In the evening, reflection and fancy predom­
inate. At midnight, mind retires into itself from the distractions of the day, is
alone with itself and inclined to contemplation. Most people die after midnight;
human nature is there unable to start yet another day. There is also a certain rela­
tion between the times of day and the public life of peoples. The ancients, who
were more drawn to nature than we are, held their public assemblies in the morn­
ing; in England, on the contrary, in keeping with the introverted character of
the English, parliamentary proceedings are started in the evening and sometimes
continued far into the night. But these moods produced by the times of the day
are modified by climate; in hot countries, for example, one feels at midday more

disposed to rest than to activity.

With respect to the influence of meteorological changes we can mention the
following. Sensitivity to these phenomena is distinctly noticeable in plants and
animals. Thus animals have presentiments of thunderstorms and earthquakes, i.e.
they feel atmospheric changes which have not yet become apparent to us. Human
beings, too, sense in wounds changes in the weather not yet indicated by the
barometer; the weak spot formed by the wound allows the power of nature to
become more noticeable. What is thus determining for the organism has also a
significance for weak minds and is sensed as an effect. Indeed whole peoples, the
Greeks and Romans, made their decisions depend on natural phenomena which
to them seemed to be connected with meteorological changes. As we know, they
consulted not only the priests, but also the entrails and feed of animals, for advice
on affairs of state. On the day of the battle of Plataea, for example, when the free­
dom of Greece, perhaps of the whole of Europe, the repulse of oriental despot­
ism, was at stake, Pausanias tortured himself the whole morning about good signs
from sacrificial animals. 1o This seems to stand in complete contradiction with the
mindfulness of the Greeks in art, religion, and science, but it can be very well
explained from the standpoint of the Greek mind. It is characteristic of modems,
in everything which prudence declares advisable in such and such circumstances,

Anthropology, The Soul

39

to make a decision for themselves; private persons as well as princes take their
decisions for themselves; with us the subjective will cuts off all grounds of delib­
eration and determines itself to the deed. The ancients, by contrast, who had not
yet attained to this power of subjectivity, to this strength of self-certainty, let their
affairs be determined by oracles, by external phenomena, in which they sought
confirmation and verification of their plans and intentions. 1 1 Now as regards the
case of battle in particular, it depends not merely on the ethical disposition but
also on the mood of buoyancy, on the feeling of physical strength. But with the
ancients, this disposition was of far greater importance than it is with the mod­
erns, with whom the main thing is the discipline of the army and the talent of
the commander, whereas with the ancients, who still lived more in unity with
nature, the bravety of individuals, the courage that always has something physic­
al as its source, made the largest contribution to the decision of the battle. Now
the mood of courage is connected with other physical dispositions, e.g. with the
disposition of the region, of the atmosphere, of the season, of the climate. But
the sympathetic moods of ensouled life become more visibly apparent in anim­
als than in human beings, since animals live in an even closer unity with nature.
For this reason the Greek commander only went into battle when he believed he
had found in the animals healthy dispositions, which seemed to permit an infer­
ence to good dispositions of men. 12 Thus Xenophon, who conducts himself so
shrewdly in his famous retreat, sacrifices daily and determines his militaty meas­
ures in accordance with the result of the sacrifice. l 3 But the ancients took this
search for a connection between the natural and the spiritual too far. Their super­
stition saw more in the animals' entrails than is there to be seen. In this, the I
surrendered its independence, subjected itself to the circumstances and determin­
ations of externality, made them into determinations of mind.

§393
(2)

The universal planetaty life of the natural mind particularizes itself into the

concrete differences of the earth and breaks up into the particular

natural minds

which, on the whole, express the nature of the geographical regions of the world
and constitute the diversities of race.
[Remark] The opposition of terrestrial polarity, in virtue of which the land
towards the north is more concentrated and predominates over the sea, whereas
in the southern hemisphere it tapers off into separate sharp points, introduces
into the differences of world-regions a further modification which

(Biology, Vol. 11) has demonstrated in the case of the flora and fauna. 1
Zusatz. With respect to the diversity of races of mankind it must

Treviranus
be noticed

first of all that the merely historical question, whether all human races sprang
from

one couple or from several, is of no concern whatever to

us in philosophy.2

Importance was attached to this question because it was believed that by assum­
ing descent from several couples, the mental superiority of one human stock over

Subjective Mind

40

another could be explained, indeed, it was hoped to prove that human beings are
by nature so diverse in their mental capacities that some may be dominated like
animals. But descent affords no ground for the entitlement or non-entitlement
of human beings to freedom and to dominion. Man is implicitly rational; herein
lies the possibility of equality of right for all men , - the futility of a rigid distinc­
tion between races that have rights and those that have none.3- The difference
between the races of mankind is still a natural difference, that is, a difference that
initially concerns the natural soul. As such, the difference is connected with the
geographical differences of the territory where human beings congregate in large
masses. These differences of territory are what we call world-regions. In these
subdivisions of the earth-individual something necessary prevails, the detailed
discussion of which belongs to geography. The basic division of the earth is into
the

Old and

the

New World.

Initially, this distinction relates to the earlier or

later knowledge of the continents in world history. Here, this meaning is for us
a matter of indifference. What concerns us here is the determinacy which con­
stitutes the distinctive character of the world-regions. In this respect, it must be
said that America has a younger aspect than the Old World and lags behind it

in its historical formation . America exhibits only the general difference of north

and south with a quite narrow middle between the two extremes. The indigen­
ous peoples of this world-region are dying out; the Old World is refashioning
itself in the New. The Old World differs from America in that it presents itself as
sundered into determinate differences, divides into three continents, of which
one,

Africa,

taken as a whole, appears as a mass belonging to compact unity,

as a lofty mountain range shutting off the coast; the second,

Asia,

succumbs to

the opposition of highlands and great valleys irrigated by broad rivers; while the
third,

Europe,

reveals the unity of the undifferentiated unity of Africa and the

unmediated opposition of Asia, since here mountain and valley are not juxta­
posed as two great halves of the continent as in Asia, but constantly penetrate
each other. These three continents lie around the Mediterranean, but they are
linked together by it, not separated. North Africa up to the boundary of the sandy
desert already by its character belongs to Europe; the inhabitants of this part of
Africa are not yet strictly Africans, that is, negroes, but are akin to Europeans.
Similarly the whole of Western Asia is European in character; the Asiatic race
proper, the Mongols, inhabit the Far East.4
After having thus attempted to show that the differences between the
continents are not contingent but necessary, 5 we wish to determine, in a physical
and spiritual respect, the racial diversities of humanity connected with these
geographical differences. In the physical respect, physiology distinguishes the
Caucasian, Ethiopian, and Mongolian races, and there are also the race of
Malaya and of America, though these form an aggregate of infinitely various
particularities rather than a sharply distinct race. Now the physical difference
between all these races is shown mainly in the formation of the skull and the

Anthropology, The Soul

41

face. The formation o f the skull is to b e determined b y a horizontal and a vertical
line, the former running from the outside of the auditory canal to the root of
the nose, the latter from the frontal bone to the upper jaw. It is by the angle
formed by these two lines that the head of the animal is distinguished from the
human head; in animals this angle is extremely acute. Another important factor
in establishing racial differences, noted by Blumenbach, concerns the greater or
lesser prominence of the cheek-bones. The arching and width of the forehead is
also a determining factor here. 6
Now in the

Caucasian

race the aforesaid angle is almost or entirely a

right angle. This applies particularly to the Italian, Georgian, and Circassian
physiognomy. In this race the skull is spherical on top, the forehead gently
arched, the cheek-bones pushed back, the front teeth in both jaws perpendicular,
the skin white with red cheeks and the hair long and sofi:.
The characteristic of the

Mongolian

race is shown in the prominence of the

cheek-bones, in the eyes which are not round but narrow-slit, in the compressed
nose, in the yellow colour of the skin and in the short stiff black hair.

Negroes have

narrower skulls than Mongols and Caucasians, their foreheads

are arched but bulging, their jaw-bones are prominent and the teeth slope, their
lower jaw j uts well out, their skin is more or less black, their hair is woolly and
black.

The Malayan and American race are less sharply distinguished in their physical

formation than the races j ust described; the skin of the Malayan race is brown and
that of the American race copper-coloured.
In a spiritual respect the races referred to differ in the following way.
Negroes are to be regarded as a nation of children who remain immersed

in

their uninterested and indifferent naivete. They are sold, and let themselves be
sold, without any reflection on whether this is right or not. Their religion has
something childlike about it. They sense a higher being, but they do not keep a
firm hold on it; it passes only fleetingly through their heads. This higher being
they transfer to the first stone they come across, thus making it their fetish and
they discard this fetish if it fails to help them. Entirely good-natured and harmless
when in a state of calm, they can become suddenly agitated and then commit the
most frightful cruelties. They cannot be denied a capacity for education; not only
have they, here and there, adopted Christianity with the greatest gratitude and
spoken with emotion of the freedom they have acquired through Christianity
after a long spiritual servitude, but in Haiti they have even formed a state on
Christian principles. But they do not show an inner impulse towards culture.
In their native country the most shocking despotism prevails. There they do
not attain to the feeling of man's personality, - their mind is entirely dormant,
it remains sunk within itself, it makes no progress, and thus corresponds to
the compact,

undifferentiated mass

of the African land.l The

Mongols,

on the

other hand, rise above this childish naivete; they reveal as their characteristic

Subjective Mind

42

feature a restless mobility which comes to no fixed result and impels them to
spread like monstrous locust swarms over other nations and then gives way to the
thoughtless indifference and dull inertia which preceded this outburst. Similarly,
the Mongols display in themselves an acute contrast between the sublime and
immense, on the one hand, and the most petty pedantry, on the other. Their
religion already contains the representation of a universal which they venerate
as God. But this God is not yet endured as an invisible God; he is present in
human shape, or at least announces himself through some human being or other.
This occurs with the Tibetans, where often a child is chosen as the present god,
and when such a god dies, the monks seek another god among mankind; but all
these gods enjoy the profoundest veneration one after the other. The essentials
of this religion reach as far as the Indians, among whom a human being, the
Brahman, is likewise regarded as God, and the withdrawal of the human mind
into its indeterminate universality is held to be the divine, to be the immediate
identity with God. So in the Asiatic race mind is certainly already beginning to
awake, to separate itself from naturalness. But this separation is not yet clear-cut,
not yet absolute. Mind does not yet grasp itself in its absolute freedom, does not
yet know itself as the concrete universal that is for itself, has not yet made its
concept into its object in the form of thought. For this reason mind still exists
in the form of immediate individuality, a form in contradiction with mind. God

does indeed become an object for them, but not in the form of the absolutely
free thought, but in that of an immediately existent finite mind. With this is
connected the worship of the dead that occurs here. This involves an elevation
above naturalness, for in the dead naturalness has perished; the remembrance
of them holds fast only to the universal that appeared in them and thus rises
above the individuality of the appearance. But the universal is always, on the one
hand, held fast only as an entirely abstract universal, and on the other hand, is
viewed only in a thoroughly contingent, immediate existence. The Indians, for
example, regard the universal God as present in the whole of nature, in rivers and
mountains j ust as in men. Asia displays then, both in a physical and a spiritual
respect, the moment of

opposition,

unmediated opposition, the mediationless

collision of opposed determinations. Here, on the one hand, mind separates itself
from nature, and yet on the other hand, falls back again into the naturalness,
since it does not yet attain actuality within itself but only in nature. In this
identity of mind with nature true freedom is impossible. Here man cannot yet
attain to consciousness of his personality, in his individuality he still has no value
and no entitlement, neither with the Indians nor the Chinese; the latter have no
compunction in exposing or simply destroying their children. 8
It is in the

Caucasian

race that mind first attains to absolute unity with itself;

here for the first time mind enters into complete opposition to naturalness, appre­
hends itself in its absolute independence, breaks free from the oscillation between
one extreme and the other, achieves self-determination, self-development, and
thereby produces world-history. The Mongols, as we have already mentioned,

43

Anthropowgy, The Soul

have for their character only the outwards-storming activity of an inundation,
which dies away as quickly as it came, acts only destructively, constructs nothing,
produces no advance in world-history. This advance comes about only through
the Caucasian race.
In the Caucasian race, however, we have to distinguish two sides, the Western
Asiatics and the Europeam; this distinction now coincides with the distinction of
Mohammedans and Christians.
In

Mohammedanism

the narrow principle of the Jews is expanded into

universality and thereby overcome. Here, God is no longer, as in the Far East,
regarded as existent in an immediately sensory way but is conceived as the

one

infinite power elevated above all the multiplicity of the world. Mohammedanism
is, therefore, in the strictest sense of the word, the religion of sublimity. The
character of the western Asiatics, particularly the Arabs, is completely in accord
with this religion. This people is, in its aspiration to the

one God,

indifferent to

everything finite, to all misery, and gives generously of its life and its goods; even
today its courage and charity earns our recognition. B ut the western Asiatic mind
which clings to the abstract One does not get as far as the determination , the
particularization, of the universal nor, consequently, to a concrete formation. By
this mind, it is true, the caste system that dominates everything in the Far East is
here annihilated, each individual among the mohammedan West Asiatics is free;
despotism proper does not occur among them. Political life, however, does not
here yet attain to an articulated organism, to the differentiation into particular
state powers. And as regards individuals they do, on the one hand, keep sublimely
aloof from subjective, finite purposes, but again, on the other hand, they also
hurl themselves with unbridled impulse into the pursuit of such purposes, which,
with them, lack all trace of the universal because here the universal does not yet
attain to an immanent particularization. So here, alongside the most sublime
sentiments, there occur the greatest vindictiveness and guile. 9

Europeam, on the contrary,

have for their principle and character the concrete

universal, the self-determining thought. The Christian God is not merely the
undifferentiated One, but the triune God who contains difference within him­
self, who has become man, who reveals himself. In this religious representation
the opposition of universal and particular, of thought and reality, has supreme
intensity and is nevertheless brought back to unity. Here, then, the particular
is not left so quiescent in its immediacy as in Mohammedanism; on the con­
trary, it is determined by thought, j ust as, conversely, the universal here develops
itself to particularization. The principle of the European mind is, therefore, self­
conscious reason, which has the confidence in itself that for it nothing can be

an

insuperable barrier, and which therefore invades everything in order to become
present to itself therein. The European mind opposes the world to itself, makes
itself free of it, but again sublates this opposition, takes its Other, the manifold,
back into itself, into its simplicity. Here, therefore, there prevails this infinite
thirst for knowledge, which is alien to the other races. The European is interested

Subjective Mind

in the world, he wants to know it, to make this Other confronting him his own,
to bring into his view the genus, the law, the universal, the thought, the inner
rationality, in the particularizations of the world. -As in the theoretical, so too
in the practical sphere, the European mind strives afi:er the unity to be produced
between itself and the external world. It subjects the external world to its ends
with an energy which has secured for it the mastery of the world. In his par­
ticular actions the individual here proceeds from firm universal principles; and
in Europe the political state exhibits more or less the unfolding and actualiza­
tion of freedom through rational institutions, exempted from the wilfulness of a
despot. 10
But finally, with regard to the original Americans, we have to remark that they
are a vanishing, feeble breed. It is true that in some parts of America at the time
of its discovery, a considerable culture was to be found; this, however, was not
comparable with European culture and has disappeared with the original inhabit­
ants. In addition, the dullest savages dwell there, e.g. the Pecherais and Eskimos.
The Caribs of earlier times are almost completely extinct. When made familiar
with brandy and fire-arms, these savages become extinct. In South America, it is
the Creoles who have made themselves independent of Spain; the Indians proper
would have been incapable of it. In Paraguay, they were j ust like small children
and were even treated as such by the Jesuits. The Americans are, therefore, clearly
not in a position to hold their own against the Europeans. The Europeans will
begin a new culture there on the soil they have conquered from the natives.

This differentiation descends into particularities, which may be termed

The racial variations depicted in the

to

are the essential

differences, the differences, determined by the concept, of the universal natural
mind. But the natural mind does not stop at this universal differentiation of itself;
the naturalness of mind does not have the power to assert itself as the pure copy
of the determinations of the concept; it proceeds to a further particularization of
these universal differences and so descends into the plurality of local or national
minds. The detailed characterization of these minds belongs partly to the nat­
ural history of man and partly to the philosophy of world-history. The former
science depicts the disposition of national character as affected by natural condi­
tions, the bodily formation, the mode of life, occupation, and also the particular
directions taken by the intelligence and the will of nations. Philosophy of his­
tory, by contrast, has as its object the world-hisrorical significance of peoples, that

Anthropology, The Soul

45

is- if w e take world-history in the most comprehensive sense o f the word- the
highest development to which the original disposition of the national character
attains, the most spiritual form to which the natural mind dwelling in the nations
ascends. Here in philosophical anthropology we cannot go into the details, the
consideration of which is the responsibility of the two sciences j ust mentioned.
We have here to consider national character only in so far as it contains the germ
from which the history of nations develops. 1
First and foremost it can be remarked that national differences are j ust as fixed
as the racial diversity of mankind, - that the Arabs, for example, still everywhere
exhibit the same characteristics as are related of them in the remotest times. The
unchangeableness of climate, of the whole character of the country in which
a nation has its permanent abode, contributes to the unchangeableness of the
national character. A desert, proximity to the sea or remoteness from it, -all
these circumstances can have an influence on the national character. Particu­
larly important in this context is the connection with the sea. In the interior of
Mrica proper, surrounded by high mountains in the coastal regions and in this
way cut off from this free element of the sea, the mind of the natives remains
closed, feels no urge to freedom and endures without resistance universal slavery.
Proximity to the sea cannot, however, of itself alone make the mind free. This
is proved by the Indians, who have slavishly submitted to the ban obtaining
among them from earliest times on sailing the sea that nature has opened to
them, and so, separated by despotism from this wide, free element, from this nat­
ural embodiment of universality, they reveal no power to free themselves from
the freedom-destroying ossification of the class divisions, which obtain in the
caste system and which would be intolerable to a nation sailing the sea on its
own initiative.2
But now as regards the determinate difference of the national minds, in the
Mrican race this is insignificant in the highest degree and even in the Asiatic
race proper it stands out much less than in Europeans, in whom the mind first
emerges from its abstract universality to the unfolded fullness of particulariza­
tion. For this reason, we propose to speak here only of the varied character of
the European nations and, among them, we will not characterize in their mutu­
al relations those peoples that are principally distinguished from each other by
their world-historical role, namely, the Greeks, the Romans, and the Germanic
peoples; this task we have to leave to the philosophy of history.We can however
indicate here the differences that have come into prominence within the Greek
nation and among the Christian peoples of Europe more or less permeated by
Germanic elements. 3
As regards the

Greeks,

the particularly outstanding peoples among them in

the period of their full world-historical development- the Lacedemonians, the
Thebans, and the Athenians-are distinguished from each other as follows.With
the Lacedemonians, the upright undifferentiated life in the ethical substance pre­
dominates: with them, therefore, property and the family relationship do not

46

Subjective Mind

receive their due. 4 With the Thebans, on the other hand, the opposite principle

emerges; with them the subjective, sentimentality, so far as the Greeks

can

yet

be credited with this at all, preponderates. The finest lyrical poet of the Greeks,
Pindar, belongs to the Thebans. The friendship-league of youths, bound to each
other in life and in death, which developed among the Thebans, also affords evid­
ence of the withdrawal into the inwardness of sentiment which prevailed among
this people.5 The Athenian people, however, display the unity of these opposites;
in them, mind has emerged from the Theban subjectivity without losing itself in
the Spartan objectivity ofethical life; with the Athenians the rights of the state and
of the individual found as perfect a unification as was possible at all at the stand­
point of the Greeks. But j ust as Athens, through this mediation of the Spartan
and Theban minds forms the unity of northern and southern Greece, so also we

see in that state the union of the eastern and western Greeks, in so far as Plato
in Athens defined the absolute as the Idea, in which both the natural element

made into the absolute in Ionian philosophy, and the wholly abstract thought
forming the principle of Italic philosophy, are reduced to moments. With these
intimations regarding the character of the principal peoples of Greece we must
be content here; to develop further what has been intimated would encroach on
the territory of world-history and especially of the history of philosophy too.6

An even greater diversity of national character is to be seen in the

Christian

peoples of Europe. The fundamental determination in the nature of these peoples
is the predominant inwardness, the subjectivity firm within itself. This is mod­

ified mainly according to the southern or northern situation of the countries
inhabited by these peoples. In the south, individuality uninhibitedly emerges in
its idiosyncrasy. This is especially true of the

Italians;

with them the individual

character will not be other than j ust what it is; universal purposes do not disturb

its uninhibitedness.7 Such a character is more appropriate to the feminine nature
than to the masculine. Italian individuality has, therefore, flowered into its finest
beauty in feminine individuality; not infrequently Italian women and maidens,
who were unhappy in love, have died of grief in a

single instant;

so much had

their whole nature entered into the individual relationship, whose breaking-off
annihilated them. Connected with this uninhibitedness of individuality is also
the strong gesticulation of the Italians; their mind spills over without reserve into
its bodiliness. The charm of their behaviour has the same ground. The same pre­
dominance of idiosyncracy, of the individual also shows itself in the political life
of the Italians. Even before the Roman domination as well as after its disappear­
ance, we see Italy disintegrated into a collection of small states. In the Middle
Ages we see there the many individual communities everywhere so torn by fac­
tions that half of the citizens of such states almost always lived in exile. The
general interest of the state could not prevail over the predominant party spirit.
The individuals who set themselves up as the sole representatives of the com­

monweal, themselves pursued mainly their own ends, and sometimes in the most
tyrannical, cruel manner. Neither in these autocracies nor in the republics torn

47

Anthropology, The Soul

by party conflict could political right develop into a firm, rational structure. Only
Roman civil law was studied and set up as a makeshift barrier against the tyranny
alike of individuals and of the many.
With the

Spaniards

similarly we find the predominance of individuality; but

this does not have the Italian uninhibitedness but is already associated more with
reflection. The individual content which is here assened already bears the form of
universality. That is why we see honour in panicular to be the driving principle
with Spaniards. Here the individual demands recognition, not in his immediate
idiosyncracy, but on account of the agreement of his actions and conduct with
cenain fixed principles which, according to the conception of the nation, must
be law for every man of honour. But since the Spaniard is guided in all his activ­
ity by these principles which transcend the whims of the individual and have not
yet been undermined by the sophistry of the intellect, he attains to greater stead­
fastness than the Italian, who obeys more the inspirations of the moment and
lives more in sentiment than in firm representations. This difference between the
two peoples is specially prominent in connection with religion . The Italian does
not let religious scruples especially interfere with his cheerful enjoyment of life.
The Spaniard, on the other hand, has hitheno adhered with fanatical zeal to the
letter of Catholic doctrine and for centuries, through the Inquisition, has perse­
cuted with African inhumanity those suspected of deviating from this letter.8 In
a political connection too the two peoples differ in a manner that accords with
the character attributed to them. Italian national unity, which Petrarch already
ardently wished for, is today still a dream; this land is still split up into a collection
of states which trouble themselves very little about each other. In Spain, on the
contrary, where as we have said, the universal attains to some degree of mastery
over the individual, the individual states which formerly subsisted in that coun­
try have already been welded into a single state, though the provinces indeed still
seek to assen too great a measure of independence.
Now whereas with the Italians mobility of sentiment predominates, and in
Spaniards firmness of representative thinking, the

French display both

firmness

of intellect and mobility of wit. The French have always been reproached with
frivolity, also with vanity, the desire to please. But through striving to please,
they have brought social culture to an extreme of refinement and by vinue of
j ust this have raised themselves in a remarkable way above the crude selfishness
of the natural man; for this culture consists precisely in not forgetting the oth­
ers, with whom one is dealing, in favour of oneself, but in taking them into
account and showing oneself well disposed towards them. Both to the individual
and to the public, the French- be they statesmen, artists, or scholars- accord
the most respectful attention in all their actions and works. Yet occasionally this
deference to the opinion of others has of course degenerated into the effon to
please at all costs, even at the expense of truth. This striving has also given rise
to ideal chatterboxes. But what the French regard as the surest means of giving
universal pleasure is what they call

esprit.

This

esprit is

restricted in superficial

Subjective Mind

48

natures to associating ideas only remotely connected, but in intelligent men, such
as Montesquieu and Voltaire for example,

esprit becomes,

by bringing together

what the intellect has separated, a brilliant form of the rational; for the essen­
tial feature of the rational is j ust to bring together what is separated. But this
form of the rational is still not that of conceptual cognition; the profound, clever
thoughts which are to be found in abundance in men like those we have men­
tioned, are not developed from

one universal

thought, from the concept of the

subject-matter, but are thrown out like flashes of lightning.9 The acuteness of
the French intellect is revealed in the clarity and determinacy of expression, in
speech and writings alike. Their rigorously rule-governed language corresponds
to the orderliness and conciseness of their thoughts. The French have thereby
become models of political and j uristic exposition. But in their political dealings,
too, one cannot fail to detect the acuteness of their intellect. In the midst of the
storm of revolutionaty passion, their intellect showed itself in the decisiveness
with which they succeeded in producing the new ethical world-order in face of
the powerful alliance of the numerous adherents of the old order, actualizing one
a&er another all moments of the new political life to be developed, in their most
extreme determinacy and opposition. Just because they pushed these moments to
the limit of one-sidedness, pursued each one-sided political principle to its ulti­
mate consequences, they have been brought by the dialectic of world-historical
reason to a political condition in which all the previous one-sidednesses in the life
of the state appear sublated. 1 0
The English could b e called the people o f intellectual intuition. They recognize
the rational less in the form of universality than in that of individuality. Thus
their poets rank far higher than their philosophers. Originality of personality is
a vety prominent feature with the English. But their originality is not naive and
natural, but stems from thought, from the will. In this the individual wills to
be self-dependent in evety respect, to relate to the universal only by way of his
idiosyncracy. For this reason, political freedom with the English mainly takes
the form of privileges, of rights which are traditional, not derived from univer­
sal thoughts. The sending of deputies to Parliament by the individual English
municipalities and counties is everywhere based on particular privileges, not on
universal principles consistently carried out. Certainly the Englishman is proud
of the honour and freedom of his whole nation, but his national pride is foun­
ded mainly on the consciousness that in England the individual can retain and
exercise his particularity. Associated with this tenacity of individuality, which,
though pursuing the universal, in its relation with the universal holds fast to itself,
is the conspicuous aptitude of the English for trade. 1 1
The

Germans

usually think o f the Germans last, either from modesty or

because one saves the best till the end. We have the reputation of being
profound, though not infrequently obscure, thinkers; we aim at comprehending
the innermost nature of things and their necessary connection; therefore, we go

49

Anthropology, The Soul

extremely systematically to work in science, only in doing so we occasionally
lapse into the formalism of an external, arbitrary construction. Our mind, more
than that of any other European nation, is in general turned inwards. We prefer
to live in the inwardness of emotion and of thinking. In this still life, in this
hermit-like solitude of spirit, we first busy ourselves before we act with carefully
determining the principles on which we propose to act. That is why we are
somewhat slow in proceeding to action, occasionally, in cases which demand
a quick decision, remain undecided and with the sincere wish to do the thing
really well, often fail to achieve anything at all . The French proverb,

tue le bien,

can

le meilleur

therefore rightly be applied to the Germans. Everything that

is supposed to be done must, with the Germans, be justified by grounds. But
since grounds

can

be found for everything, this justification often becomes mere

formalism, in which the universal thought of right does not reach its immanent
development but remains an abstraction into which the particular arbitrarily
intrudes from outside. 1 2 This formalism has also shown itself in the Germans
in the circumstance that they have sometimes been content for centuries to
preserve certain political rights merely by protestations. l 3 But while in this way
the subjects accomplished very little for themselves, on the other hand they often
did extremely lirtle for the government. Living in the inwardness of emotion, the
Germans have indeed always liked to speak of their loyalty and integrity; often,
however, this substantial disposition of theirs could not be put to the test; on the
contrary, they have, without misgivings and regardless of their excellent opinion
of their loyalty and integrity, used the general statutory codes against prince and
emperor, merely to conceal their disinclination to do something for the state.
But although their political spirit, their patriotism, was mostly not very lively, yet
from early times they have been animated by an inordinate desire for the honour
of an official post and have been of the opinion that office and title make the
man, that the importance of persons and the respect due to them could in almost
every case be measured with perfect certainty by the difference of title. This has
made the Germans so ridiculous that the only parallel to be found in Europe is
the Spaniard's mania for a long string of names.

§395

The soul is differentiated into the

individual subject.

But this subjectivity

comes into consideration here only as an individualization of natural determinacy.
This determinacy becomes the

mode of the

varying temperament, talent, char­

acter, physiognomy, and other dispositions and idiosyncrasies, in families or in
single individuals.

Zusatz. As we have seen, the natural mind first divides up into the universal differ­

ences of the races of mankind, and reaches, in the minds of peoples, a difference

that has the form of particularization. The third stage is that the natural mind

50

Subjective Mind

proceeds to its individualization, and as individual soul opposes itself to itself. But
the opposition arising here is not yet the opposition which belongs to the essence
of consciousness. Here in anthropology the singularity or individuality of the soul
comes into account only as a natural determinacy. 1
Now first of all we must remark that it is in the individual soul that the sphere
of the contingent begins, for only the universal is the necessary. Individual souls
are distinguished from each other by an infinite number of contingent modi­
fications. But this infinity belongs to the bad kind of infinite. One should not
therefore rate the peculiarity of people too highly. On the contrary, the assertion
that the teacher should carefully adjust himself to the individuality of each of
his pupils, studying and developing it, must be proclaimed to be a piece of idle
prattle that leads up the garden path. The teacher has simply no time for this. The
peculiarity of children is tolerated within the family circle; but at school begins a
life subject to universal regulations, to a rule common to all; at school the mind
must be induced to lay aside its idiosyncrasies, to know and to will the univer­
sal, to accept the current universal culture. This reshaping of the soul, this alone
is what education means. The more cultivated a man is, the less his behaviour
exhibits anything peculiar only to him, anything therefore contingent. 2
Now the peculiarity of the individual has various aspects. These are distin­
guished as the determinations ofpredisposition, temperament, and character.
By predisposition is understood the natural aptitudes of a man in contrast to
what he has become by his own activity.3 These aptitudes include talent and
genius. Both words express a definite direction which the individual mind has
been given by nature. Genius, however, is wider in scope than talent; talent pro­
duces novelty only in the province of the particular, whereas genius creates a
new genre. But since talent and genius are initially mere aptitudes, they must
be developed-if they are not to go to waste, to decay, to degenerate into bad
originality-by universally valid procedures. Only by such development do these
aptitudes demonstrate their presence, their power and their range. Before such
development one can be deceived about the reality of a talent; an early occu­
pation with painting, for example, may seem to betray talent for this art and
yet this hobby may come to nothing. Mere talent is, therefore, not to be val­
ued more highly than reason which by its own activity has come to knowledge
of its concept, -than absolutely free thinking and willing. In philosophy, mere
genius does not get one very far; here it must submit to the strict discipline of
logical thinking; it is only by this submission that genius there achieves its com­
plete freedom.4 As regards the will, however, one cannot say that there is a genius
for virtue; for virtue is something universal, to be required of all men and nothing
innate but something to be produced in the individual by his own activity. Dif­
ferences in predisposition have, therefore, no importance whatever for the theory
of virtue; they would come into consideration, if we may so express ourselves,
only in a natural history of mind. 5

Anthropology, The Soul

51

The various kinds of talent and genius are distinguished from each other by
the different realms of mind in which they operate. Difference of temperaments,
by contrast, has no such relation outwards. It is difficult to say what is meant
by temperament. Temperament does not relate to the ethical nature of action,
nor to the talent revealed in the action, nor finally to passion, which always
has a determinate content. It is therefore best to define temperament as the
entirely universal mode and manner in which the individual is active, objectifies
himself, maintains himself in actuality.6 From this definition it emerges that
for the free mind, temperament is not so important as was formerly supposed.
In a time of greater cultivation, the various contingent mannerisms of conduct
and action disappear, and with them the varieties of temperament, in just
the same way that, in such a time, the restricted characters in comedies
of a less cultivated epoch-the completely frivolous, the ridiculously absent­
minded, the stingy misers-become much rarer. The attempts to distinguish
between temperaments involve such indeterminacy that one hardly knows how
to apply them to individuals, since the temperaments portrayed separately are,
in individuals, found more or less combined with each other. Just as virtue was
distinguished into four cardinal virtues, so too, as we know, four temperaments
were assumed: the choleric, the sanguine, the phlegmatic, and the melancholic.
Kant has a great deal to say about them. The main difference between these
temperaments is based on whether someone devotes himself to the matter in
hand or whether he is more concerned with his own individuality. The former
case occurs with the sanguine and phlegmatic, the latter with the choleric
and melancholic. The sanguine individual forgets himself in what he is doing,
and more specifically in such way that by virtue of his superficial versatility,
he gets involved in a variety of concerns; the phlegmatic individual, on the
contrary, steadfastly applies himself to one concern. But in the choleric and the
melancholic, as we have already indicated, close attachment to subjectivity is
predominant; however, these two temperaments are in turn distinguished from
each other by the fact that in the choleric, versatility predominates, and in
the melancholic, inertia; so that in this connection the choleric temperament
corresponds to the sanguine and the melancholic to the phlegmatic.7
We have already remarked that difference of temperament loses its import­
ance in a period when the mode and manner of conduct and of the activity of
individuals is established by the universal culture. Character, on the other hand,
remains something which always differentiates people. Only by character does
the individual attain his stable determinacy. Character requires, firstly, a form­
al element, the energy with which a man, withour letting himself be diverted,
pursues his aims and interests and in all his actions preserves his harmony with
himself. Without character a man does not emerge from his indeterminacy or he
slides from one direction to the opposite. Every human being should therefore be
required to show character. A man with character impresses others because they

52

Subjective Mind

know the kind of man they are dealing with. But besides formal energy character
requires, secondly, a substantial, universal content of the will. Only by carrying
out great aims does a man reveal a great character, making him a beacon for
others; and his aims must be inwardly justified if his character is to exhibit the
absolute unity of the content and the formal activity of the will and thus to have
complete truth. If, on the contrary, the will clings to mere details, to the insub­
stantial, then it becomes obstinacy. Obstinacy has only the form, not the content,
of character. Through obstinacy, this parody of character, the individuality of a
man is accentuated to a point where it spoils companionship with others. 8
Of a still more individual kind are the so-called

idiosyncrasies, which occur both

in the physical and in the mental nature of man. Some people, for example, scent
the presence of cats near them. Others are quite peculiarly affected by cenain dis­
eases. King James I of England fainted if he saw a rapier. Mental idiosyncrasies are
displayed especially in youth, e.g. in the incredible rapidity of mental arithmetic
in panicular children. Incidentally, it is not merely individuals who are distin­

guished from each other by the forms of mind's natural determinacy discussed
above, but to some extent families too, especially when they have intermarried
among themselves and not with outsiders, as has been the case, for example, in
Bern and in quite a few of the free German cities.9
Now that we have depicted the three forms of the qualitative natural determ­
inacy of the individual soul- predisposition, temperament, and character-we
have still to indicate the rational necessity for the fact that this natural determin­
acy has j ust these three forms and no others, and for the fact that these forms are
to be considered in the order we have followed. We began with predisposition,
more specifically with talent and genius, because in the predisposition the qual­
itative natural determinacy of the individual soul has predominantly the form
of something that merely is, something immediately fixed and of such a son
that its differentiation within itself is related to a difference present outside it.
In temperament, on the other hand, this natural determinacy loses the shape
of something so fixed; for whereas either one talent prevails exclusively in the
individual, or several talents subsist alongside each other in him quiescently and
without passing into each other, one and the same individual

can

pass over from

any temperamental mood into another, so that no temperamental mood has a
fixed being in him. At the same time in temperaments the difference of the nat­
ural determinacy in question is reflected out of the relation to something present
outside the individual soul into the interior of the soul. But in character we see
the fixity of the predisposition united with the changeableness of the tempera­
mental moods, the predominant relation to the outside in the predisposition,
united with the reflectedness-into-self of the soul prevailing in the temperamental
moods. The fixity of character is not so immediate, not so innate, as the fixity of
predisposition, but has to be developed by the will. Character consists in some­
thing more than an even blending of the various temperaments. All the same, it

Anthropology, The Soul

53

cannot be denied that it has a natural foundation, that some people are more nat­
urally prone to a strong character than others. For this reason, we had the right to
speak of character here in Anthropology, although it is only in the sphere of free
mind that it obtains its full unfolding. 1 0

(�) Natural Alterations
§396
In the soul determined as an individual, the differences take the form of alter­
ations in it, in the single subject persisting in the alterations, and of moments in
its development. As they are at once physical and mental differences, a concrete
definition or description of them would require us to anticipate an acquaintance
with the cultivated mind. 1
[Remark] ( 1 ) The first type of alteration is the natural course of the ages of life.
It begins with the child, the mind wrapped up in itself. The next step is the
developed opposition, the tension between a universality which is still subject­
ive (ideals, imaginings, moral demands, hopes, etc.) and immediate individuality,
i.e. both the existing world, which fails to meet the ideals, and the position in it
of the individual himself, who, in his current state, still lacks independence and
intrinsic maturity (the youth) . Next there is the genuine relationship: recognition
of the objective necessity and rationality of the world as we find it, a world no
longer incomplete, but able, in the work which it accomplishes in and for itself,
to afford the individual a share and a confirmation for his activity. This makes
the individual somebody, with actual presence and objective value (the man) . Last
of all comes the completion of the unity with this objectivity: a unity which,
while in its reality it passes into the inertia of deadening habit, in its ideality gains
freedom from the limited interests and entanglements of the external present

(oldage) .2
Zusatz. When the soul, which at first is completely universal, particularizes itself
in the way we have indicated and finally determines itself to singularity, to indi­
viduality, it enters into opposition to its inner universality, to its substance. This
contradiction between the immediate individuality and the substantial universal­
ity implicitly present in it, establishes the life-process of the individual soul, a pro­
cess by which the immediate individuality of the soul is brought into conformity
with the universal, the universal is actualized in the soul and thus the initial,
simple unity of the soul with itself is raised to a unity mediated by the oppos­
ition, and the initially abstract universality of the soul is developed to concrete
universality.3 This process of development is education. Even merely animal life
in its way exhibits this process implicitly. But, as we saw earlier, it does not have
the power genuinely to actualize the genus within itself; its immediate, abstract
individuality, an individuality that simply is, always remains in contradiction

54

Subjective Mind

with its genus, both excluding it from itself and including it within itself. By
this inability to exhibit the genus perfecdy, the mere living creature perishes. In
the animal, the genus proves to be a power in face of which the animal must
pass away. Therefore, in the death of the individual, the genus attains an actu­
alization which is j ust as abstract as the individuality of merely animal life and
excludes that individuality j ust as much as the genus remains excluded from the
living individuality.4-The genus genuinely actualizes itself, on the other hand,
in mind, in thinking, in this element which is homogeneous with the genus. But
in the anthropological sphere this actualization, since it takes place in the nat­
ural individual mind, still has the mode of naturalness. Consequently it falls into
time. Thus arises a series of distinct states through which the individual as such
passes, a sequence of differences which no longer have the fixity of the immedi­
ate differences of the universal natural mind which prevail in the various races of
mankind and in the national minds, but appear in one and the same individual as
transient forms, passing into each other.s
This sequence of distinct states is the series of the ages oflife.
It begins with the immediate, still undifferentiated unity of the genus and the
individuality, with the abstract emergence of the immediate individuality, with
the birth of the individual, and ends with the impression of the genus into the
individuality, or of the individuality into the genus, with the victory of the genus
over the individuality, with the abstract negation of the individuality, -with
death.6
What the genus is in life as such,

rationality

is in the realm of mind; for the

genus already has inner universality, the determination pertaining to the ration­
al. This unity of the genus and the rational explains why the mental phenomena
appearing in the course of the ages of life correspond to the physical alterations
that also develop in the course of the individual's life. The agreement of the
mental and the physical is here more determinate than in the case of racial dif­
ferences, where we have to do only with the universal fixed differences of the
natural mind and with the equally fixed physical differences of men, whereas
here the determinate alterations of the individual soul and of its bodiliness are
under consideration. But, on the other hand, we must not go so far as to look for
the marked counterpart of the individual's mental unfolding in his physiological
development; for in the former, the opposition emerging in it and the unity to
be engendered from that opposition, have a far higher significance than in the
physiological sphere. Mind here reveals its independence of its bodiliness in the
fact that it can develop earlier than the body. Children have often shown a mental
development far in advance of their physical maturity. This has mainly occurred
with outstanding artistic talents, especially musical geniuses. Such precocity is
not infrequendy shown too in connection with an easy assimilation of various
kinds of information, especially in the field of mathematics, and also in connec­
tion with intellectual argumentation, even on ethical and religious themes. In
general, however, it must be admitted that the intellect does not come before its

Anthropology, The Soul

55

time. I t i s almost solely i n the case o f artistic talents that their premature appear­
ance has indicated excellence. On the other hand, the premature development
of intelligence generally observed in several children has not, as a rule, been the
inception of a mind attaining great distinction in manhood. 7
Now the process of development of the natural human individual splits up
into a series of processes whose difference rests on the different relationship of
the individual to the genus and establishes the difference between the child, the
man, and the elderly. These differences are presentations of the differences of the
concept. Childhood is, therefore, the time of natural harmony, of the peace of
the individual with himself and with the world,- the oppositionless beginning,
just as old age is the oppositionless end. The oppositions which may emerge in
childhood remain without deeper interest. The child lives in innocence, without
lasting pain, in the love it has for its parents and in the feeling of being loved
by them. This immediate and therefore unspiritual, purely natural unity of the
individual with its genus and with the world generally, must be sublated; the
individual must advance to-the point where he opposes himself to the universal as
the finished and subsisting substance that is in and for itself, to the point where he
apprehends himself in his independence. But this independence, this opposition,
at first appears in just as one-sided a shape as does the unity of the subjective and
the objective in the child. The youth dissects the Idea actualized in the world, in
the following manner: to himself he ascribes the true and the good, the determ­
ination of the substantial which belongs to the nature of the Idea; to the world,
by contrast, he ascribes the determination of the contingent, accidental. We can­
not come to a standstill at this untrue opposition; the youth must rise above it to
the insight that, on the contrary, the world is to be viewed as the substantial, and
the individual by contrast only as an accident, - that therefore man can find his
essential activity and satisfaction only in the world that pursues its steady course
independently in face of him, and that for this reason he must acquire the skill
necessary for the substance. -Reaching this standpoint, the youth has become
a man. Complete within himself, the man views the ethical world-order too as
an order that does not first need to be produced by him, but as essentially com­
plete. Thus he is active for, not against, the substance, he has an interest for the
substance, not against it, he has thus risen above the one-sided subjectivity of
youth to the standpoint of objective mindfulness. - Old age, by contrast, is the
return to a lack of interest in things� the old man has lived his way into things and
just because of this unity with things, in which the opposition is lost, he aban­
dons active interest in things.s-We now propose to determine in more detail
the differences of the ages of man that we have thus indicated in general.
Childhood we can differentiate again into three stages, or if we wish to include
in the sphere of our treatment the unborn child which is identical with its
mother, into four stages.
The unborn child has as yet no proper individuality, no individuality to enter
into relationship with particular objects in a particular manner or to draw in an

Subjective Mind

56

external thing at a determinate point of its organism. The life of the unborn child
resembles the life of a plant. Just as a plant has no interrupted intussusception but
a continuous stream of nutriment, so too the child feeds at first by a continual
sucking and as yet possesses no interrupted respiration.
When the child is brought into the world out of this vegetative state in which
it resides in the womb, it passes into the animal mode of life. Birth is, therefore,
a tremendous leap. By it the child emerges from the state of a completely oppos­
itionless life into the state of separation , - into the relationship to light and air
and into a continually developing relationship to individualized objects in gener­
al and especially to individualized nourishment. The first way in which the child
establishes its independence is

breathing, the inhalation and exhalation of air at an

individual point of its body, a process that interrupts the elemental flow. Imme­
diately after the binh of the child, its body already shows itself as almost fully
organized; only single details alter in it. Thus, for example, the so-called fora­

men ovale closes

up only later. The main alteration in the child's body consists

in growth. In connection with this alteration it is hardly necessary to recall that
in animal life generally, in contrast to vegetable life, growth is not a coming-out­

of-itself, not an extrusion beyond itself, not a production of new structures, but
is only a development of the organism and produces merely quantitative, form­
al difference, which relates both to the degree of strength and to the extension.
Nor do we need here (what has already been done in the appropriate place in the
philosophy of nature) to explain at length that the completeness of bodily struc­
ture which is lacking in the plant and first comes about in the animal organism,
this leading back of all the members to the negative, simple unity of life, is the
basis of the self-feeling that arises in the animal, and therefore also in the child.9
We must emphasize here however that in man the animal organism reaches its
most perfect form. Even the most complete animal is unable to exhibit this del­
icately organized, infinitely pliable body which we already discern in the newly
born child. At first, however, the child appears in a far greater dependency and
need than animals. Yet in this, too, its higher nature already reveals itself. At
once need announces itself in unruly, stormy, and peremptory fashion. Where­
as the animal is silent or expresses its pain only by groaning, the child expresses
the feeling of its needs by

screaming.

By this ideal activiry the child shows that

it is straightaway imbued with the cenainty that it has a right to demand from
the external world the satisfaction of its needs, - that the independence of the
external world in face of man is void. 1 0

Now as regards the mental development o f the child i n this first stage of its

life, it can be said that man never learns more than in this period. Here the child
makes itself gradually familiar with all specifications of the sensory. The external
world now becomes an actuality for it. It progresses from sensation to intuition.
Initially the child has only a sensation of light by which things are manifest to it.
This mere sensation misleads the child into reaching out for something distant as
if it were near. But through the sense of feeling the child orientates itself in regard

Anthropology, The Soul

57

to distances. Thus it gains an eye for distance, in general it casts the external out
of itself. In this period, too, the child learns that external things offer resistance. 1 1
The transition from childhood to boyhood is to b e located in the development
of the child's activity towards the external world; the child, in gaining a feeling of
the actuality of the external world, begins to become an actual human being itself
and to feel itself as such; but in doing so it passes on to the practical tendency
to put itself to the test in this actuality. The child is equipped for this practical
response by growing teeth, by learning to stand, to walk, and to speak. The first
thing to be learnt here is to stand upright. This is peculiar to man and can only be
effected by his will; a man stands only in so far as he wills to stand; as soon as we
no longer will to stand, we collapse; standing is, therefore, the habit of the will to
stand. Man acquires an even freer relationship to the external world by walking;
by this he sublates the asunderness of space and gives himself his own place. But
speech enables man to apprehend things as universal, to attain to the conscious­
ness of his own universality, to the enunciation of the I. This apprehension of its
1-hood is a supremely important point in the mental development of the child; at
this point it begins to reflect itself into itself out of its immersion in the external
world. Initially this incipient independence expresses itself in the child's learning
to play with sensory things. But the most rational thing that children can do with
their toys is to break them. 1 2
In passing from play to the serious business of learning, the child becomes a
boy. At this stage children start to become inquisitive, especially for stories; what
they have to deal with is ideas that do not present themselves to them in an imme­
diate way. But here the main thing is the awakening feeling in them that they are
not yet what they ought to be, -and the lively wish to become as the adults are,
in whose environment they are living. This wish gives rise to the imitativeness of
children. Whereas the feeling of immediate unity with the parents is the spiritual
mother's milk on which children thrive, the children's own need to grow up is
what makes them grow up. This striving after education on the part of children
themselves is the immanent moment of all education. But since the boy is still at
the standpoint of immediacy, the higher level to which he is to ascend appears
to him, not in the form of universality or of the substance, but in the shape of a
given, of an individual, an authority. It is this or that man who forms the ideal
which the boy strives to know and to imitate; at this standpoint the child intuits
its own essence only in this concrete manner. What the boy has to learn must
therefore be given to him on and with authority; he has the feeling that what is
thus given to him is higher than himself. This feeling must be carefully fostered
in education. Thus we must brand as a complete perversion the playful pedagogy,
which wants to see serious matters delivered to children as play and demands that
the educator should lower himself to the childish mentality of the pupils instead
of raising them to the seriousness of the substance. This playful education can
have the consequence that for his whole life the boy treats everything with a dis­
dainful attitude. Such a regrettable result can also be introduced by constantly

Subjective Mind

58

inciting children to argumentation, as intellectually deficient pedagogues recom­
mend; by this children easily acquire a bit of impudence. The children's own
thinking must, of course, be aroused; but the dignity of the substance should not
be put at the mercy of their immature, vain intellect. B
With regard to one of the two aspects of education,

discipline,

the boy should

not be allowed to follow his own inclination; he must obey in order to learn to
command. Obedience is the beginning of all wisdom; for through obedience the
will that does not yet know the true, the obj ective, that does not make this its goal
and therefore far from being genuinely independent and free is still immature,
accepts within itself the rational will coming to it from outside and gradually
makes this its own will. On the other hand, if one allows children to do as they
please, if one commits the additional folly of handing over to them reasons for
their whims, then one falls into the worst mode of education, children develop
a deplorable absorption in panicular likes and dislikes, in peculiar cleverness, in
self-centred interest, - the root of all evil. By nature, the child is neither evil nor
good, since it starts without any knowledge either of good or of evil. To regard
this unknowing innocence as an ideal and to yearn to return to it would be silly; it
is without value and of shon duration. Self-will and evil soon emerge in the child.
This self-will must be broken by discipline, this seed of evil must be annihilated
by it. I 4
With regard t o the other side of education,

instruction,

i t i s t o b e noted that

this rationally begins with the most abstract thing that the child's mind can grasp.
This is the alphabet. This presupposes an abstraction to which entire races, for
example, even the Chinese, have not attained. Language in general is this airy
element, this sensory-unsensory, by increasing knowledge of which the child's
mind rises more and more above the sensory, the individual, to the universal, to
thinking. This growing capacity for thinking is the greatest benefit of primary
education. But the child only gets as far as

representational thinking;

the world is

only for his representation; he learns the qualities of things, becomes acquainted
with the circumstances of the worlds of nature and mind, develops an interest
in things, but does not yet cognize the world in its inner connectedness. This
knowledge comes only with manhood. But it cannot be denied that the boy has
an imperfect understanding of the natural and the mental. One must therefore
describe as an error the claim that a boy as yet understands nothing whatever of
religion and right, that therefore he must not be bothered with these matters,
that on no account must ideas be forced on him, but on the contrary he must
be provided with experiences of his own and one must be content to let him be
stimulated by what is sensorily present. Even the ancients did not allow children
to dwell for long on the sensory. But the modern mind involves a wholly differ­
ent elevation above the sensory, a much deeper absorption in its own inwardness ,
than the ancient mind. Therefore, the supersensory world should now be presen­
ted to the boy's imagination at an early age. This happens in a much higher
degree through the

school than

in the family. In the family the child is accepted

Anthropology, The Soul

59

in its immediate individuality, is loved whether its behaviour is good or bad. In
school, on the other hand, the immediacy of the child no longer counts; here it
is esteemed only according to its worth, according to its achievements; here it is
no longer merely loved but criticized and guided in accordance with universal
determinations, moulded by the objects of instruction according to fixed rules,
in general, subjected to a universal order which forbids much that is innocent
in itself, because it cannot be permitted that evetyone does it. The school thus
forms the transition from the family into civil society. But to civil society the boy
has at first only an indeterminate relationship; his interest is still divided between
learning and playing. I 5
The boy matures into a youth, when with the onset o f puberty the life o f the
genus begins to stir in him and to seek satisfaction. The youth turns, in general,
to the substantial universal; his ideal no longer appears to him, as it does to the
boy, in the person of a man, but is conceived by him as a universal, independent
of such individuality. But in the youth this ideal still has a more or less subjective
shape, whether it lives in him as an ideal of love and friendship or as an ideal of a
universal state of the world. In this subjectivity of the substantial content of such
an ideal lies not only its opposition to the current world, but also the urge to sub­
late this opposition by actualizing the ideal. The content of the ideal instills into
the youth the feeling of energy; he therefore fancies himselfcalled and qualified to
transform the world, or at least to readjust the world that seems to him to be out
of joint. That the substantial universal contained in his ideal has, in keeping with
its essence, already attained to development and actualization in the world, is not
discerned by the zealous mind of the youth. To him the actualization of that uni­
versal seems a lapse from it. Therefore he feels that both his ideal and his own
personality are not recognized by the world Thus the peace in which the child
lives with the world is broken by the youth. Because of this direction towards the
ideal, youth has the semblance of a nobler sense and greater selflessness than is
seen in the man, who attends to his particular, temporal interests. As against this,
it must be pointed out that the man is no longer wrapped up in his particular
impulses and subjective views and occupied only with his personal development;
on the contraty, he has plunged into the reason of actuality and proves himself
active for the world. The youth necessarily arrives at this goal. His immediate aim
is to cultivate himself in order to equip himself for the actualization of his ideals.
In attempting this actualization he becomes a man. 16
At first, the transition from his ideal life into civil society can appear to the
youth as a painful transition into the life of the philistine. The youth, who
hitherto has been occupied only with universal objects and has worked only for
himself, now that he is growing into manhood and entering into practical life,
must be active for others and attend to individual details. Now, however much
this lies in the nature of things-since if one is to act, one must get down to
the individual case-, the occupation with details can at first be vety distressing
to a human being, and the impossibility of an immediate actualization of his

60

Subjective Mind

ideals can make him hypochondriac. This hypochondria, however inconspicuous
it may be in many cases, is not easy for anyone to escape. The later the age at
which it attacks a man, the more serious are its symptoms. In weak natures it
can persist throughout the entire lifetime. In this diseased mood the man will
not give up his subjectivity, is unable to overcome his aversion to actuality, and
by this very fact resides in a state of relative incapacity which easily becomes an
actual incapacity. If, therefore, the man does not want to perish, then he must
recognize the world as an independent, essentially complete world, accept the
conditions set for him by it and wrest from its obduracy what he wills to have
for himself. As a rule, the man believes that he must agree to this compliance
only from necessity. But, in truth, this unity with the world must be recognized
not as a relationship of necessity, but as the rational relationship. The rational,
the divine, possesses the absolute power to actualize itself and has, right from
the beginning, fulfilled itself; it is not so impotent that it would have to wait
for the beginning of its actualization. The world is this actualization of divine
reason; it is only on its surface that the play of contingencies prevails. The
world can lay claim, therefore, with at least as much right as the individual
becoming a man, indeed with even greater right, to be regarded as complete and
independent; and therefore the man acts entirely rationally in abandoning his
plan for a complete transformation of the world and in striving to actualize his
personal aims, passions, and interests only in his connection to the world. Even
so, this leaves him scope for an honourable, far-reaching and creative activity.
For although the world must be recognized as essentially complete, yet it is not
a dead, absolutely inert world but, like the life-process, a world that perpetually
produces itself anew, a world that, in simply preserving itself, at the same rime
progresses. It is in this preserving production and continuance of the world that
the man's work consists. Therefore, on the one hand we can say that the man
only produces what is already there. Yet on the other hand, his activity must
also bring about an advance. But the world's progress occurs only on the large
scale and is only noticeable in a great sum total of what has been produced.
If the man after a labour of fifty years looks back on his past, he will already
recognize the progress. This knowledge, as well as insight into the rationality of
the world, liberates him from sorrow over the destruction of his ideals. What
is true in these ideals is preserved in the practical activity; what the man must
work out of his system is only what is untrue, the empty abstractions. The scope
and type of his business can vary considerably; but the substantial element in
all human occupations is the same, namely, the lawful, the ethical, and the
religious. Therefore, people can find satisfaction and honour in all spheres of
their practical activity if they accomplish all that is rightly required of them in
the particular sphere to which they belong by chance, external necessity, or free
choice. For this it is necessary above all things that the education of the youth
coming to manhood be completed, that he has finished his studies, and secondly,
that he resolve to provide for his own subsistence by beginning to become active

Anthropology, The Soul

61

on behalf of others. Education alone does not make him a completely mature
man; he becomes this only through his own intelligent concern for his temporal
interests; just as peoples only come of age when they have reached the point
where they are not excluded by a so-called paternal government from looking
after their material and spiritual interests.l7
When the man now passes into practical life, he may well be vexed and morose
about the state of the world and lose hope of any improvement; but in spite of
this he finds his place in objective conditions and becomes habituated to them
and to his occupation. The objects with which he has to occupy himself are, it
is true, individual, changeable, in their peculiarity more or less new. But at the
same time, these individual details contain a universal, a rule, something law­
ful. The longer the man is now active in his occupation, the more this universal
emerges out of all the particularities. In this way he gets to be completely at home
in his field, to immerse himself thoroughly in his destiny. The essential element
in all the objects of his occupation is then entirely familiar to him and only the
individual, the inessential can occasionally present him with something new. By
the very fact, however, that his activity has become so completely appropriate to
his business, that his activity no longer meets with any resistance in its objects,
precisely by this completed cultivation of his activity, the vitality of the activity
expires; for the interest of the subject in the object disappears together with the
opposition between the subject and the object. Thus by the habit of mental life,
as well as by the dulling of the activity of his physical organism, the man becomes
an old man. 1 8
The old man lives without any definite interest, for h e has abandoned the hope
of actualizing the ideals he cherished earlier and the future seems to promise him
nothing new at all; on the contrary, he believes that he already knows the uni­
versal, the essential in anything he may still encounter. The mind of the old man
is thus turned only towards this universal and to the past to which he owes the
knowledge of this universal. But in thus living in recollection of the past and
of the substantial, he loses his memory for details of the present and for what
is arbitrary, names for example, in the same measure that, conversely, he firmly
retains in his mind the wise teachings of experience and feels obliged to preach to
those younger than himself. But this wisdom, this lifeless, complete coincidence
of subjective activity with its world, leads back to oppositionless childhood, in
the same way that the growth of the activity of his physical organism into a static
habit leads on to the abstract negation of the living individuality, to death. 19
The course of the ages of man's life thus rounds itself off into a concept­
determined totality of alterations which are produced by the interaction of the
genus with the individuality.
A1; in the description of the racial varieties of mankind and in the characteriza­
tion of the national mind, here too, in order to speak in a determinate way about
the course of the ages of life of the human individual, we have had to anticipate
a knowledge of what is not yet to be considered in anthropology, a knowledge of

62

Subjective Mind

concrete mind (since this enters into that process of development), and to make
use of this knowledge for distinguishing the different stages of that process.

§397
(2) The moment of real opposition of the individual to itself, so that it seeks and
finds itselfin another individual. This is the sexual relationship, a natural distinc­
tion between, on the one hand, subjectivity remaining harmonious with itself in
the sentiment of ethical life, love, etc. and not advancing to the other extreme, of
universal purposes, political, scientific, or artistic; and on the other hand, the activ­
ity tensing itself for the opposition of universal, objective interests to the existing
condition both of itself and of the external world, and actualizing universal prin­
ciples in the existing conditions to form a unity that is now produced for the first
time. The sexual relationship acquires its spiritual and ethical significance and
determination in thefamily. 1

§398
(3) When individuality distinguishes, by immediate judgement, its beingfor itself
from its mere being, this is the awakening of the soul, which initially confronts its
self-absorbed natural life as one natural determinacy and state confronts anoth­
er state, sleep. 1 - lt is not merely for us or externally that waking is distinguished
from sleep; waking is itself the judgement of the individual soul, whose being-for­
self is for the soul itself the relation of this determination of it, its being-for-self,
to its mere being, its distinguishing of itself from its still undifferentiated univer­
sality. The waking state includes generally all self-conscious and rational activity
of the mind's distinguishing, a distinguishing that is for itself.2-Sleep is an
invigoration of this activity, not as a merely negative rest from it, but as a return
from the world of determinacies, from dispersion and solidification in individual
details, into the universal essence of subjectivity, which is the substance of those
determinacies and the absolute power over them.3
[Remark] The distinction between sleep and waking is one of those teasers, as
they may be called, which are often addressed to philosophy. Even Napoleon,
on a visit to the University of Pavia, put this question to the class on ideology.4
The determinacy given in the Paragraph is abstract; it primarily treats waking
as a natural state, in which the mind is of course involved implicitly, but is
not yet posited in its embodied reality. If we were to speak more concretely of
this distinction (which in its fundamental determination remains the same), the
being-for-self of the individual soul would already have to be determined as the
I of consciousness and taken as intelligent mind. The difficulty raised by the dis­
tinction of the two states only really arises, in so far as we also take into account
dreaming in sleep and then determine the representations of sober waking con­
sciousness only as representations, which is what dreams are too. In this superficial

63

Anthropology, The Soul

determination of representations the two states of course agree, because we have

thereby overlooked the difference between them; and in the case of any proposed
differentiation ofwaking consciousness, we can always return to the trivial obser­
vation that after all this too involves only representations. -But the
of the waking soul,

concretely

conceived, is

consciousness

and

being-for-self
intellect, and the

world of intellectual consciousness is something quite different from a pictorial
composition of mere representations and images. The latter, as such, are in the
main only externally connected, in an unintelligent way, by the so-called laws of
the so-called

association ofIdeas;

though here and there of course categories may

also be at work. But in waking we essentially comport ourselves as a concrete

I,

as intellect; and in virtue of the intellect intuition stands before us as a concrete
totality of determinations in which each member, each point, occupies its place, a
place determined by, and also with, all the others. So the content gets its confirm­
ation, not by j ust subjectively representing the content and distinguishing it from
the person as something external to him, but from the concrete interconnec­
tion in which each pan of this complex stands with all the other parts. Waking
is the concrete consciousness of this reciprocal corroboration of each individual
moment of its content by all the others in the pictorial composition of intuition.
This consciousness here need not be clearly developed, but this comprehensive
determinacy is involved and present in concrete self-feeling. S - In order to recog­
nize the difference between dreaming and waking we need only keep in view the
Kantian distinction between

objectivity

of representation (its determination by

categories) and subjectivity of representation; but we must also realize, as we noted

j ust now, that what is actually present in the mind need not be therefore posited
in its consciousness in an explicit way, any more than, say, the ascent of the feel­
ing mind to God need stand before consciousness in the form of proofs of God's
reality, although, as we explained earlier, these proofs do no more than express
the kernel and content of that feeling.6

Zusatz. Through waking,

the natural soul of the human individual enters into a

relationship to its substance which must be regarded as the truth, as the unity, of
the two relations established between the individuality of man and his substantial
universality or genus, one of them in the development that produces the course of
the

ages oflife,

and the other in the

sexual relationship.

For whereas in the course

of life the soul appears as the single persisting subject, the differences emerging in
it being only alterations, hence only

transient, not lasting differences, and where­

as in the sexual relationship by contrast the individual reaches a fixed difference,

real opposition to itself, and the relation of the individual to the genus active in it
develops into a relation to an individual of the opposite sex, -whereas therefore
in the first

case

simple unity predominates,

and in the second fixed opposition, in

the waking soul we see a relation of the soul to itself that is not merely simple,

but mediated by opposition; but in this being-for-self of the soul the difference
is seen to be neither so transient as in the course of the ages of life nor so fixed

64

Subjective Mind

as in the sexual relationship, but the self-producing enduring alternation of the
states of sleep and waking in one and the same individual. The necessity of the
dialectical progression from the sexual relationship to the waking of the soul lies,
however, more exactly in the fact that since each of the individuals standing in a
sexual relation to each other finds, in virtue of their implicit unity, itself again in
the other, the soul emerges from its being-in-itself to being-for-itself, that is, pre­
cisely from its sleep to waking. What in the sexual relationship is divided between
two individuals, namely, a subjectivity remaining in immediate unity with its
substance and a subjectivity entering into opposition to this substance, is, in the
waking soul, unified, and so has lost the fixity of its opposition and acquired that
fluidity of the difference by which it becomes mere states. 7 Sleep is the state of
the soul's immersion in its undifferentiated unity, waking by contrast is the state
of the soul's having entered into opposition to this simple unity. Here the nat­
ural life of mind still has its subsistence; for although the first immediacy of the
soul is already sublated and is now reduced to a mere state, yet the soul's being­
for-self resulting from the negation of that immediacy likewise still appears in
the shape of a mere state. The being-for-self, the soul's subjectivity, is not yet
combined with its implicit substantiality; the two determinations still appear as
mutually exclusive, alternating states. Of course, genuinely mental activity-will
and intelligence- is comprised in the waking state. Here however we have not
yet to consider waking in this concrete meaning but only as a state, consequently,
as something essentially distinct from will and intelligence. But that the mind
which, in its truth, is to be grasped as pure activity has in itself the states of sleep
and waking stems from the fact that mind is also soul and, as soul, descends to
the form of a natural, an immediate, a passive entity. In this shape, mind only suf
fers its becoming-for-itself. We can say, therefore, that awaking is brought about
by the fact that the lightning of subjectivity pierces through the form of mind's
immediacy. The free mind can indeed also determine itself to awaking; but here
in anthropology we consider awaking only in so far as it is a happening and in
fact this still entirely indeterminate happening: the mind simply finds itselfand
a world in general confronting it, -a self-finding that initially only gets as far as
sensation, and still remains far removed from the concrete determination of intel­
ligence and will. It is just in this fact, that the soul on awaking merelyfinds itself
and the world-this duality, this opposition- , that the naturalness of mind
here consists. s
Now the distinguishing carried out by the soul, on awaking, between itself and
the world is, owing to the soul's naturalness, connected with a physical distinc­
tion, namely with the alternation of day and night. It is natural for man to wake
by day and sleep by night; for as sleep is the state of the soul's undifferentiated­
ness, so night obscures the difference between things; and as awaking displays the
soul's distinguishing-itself-from-itself, so the light of day lets the differences of
things emerge.9

But not only in physical nature but also in the human organism a distinc­
tion is to be found which corresponds to the distinction between the sleeping
and the waking of the soul. In the animal organism it is essential to distinguish
the side of its remaining-within-itself from the side of its other-directedness.
Bichat has called the former side organic life, the latter animal life. As organic
life he counts the reproductive system: digestion, blood-circulation, perspira­
tion, breathing. This life continues in sleep; it ends only with death. Animal
life by contrast, which according to Bichat comprises the system of sensibility
and of irritability, nervous and muscular activity, - this theoretical and practical
outward-directedness ceases in sleep, which is why even the ancients ponrayed
sleep and death as brothers. The only way in which the animal organism in sleep
is still related to the external world is breathing, this wholly abstract relationship
to the undifferentiated element of air. With panicularized externality by contrast
the healthy human organism in sleep no longer stands in any relation. If, there­
fore, a man in sleep becomes active outwardly, then he is ill. This occurs with
sleep-walkers. They move about with the utmost confidence; some have written
letters and sealed them. Yet in sleep-walking the sense of sight is paralysed, the eye
in a cataleptic state.
In what Bichat calls animal life, then, an alternation of rest and activity pre­
vails, hence, as in waking, an opposition, while the organic life that does not par­
ticipate in that alternation corresponds to the undifferentiatedness of the soul
present in sleep.IO
But besides this difference in the organism's activity, we must also note a dif­
ference in the structure of the organs of the internal and the outward-directed life,
a difference corresponding to the difference between sleeping and waking. The
outer organs, the eyes, the ears, as well as the extremities, the hands and feet, are
symmetrically doubled, and we may remark in passing that this symmetty renders
them capable of becoming a theme of an. The internal organs, by contrast, dis­
play either no doubling at all or only an unsymmetrical doubling. We have only
one stomach. The lung, it is true, has two lobes, as the heart has two ventricles;
but both hean and lungs already involve the relation of the organism to an oppos­
ite, to the external world. Besides, neither the lobes of the lung nor the cardiac
ventricles are as symmetrical as the outer organs. 1 1
As regards the mental difference of waking from sleeping we may also add
the following remarks to what has been said about it in the above Paragraph.
We have defined sleep as the state in which the soul distinguishes itself neither
within itself nor from the external world. This definition, which is necessary in
and for itself, is confirmed by experience. For when our soul goes on sensing
or representing only one and the same thing, it becomes sleepy. Thus the uni­
form motion of rocking, monotonous singing, the murmuring of a brook, can
induce somnolence in us . The same effect is produced by drivel, by disconnec­
ted pointless stories. Our mind only feels fully awake when it is presented with

66

Subjective Mind

something interesting, something both new and meaningful, something intel­
ligently differentiated and coherent within itself; for in such an object it finds
itself again. The vitality of wakefulness requires, therefore, the opposition and
the unity of mind with the object. If, on the contrary, the mind does not find
again in the Other the internally differentiated totality which it is itself, then it
withdraws from this objectivity into its undifferentiated unity with itself, gets
bored, and falls asleep. But it is already implied in the foregoing remark that it
is not mind in general, but more specifically intellectual and rational thinking
that must be stimulated by the object, if wakefulness is to be present in all the
sharpness of its distinctness from sleep and from dreaming. In waking, if we take
the word in its abstract sense, we can be very bored; and, conversely, it is pos­
sible for us to have a lively interest in something in a dream. But in a dream it is
only our representational thinking, not our intellectual thinking, whose interest
is aroused. 12
But if the indeterminate idea of being interested in objects is insufficient for
distinguishing waking from dreaming, neither can the determination of clarity
appear any more adequate for this distinction. For firstly this determination is
only a quantitative one; it expresses only the immediacy of intuition and con­
sequently not the genuine core. We only have that before us when we convince
ourselves that what is intuited is a rational totality within itself. And secondly, we
know quite well that dreaming is not even invariably distinguished from waking
by inferior clarity, but on the contrary is often clearer than waking, especially in
diseases and in visionaries. 1 3
Finally, n o satisfactory distinction would b e given by the entirely indeterm­
inate claim that it is only in waking that man thinks. For thinking in general
is so much inherent in the nature of man that he always thinks, even in sleep.
In all forms of mind, in feeling, in intuition, as well as representation, think­
ing remains the foundation. In so far, therefore, as thinking is this indeterminate
foundation, it is unaffected by the alternation of sleep and waking; it does not
constitute exclusively one side of the alteration here, but is the wholly univer­
sal activity that stands above both sides of this alternation. 1 4 On the other hand,
the position is different as regards thinking in so far as thinking contrasts with
other forms of the mind as a distinct form of mental activity. In this sense, think­
ing ceases in sleep and dreaming. Intellect and reason, the modes of thinking
proper, are active only in waking. Only in the intellect does the abstract determ­
ination, pertaining to the awaking soul, of self-distinguishing from the natural,
from its undifferentiated substance and from the external world, have its intens­
ive, concrete meaning; since intellect is the infinite being-within-self which has
developed into totality, and has in just this way freed itself from the individu­
ality of the external world. But when the I is free within itself, it also makes
the objects independent of its subjectivity, considers them likewise as totalities
and as members of a totality embracing them all. Now in what is external, the
totality takes the form not of free Idea, bur of an interconnection of necessity.

Anthropology, The Soul

67

It is this objective interconnection that essentially distinguishes the representa­
tions we have in waking from those that occur in dreams. If, therefore, in waking
I encounter something whose connection with the general state of the external
world I am not yet able to discover, then I can ask: Am I awake or dreaming?
In dreams our attitude is only representational; there our representations are
not governed by the categories of the intellect. But mere representation wrests
things completely out of their concrete interconnection, individualizes them.
Hence in dreams everything drifts apan, criss-crosses in wild disorder, objects
lose all necessary, objective, intellectual, rational interconnection and only enter
into an entirely superficial, contingent and subjective combination. Thus it hap­
pens that we bring something we hear in sleep into an entirely different context
from what it has in actuality. One hears, for example, a door slam, believes a
shot has been fired, and now pictures a story of robbers. Or while asleep, one
senses a pressure on one's chest and explains it to oneself by the incubus. The
occurrence of such false representations in sleep is possible because in this state
the mind is not the totality for itself, with which, in waking, it compares all
its sensations, intuitions, and representations, in order to ascenain, from the
agreement or non-agreement of the individual sensations, intuitions, and rep­
resentations with its totality, a totality that is for itself, the objectivity or non­
objectivity of that content. It is true that when awake a man can give himself
up to the nonsense of quite empty, subjective representations; but if he has not
taken leave of his senses, he knows at the same time that these representations
are only representations because they stand in contradiction with his present
totality. 1 5
Only occasionally does something occur in a dream that has a significant con­
nection with actuality. This is especially so with dreams before midnight; in
these the representations can still to some extent be held in an orderly connec­
tion with the actuality with which we have occupied ourselves in the daytime. At
midnight, as thieves very well know, we sleep soundest; the soul has then with­
drawn into itself away from all tension with the external world. After midnight,
dreams become even more arbitrary then before. Occasionally, however, we feel
in dreams a presentiment of something which in the distraction of waking con­
sciousness we do not notice. Thus sluggish blood can evoke in a man the definite
feeling of an illness of which, in waking, he has not yet had an inkling. Similarly
in a dream the smell of something smouldering can in sleep provoke dreams of
conflagrations which do not break out until several days later and whose signs we
have not noticed in waking. I 6
Finally we must add that waking, as a natural state, as a natural tension between
the individual soul and the external world, has a limit, a measure, that therefore
the activity of the waking mind gets tired and so induces sleep which, on its side,
likewise has a limit and must progress to its opposite. This double transition is
the way in which, in this sphere, the unity of the soul's substantiality, which is in
itself, with its individuality, which is for itself, makes its appearance.

68

Subjective Mind

(y) Sensation
§399
Sleep and waking are initially, in fact, not mere alterations, bur alternating states
(a progression to infinity) . This is their formal, negative relationship; bur in it
the affirmative relationship is also present. Being is contained as an ideal moment
in the being-for-self of the waking soul; the determinacies of the content of its
sleeping nature, where they are implicitly as in their substance, are thus found by
the waking soul within its own selfand, indeed, for itself. This panicular material,
since it is determinacy, is distinct from the self-identity of being-for-self, and at
the same time simply contained in its simplicity: sensation. 1
Zusatz. As regards the dialectical progress from the awaking soul to sensation we
have to make the following remarks. The sleep that follows waking is the natur­
al mode of the soul's return from difference to distinctionless unity with itself.
In so far as mind remains entangled in the bonds of naturalness, this return
exhibits nothing but the empty repetition of the beginning-a boring cycle. But
in itself, or according to the concept, this return at the same time involves an
advance. For the transition of sleep into waking and of waking into sleep, has for
us a result which is no less positive than negative: both the undifferentiated sub­
stantial being of the soul present in sleep and the still quite abstract, still quite
empty being-for-self of the soul achieved in awaking prove to be, in their sep­
arateness, one-sided, untrue determinations and let their concrete unity emerge
as their truth. In the repeated alternation of sleep and waking, these determina­
tions are always only striving towards their concrete unity without ever reaching
it; in this alternation each of the determinations always only falls from its own
one-sidedness into the one-sidedness of the opposite determination. But this
unity always only striven for in that alternation comes to actuality in the sen­
tient soul. When the soul senses, it deals with an immediate determination that
just is, a determination only found by the soul, not yet produced by it, intern­
ally or externally given and so not dependent on it. But at the same time this
determination is immersed in the soul's universality and is thereby negated in
its immediacy and so posited ideally. Consequently the sentient soul claims this
Other of itself as its own, returns to itself in it, and in the immediacy, the being,
that it senses, is together with itself. Thus the abstract being-for-self present in
awaking obtains its first fulfilment through the determinations which are impli­
citly contained in the soul's sleeping nature, in the soul's substantial being. Actu­
alized, assured, by this fulfilment, the soul proves to itself its being-for-self, its
awokenness: it not merely is for itself, it also posits itself as for itself, as subjectiv­
ity, as negativity of its immediate determinations. Thus the soul has first attained
its genuine individuality. This subjective point of the soul now no longer stands
isolated, confronting the immediacy of the soul, bur assens itself in the man­
ifold which is contained, in potentiality, in that immediacy. The sentient soul

Anthropology, The Soul

69

posits the manifold in its inwardness and thus sublates the opposition between
its being-for-self or its subjectivity, and its immediacy or its substantial being­
in-itself; not, however, in such a manner that, as in the return of awaking into
sleep, its being-for-self makes room for its opposite, that mere being-in-itself, but
so that its being-for-self preserves itself in the alteration, in the Other, develops
and proves itself, and the soul's immediacy is reduced from the form of a state
present alongside that being-for-self to a determination subsisting only in that
being-for-self, reduced, consequently, to a semblance.2 By sensation, therefore,
the soul has reached the stage where the universal constituting its nature becomes
for the soul in an immediate determinacy. Only by this becoming-for-itself is the
soul sentient. The non-animal does not sense precisely because in it the universal
remains immersed in the determinacy, does not become for itself in the determ­
inacy. Coloured water, for example, is distinct from its colouredness and from its
uncolouredness only for us. If one and the same water were at the same time uni­
versal and coloured water, then this distinguishing determinacy would be for the
water itself, which therefore, would have sensation; for something has sensation
by maintaining itself as a universal in its determinacy.3
In the above discussion of the essence of sensation it is already implied that if,
in §398, awaking could be called a judgement of the individual soul- because
this state produces a division of the soul into a soul which is for itself and a soul
which merely is, and at the same time an immediate relation of the soul's sub­
jectivity to an Other-we can assert the presence in sensation of a syllogism, and
from that derive the assurance of wakefulness achieved by means of sensation. On
awaking, we find ourselves initially in an entirely indeterminate distinguished­
ness from the external world generally. Only when we start to sense does this
distinction become a determinate distinction. In order, therefore, to attain to full
wakefulness and certainty of it, we open our eyes, take hold of ourselves, in a
word, examine whether some determinate Other, something determinately dis­
tinct from ourselves, is for us. In this examination we no longer relate ourselves
directly to the Other, but mediately. Thus, for example, contact is the mediation
between myself and the Other, since though it is different from these two sides of
the opposition, yet at the same time it unites them both. So here, as in sensation
generally, the soul by the mediation of something standing between itself and the
Other, joins together with itself in the sensed content, reflects itself out of the
Other into itself, separates itself from the Other and thereby confirms to itself its
being-for-self. This joining of the soul together with itself is the advance that the
soul, after dividing itself in awaking, makes by its transition to sensation. 4

§400
Sensation is the form in which the mind weaves its sombre web in its unconscious
and unintellectual individuality, where every determinacy is still immediate, pos­
ited in an undeveloped way both in its content and as an objective counterpart to

70

Subjective Mind

the subject, belonging as it does to the subject's own mostparticular, natural pecu­
liarity. The content of sensation is, by this very fact, restricted and transient, since
it belongs to natural, immediate being, thus to what is qualitative and finite. 1
[Remark] Everything is in semation, and, if you like, everything that emerges
in the conscious mind and in reason has its source and origin in sensation; for
source and origin just mean the first, most immediate manner in which some­
thing appears. It is not enough, they say, to have principles, religion, etc. only
in the head: they must also be in the heart, in sentiment. In fact, what we thus
have in the head is in consciousness in general and the content is an object of con­
sciousness. So that although the content is posited in me, in the abstract I, it can
equally be kept at a distance from me, from my concrete subjectivity. In senti­
ment, by contrast, such a content is determinacy of my entire being-for-self, dull
as it is in such a form; it is thus posited as something of my very own. What is
my own is something unseparated from the actual concrete I, and this immediate
unity of the soul with its substance and with the determinate content of the sub­
stance is just this unseparatedness, in so far as it is not determined as far as the I of
consciousness, still less to the freedom of the mind's rationality. It is, by the way,
a commonly held view that will, conscience, and character possess an entirely dif­
ferent intensity and steadfastness of being-my-own, than sentiment in general and
the aggregate of sentiment, heart. Of course it is correct to say that above all the
heart must be good. But sentiment and heart is not the form by which anything is
justified as religious, ethical, true, just, etc., and an appeal to heart and sentiment
either means nothing or means something bad. We should hardly need to be
reminded of this. There can be nothing more commonplace than the experience
that at least there are also bad, evil, godless, mean, etc. sentiments and hearts.
In fact, that the heart is the source only of this type of content is expressed in
the words: 'For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, for­
nications, false witness, blasphemies, etc.' In times when scientific theology and
philosophy make heart and sentiment the criterion of what is good, ethical, and
religious, it becomes necessary to recall this commonplace experience; just as it is
nowadays necessary to remind ourselves that thinking is what is our very own, is
what distinguishes man from animals, and that man has sensibility in common
with them. 2

Zusatz. Although the peculiarly human content belonging to free mind also
assumes the form of sensibility, yet this form as such is a form common to the
animal soul and the human soul and not, therefore, appropriate to that content.
The contradiction between mental content and sentiment consists in the fact that
the content is a universal in and for itself, necessary, genuinely objective, whereas
sentiment is individualized, contingent, one-sidedly subjective. We propose to
explain briefly here to what extent the above-mentioned determinations must
be predicated of sentiment. As we have already remarked, what is sensed has
essentially the form of immediacy, of a mere being, no matter whether it stems

Anthropology, The Soul

71

from the free mind or from the sensory world. The idealization that the things of
external nature undergo in being sensed is a still entirely superficial idealization,
far removed from the complete sublation of the immediacy of this content.
But the mental material, in itself opposed to this content that just is, becomes
in the sentient soul an existent in the mode of immediacy. Now since what
is unmediated is an individualized item, everything sensed has the form of
individualization. This is readily admitted of sensations of the external, but it
must also be assened of the sensations of the internal. When the spiritual, the
rational, the lawful, ethical, and religious assume the form of sentiment, it gets
the shape of a sensory item, of something disconnected, lying asunder, and thus
acquires a similarity to what is externally sensed, which, though of course sensed
only in individualities, e.g. in individual colours, yet, like the spiritual, in itself
involves a universal, e.g. colour in general. The more comprehensive, higher
nature of the spiritual does not therefore emerge in sentiment, only in conceptual
thinking. But in the individualization of the sensed content, its contingency and
its one-sided subjective form are also grounded. The subjectivity of sentiment
must not be sought in an indeterminate way in the fact that by sentiment
man posits something within himself-for in thinking, too, he posits something
within himself-but more determinately in the fact that he posits something in
his natural, immediate, individual subjectivity, not in his free, spiritual, universal
subjectivity. This natural subjectivity is not yet a self-determining subjectivity
following its own law and acting in a necessary manner, but a subjectivity
determined from outside, tied to this space and to this time, dependent on
contingent circumstances. Therefore, by transposition into this subjectivity every
content becomes a contingent content and acquires determinations belonging
only to this individual subject. It is thus quite inadmissible to appeal to one's
mere sentiments. Whoever does this withdraws from the realm, common to
all , of grounds, of thinking, and of objectivity, into his individual subjectivity,
into which, since it is essentially passive, the most unintelligent and bad content
can work its way, as well as the intelligent and the good. It is evident from all
this that sentiment is the worst form for the mental and that it can spoil the
best content.3-At the same time, it is already implied in the above that the
opposition between a senser and a sensed, a subjective and an objective, still
remains foreign to mere sensation. The subjectivity of the sentient soul is such
an immediate subjectivity, so undeveloped, so little self-determining and self­
differentiating, that the soul, in so far as it only senses, does not yet apprehend
itself as a subjective confronting an objective. This distinction belongs only to
consciousness, only emerges when the soul has attained to the abstract thought of
its I, of its infinite being-for-self. Of this distinction therefore we have first to
speak in the Phenomenology. Here in Anthropology we have only to consider the
distinction given by the content of sensation. This we shall do in the following
Paragraph. 4

72

Subjective Mind

§401
What the sentient soul finds within itself is, on the one hand, the natural and
immediate, as within the soul ideally and made its own. On the other hand, and
conversely, what originally belongs to being-for-self (i.e. to what is, when fur­
ther deepened and absorbed in itself, free mind and the I of consciousness) is
determined to natural bodiliness, and is thus sensed. 1 In this way two distinct
spheres of sensation emerge. One type of sensation is at first a determination
of bodiliness (e.g. of the eye or of any physical part whatever), which becomes
sensation by being driven inward, recollected in the soul's being-for-self. The oth­
er is the sphere of determinacies originating in the mind and belonging to it,
which, in order to be sensed, in order to be as if found, become embodied. Thus
the determinacy is posited in the subject, namely in the soul. The subdivision
into species of the first type of sensation is seen in the system of the senses. The
other, inwardly originated, determinacies of sensation necessarily also form a sys­
tem; and their embodiment, as posited in the living, concretely developed natural
structure, takes place in a particular system or organ of the body, corresponding
to the particular content of the mental determination.2
[Remark] Sensation in general is the healthy participation of the individual mind
in its bodiliness. The senses form the simple system of specific corporeal func­
tions: ( 1 ) Physical ideality divides into two, because in such immediate and not
yet subjective idealiry, distinction appears as diversity: the senses of determinate
light (cf. §§3 1 7 ff.) and of sound (cf. §300) . (2) Diffusive reality is for its own part
immediately a double reality: the senses of smell and taste (§§32 1 , 322). (3) the
sense of solid reality, of heavy matter, of heat (§303), of shape (§3 1 0) . Around
the centre of the sentient individuality these specifications arrange themselves
more simply than in the development of natural corporeality.3
The system of internal sensation in the particularization of its self-embodiment
would deserve to be treated in detail in a specific science of its own, a psychic­
al physiology. Something of a relation of this type is already contained in the
sensation of the appropriateness or inappropriateness of an immediate sensa­
tion to the sensory interior with a determination of its own-the pleasant or
unpleasant; as also in the determinate comparison in the use of sensations, e.g.
of colours, sounds, smells, as symbols. But the most interesting aspect of a psych­
ical physiology would be to study not mere sympathy, but more specifically the
embodiment assumed by mental determinations, especially as emotions. We should
have to comprehend the connection by which anger and courage are felt in the
breast, in the blood, in the irritable system, just as contemplation and mental pre­
occupation are sensed or felt in the head, the centre of the sensitive system. We
should require a more thorough understanding than hitherto of the most famil­
iar connections by which tears, and voice in general, namely speech, laughter,
sighs, with many other particularizations lying in the direction of pathognomy

Anthropology, The Soul

73

and physiognomy, are formed from out of the soul. In physiology the viscera and
the organs are regarded as moments only of the animal organism; but they form
at the same time a system of embodiment of the mental, and in this way get an
entirely different interpretation. 4
Zusatz. The content of sensation is either a content stemming from the external
world or one belonging to the interior of the soul; a sensation is thus either an
external or an internal sensation. Here we have to consider the second type of
sensations only in so far as they become embodied; on the side of their inwardness
they belong to the sphere of psychology. The external sensations, by contrast, are
an object of Anthropology exclusively.s
The first thing to be said about the last-named type of sensations is that we
obtain them through the various senses. The senser is here determined from out­
side, i.e., his bodiliness is determined by something external. The various modes
of this determination constitute the various external sensations. Each of these
various modes is a universal possibility of being determined, a circle of individual
sensations. Seeing, for example, contains the indeterminate possibility of a mul­
tiplicity of visual sensations. The universal nature of the ensouled individual is
also displayed in the fact that in the determinate modes of sensing the individual
is not tied to some single item but embraces a circle of individualities. If, on the
contrary, I could see only what was blue, this limitation would be a quality of
mine. But since, in contrast to natural things, I am the universal that is togeth­
er with itself in the determinacy, I see the coloured in general, or rather all the
varieties of the coloured. 6
The general modes of sensing are related to the various physical and chem­
ical determinacies of the natural, the necessity of which is to be demonstrated
in philosophy of nature, and these modes are mediated by the various sense­
organs. The fact that in general sensation of the external divides up into such
diverse, mutually indifferent modes of sensing, lies in the nature of its content,
since this is a sensory content, and the sensory is so closely synonymous with
the self-external that even internal sensations by their mutual externality become
something sensory.?
Now why we have j ust the familiar Jive senses-no more and no fewer, and
differing in the way they do - , the rational necessity of this must, in a philosoph­
ical treatment, be demonstrated. This happens when we conceive the senses as
presentations of the concept's moments. These moments are, as we know, only
three. But the quintet of senses reduces quite naturally to three classes of senses.
The first is formed by the senses of physical ideality, the second by those of real
difference; in the third class falls the sense of earthly totality. 8
As presentations of the concept's moments, each of these three classes must
form a totality within itself. But now the first class contains the sense of the
abstractly universal, of the abstractly ideal, and therefore of what is not genuinely
total. Here, therefore, the totality cannot be present as a concrete totality, only

74

Subjective Mind

as a sundered totality, a totality divided within itself, distributed to two abstract
moments. Hence the first class embraces two senses-seeing and hearing. For
seeing, the ideal takes the form of simply relating to itself, for hearing it takes the
form of producing itselfby the negation of the material. -The second class, being
the class of difference, exhibits the sphere of process, of the decomposition and
dissolution of concrete corporeality. Bur from the determination of difference,
a doubling of the senses of this class at once follows. The second class contains,
therefore, the senses ofsmell and taste. The first is the sense of the abstract process,
the second the sense of the concrete process. Lastly the third class includes only
one sense, fieling, because feeling is the sense of the concrete totality.9
Let us now consider more closely the individual senses.
Sight is the sense of the physical ideal that we call light. We can say of light
that it is, as it were, space become physical. For light, like space, is indivisible,
a limpid ideality, absolutely determinationless extension, without any reflection­
into-self, and consequently without inwardness. Light manifests its Other and
this manifesting constitutes its essence; bur within itself it is abstract self-identity,
the opposite of nature's asunderness emerging within nature itself, and there­
fore immaterial matter. Hence light offers no resistance, has no limitation within
itself, expands on all sides into the immeasureable distance, is absolutely weight­
less, imponderable. Sight has to do only with this ideal element and with its
obscuration by the dark, i.e. with colour. Colour is what is seen, light is the medi­
um of seeing. The strictly material aspect of corporeality, by contrast, does not
yet concern us in seeing. Therefore the objects we see can be far from us. In see­
ing we have, as it were, a merely theoretical, not yet a practical, relationship to
things; for in seeing we let things subsist calmly as beings and relate ourselves only
to their ideal side. Owing to this independence of sight of corporeality proper, it
can be called the noblest sense. On the other hand, sight is a very imperfect sense
because by it a body does not come to us immediately as a spatial totality, as body,
always only as surface, only according to the two dimensions ofwidth and height,
and we only get to see a body successively in all its dimensions, in its total shape
by adopting various points of view towards it. The most distant objects origin­
ally appear to sight, as we can observe in children, on one and the same surface
as those nearest to us, just because sight does not immediately see depth. Only
when we notice that to the depth perceived by feeling there corresponds some­
thing dark, a shadow, do we come to believe that where a shadow becomes visible
to us we see a depth. Connected with this is the fact that we do not immediately
perceive by sight the measure of the distance of bodies but can only infer it from
the smaller or greater appearance of objects. 10
In contrast to sight, which is the sense of ideality devoid of inwardness, hear­
ing is the sense of the pure inwardness of the corporeal. Just as sight is related
to space become physical, to light, so hearing is related to time become physical,
to sound. For sound is the temporal positedness of corporeality, the movement,
the vibration of a body within itself, a trembling, a mechanical tremor in which

Anthropology, The Soul

75

the body, without having to alter its relative place as a whole body, moves only
its pans, posits its inner spatiality temporally, thus sublates its indifferent asun­
derness and by this sublation lets its pure inwardness emerge, but immediately
restores itself from the superficial alteration it has undergone from the mechan­
ical tremor. But the medium through which sound reaches our hearing is not
merely the element of air but in still greater measure the concrete corporeality
located between us and the sounding object, for example the earth: when held
to the earth the ear has occasionally heard cannonades which could not be heard
through the mere mediation of air. 1 1
The senses of the second class enter into relation with real corporeality. But they
do not yet have to do with it in so far as it is for itself, offers resistance, but only
in so far as it is in the course of dissolution, enters into its process. This process is
something necessary. Bodies are, of course, destroyed panly by external, contin­
gent causes; but apart from this contingent downfall bodies perish by their own
nature, consume themselves, but in such a manner that their ruin has the semb­
lance of coming to them from outside. Thus it is the air whose action gives rise to
the process of the silent, imperceptible dissipation of all bodies, the evaporation
of vegetable and animal formations. Now although both smell and taste stand in
relation to self-dissolving corporeality, yet these two senses are distinguished from
each other by the fact that smell receives a body in the abstract, simple, indeterm­
inate process of dissipation or evaporation; whereas taste is related to the real,
concrete process of the body and to the chemical determinacies emerging in this
process: the sweet, the bitter, the alkaline, the acidic, and the salty. With taste, a
direct contact with the object is necessary, whereas even the sense of smell does
not yet need such contact. In hearing, such contact is even less necessary and in
seeing it does not occur at all. I2
As already remarked, the third class contains only the one sense offeeling. In
so far as this resides primarily in the fingers it is also called the sense of touch.
Feeling is the most concrete of all the senses. For its distinctive essentiality con­
sists in its relation, not to the physical as abstractly universal or ideal, nor to the
determinacies of the corporeal as they separate out from it, but to the solid reality
of the corporeal. Only for feeling, therefore, is there strictly an Other subsisting
for itself, an individual entity for itself, confronting the senser as a similarly indi­
vidual entity for itself. Hence feeling includes the impression of heaviness, i.e. of
the unity sought by bodies as they persist for themselves-and do not enter into
the process of dissolution but offer resistance. In general, it is material being-for­
self that is for feeling. But to the various modes of this being-for-self belong not
only weight but also the type of cohesion: the hard, the soft, the rigid, the brittle,
the rough, the smooth. However, along with persisting, firm corporeality, the
negativity of the material as subsisting for itself-namely, heat-is also for feel­
ing. By heat, the specific gravity and the cohesion of bodies are altered. Hence,
this alteration affects that by which the body is essentially a body. To that extent
we can therefore say that even in the impression of heat, solid corporeality is for

76

feeling. Finally, shape in its three dimensions falls in the province of feeling; for
the mechanical determinacy in general pertains entirely to feeling. 13
Besides the indicated qualitative differences, the senses have also a quantitative
determination of sensation, its strength or weakness. Here quantity necessarily
appears as intensive magnitude because the sensation is a simple entity. Thus,
for example, the sensation of pressure exerted by a determinate mass on the
sense of feeling is something intensive, although this intensity also exists extens­
ively, measured in pounds, etc. But the quantitative side of sensation affords no
interest for philosophical treatment in so far as this quantitative determination
becomes also qualitative and thereby forms a measure, beyond which the sen­
sation becomes too strong and therefore painful, and below which it becomes
imperceptible. 14
On the other hand, the relation of outer sensations to the interior of the sen­
tient subject becomes important for philosophical anthropology. This interior is
not something entirely indeterminate, undifferentiated. The very fact that the
magnitude of the sensation is an intensive magnitude and must have a certain
measure, involves a relation of the impression to the subject's determinedness­
in-and-for-itself, a certain determinacy of the subject's sensicivity, -a reaction
of subjectivity to externality, and so the germ or beginning of inner sensation.
Already by this internal determinacy of the subject, man's outer sensing is distin­
guished more or less from that of animals. Some animals can, in certain circum­
stances, have sensations of something external that is not yet present for human
sensation. Camels, for example, can even scent springs and streams miles away. 1 5
But it is more b y its relation to the mental interior than by this peculiar meas­
ure of sensitivity that outer sensation becomes something peculiarly anthropo­
logical. Now this relation has manifold aspects, though not all of them pertain
to our consideration here yet. In particular, the determination of a sensation as
a pleasant or unpleasant one remains excluded from consideration here-this
comparison, more or less interwoven with reflection, of outer sensation with our
nature determined in and for itself, whose satisfaction or non-satisfaction by an
impression makes the impression in the first case a pleasant, in the second case
an unpleasant, sensation. Just as little can the arousal of urges by impressions be
drawn into the field of our inquiry. This arousal belongs to the realm of practical
mind which still lies far ahead. "What we have to consider at this stage is simply
and solely the unconscious relatedness of outer sensation to the mental interior.
Through this relation there arises in us what we call mood, -an appearance of
the mind of which, admittedly, we find an analogue in animals (just as we find
an analogue of the sensation of the pleasant or unpleasant and of the arousal of
urges by impressions), but which (like the above-named other mental appear­
ances) at the same time has a peculiarly human character and which moreover
becomes something anthropological, in the narrower sense we have indicated,
by being something not yet known with full consciousness by the subject. Even
when we were considering the natural soul not yet advanced to individuality,

Anthropology, The Soul

77

we had to talk about its moods, which correspond to an external factor. At that
stage, this external factor was still entirely universal circumstances, of which one
really cannot say, precisely owing to their indeterminate universality, that they
are sensed. By contrast, at the standpoint to which we have so far brought the
development of the soul, external sensation itself is what arouses the mood. But
this effect is produced by outer sensation in so far as an inner meaning is imme­
diately, i.e. without conscious intelligence needing to intervene, associated with
it. By this meaning, the external sensation becomes something symbolic. We must
note, however, that what we have here is not yet a symbol in the proper mean­
ing of the word; for strictly speaking a symbol requires an external object distinct
from us in which we become conscious of an internal determinacy, or which we
generally relate to such a determinacy. But in a mood aroused by an external sen­
sation we are not yet in relationship to an external object distinct from us, we are
not yet consciousness. Consequently, as we have said, the symbolic does not yet
appear here in its proper shape. 1 6
Now the mental sympathies aroused by the symbolic nature of impressions
are something entirely familiar. We get that sort of thing from colours, sounds,
smells, tastes, and also from what is for the sense of feeling. -As regards col­
ours, there are grave, gay, fiery, cold, sad, and soothing colours. Definite colours
are therefore chosen as signs of our present mood. Thus for the expression of
grief, of inner gloom, of the nightfall of the mind, we take the colour of night, of
the darkness not brightened by light, colourless black. Solemnity and dignity are
also denoted by black, because in it the play of contingency, of manifoldness and
mutability finds no place. Pure, luminous, serene white, on the other hand, cor­
responds to the simplicity and serenity of innocence. The proper colours have, so
to speak, a more concrete meaning than black and white. Thus purple has ranked
from time immemorial as the royal colour; for this is the most powerful colour,
the most striking to the eye, -the interpenetration of bright and dark in the full
strength of their unity and their opposition. Blue, by contrast, as the simple unity
of bright and dark inclining towards the passive dark, is the symbol of gentle­
ness, of femininity, oflove and fidelity, and that is why painters, too, have almost
always painted the queen of heaven in a blue garment. Yellow is not merely the
symbol of ordinary gaiety but also of jaundiced envy. Of course, the choice of
colour for clothing can be very much a matter of convention; though at the same
time, as we have observed, a rational sense reveals itself in that choice. There is
also something symbolic in the lustre and dullness of colour; lustre corresponds
to the usually cheerful mood of people in dazzling situations, -dullness of col­
our, on the other hand, to the splendour-scorning simplicity and tranquillity of
character. In white itself there is a difference of lustre and dullness depending on
whether it appears, for example, on linen, on cotton, or on silk; and one finds in
many peoples a definite feeling for the symbolism of this distinction. 17
Besides colours, it is particularly sounds which produce in us a corresponding
mood. This is especially true of the human voice; for this is the principal way in

Subjective Mind

78

which a human being discloses his interior; what he is, he puts into his voice.
In the melodious-sounding voice, therefore, we believe we can safely recognize
the beauty of soul of the speaker, and in the harshness of his voice, a coarse
feeling. In the first

case,

the sound evokes our sympathy, in the latter case our

antipathy. Blind people are particularly attentive to the symbolism of the human
voice. It is even affirmed that they claim to detect someone's physical beauty in
the melodious sound of the voice,-that they even think they hear pockmarks in
faint speaking through the nose.
So much for the relation of

external

sensations to the mental interior. We

have already seen in considering this relation that the interior of the senser is
not a complete void, not entirely indeterminate, but on the contrary that it is
determined in and for itself. This is true even of the animal soul, but it is true in
incomparably higher measure of the human interior. The human interior there­
fore contains a content that is for itself an

internal,

not an external content. But

for this content to be sensed two things are necessary, first an external occasion
and secondly an

embodiment of the internal content,

thus a transformation or a

relation of it that constitutes the opposite of the relation into which the content
given by the external senses is placed by its symbolic nature. Just as

outer sensa­
inner

tions make themselves into symbols, i.e. are related to the mental interior, so
sensations necessarily

externalize, embody, themselves because they belong to the

natural soul, consequently are simply in being, and so must acquire an imme­
diate reality in which the soul becomes for itself. When we speak of the inner
determination of the sentient subject, without reference to the embodiment of
this determination, we consider this subject in

us, but not yet

the way

in which it is only for

how it is for itself together with itself in its determination, how

it senses itself in it. Only by the embodiment of inner determinations does the

subject get to the stage of sensing them; for before they can be sensed it is neces­

sary that they be posited both as distinct from the subject and as identical with
it; but this happens only by the externalization, by the embodiment of the inner
determinations of the senser. The embodying of these manifold inner determina­
tions presupposes a realm of bodiliness in which this takes place.This realm, this
restricted sphere, is my corporeal body. This thus determines itself as a sphere of
sensation, both for the inner and for the outer determinations of the soul. The
vitality of this corporeal body of mine consists in this, that its materiality is unable
to be for itself, can offer no resistance to me, but is subordinate to me, is per­
vaded through and through by my soul for which it is an ideality. Since this is the
nature of my corporeal body the embodiment of my sensations thereby becomes
possible and necessary,-the movements of my soul immediately become move­
ments of my corporeality.1B
Now inner sensations are of two kinds:
First, those which concern my immediate
particular relationship or state; here, for
shame, remorse.

individuality

situated in some

belong anger, revenge, envy,

Anthropology, The Soul

79

Secondly, those which are related to a universal in and for itself, to right, ethics,
religion, to the beautiful and true.
Both kinds of inner sensation, as we have already remarked, have this in com­
mon, that they are determinations which my immediately individual, my natural
mind finds within itself. On the one hand, the rwo kinds can come close to
each other either when the sensed content of right, ethics, and religion acquires
more and more the form of individualization, or when, conversely, sensations
that initially concern the individual subject get a stronger addition of universal
content. On the other hand, the difference berween the rwo kinds of inner sensa­
tion becomes more and more pronounced the more the feelings of right, ethics,
and religion are freed from the admixture of the subject's particularity and are
thereby raised to pure forms of the universal in and for itself. But in the same
measure that the individuality in inner sensations yields to the universal, these
sensations are spiritualized and their expression thus loses some of the bodiliness
of its appearance. I9
We have already stated above that the moreprecise content of internal sensation
cannot yet be an object of our discussion here in Anthropology. Just as we accep­
ted the content of outer sensations from the philosophy of nature now behind
us, where the rational necessity of that content had been demonstrated, so here
we must anticipate as far as it is necessary the content of inner sensations, which
finds its pmper place only in the third pan of the theory of subjective mind. Our
object for now is only the embodiment of inner sensations, and more specifically
only the embodiment occurring involuntarily, not the will-dependent embodi­
ment of my sensations by means ofgesture. This second kind of embodiment does
not yet belong here because it presupposes that mind has already become master
of its bodiliness, has consciously made it into an expression of its internal sensa­
tions-something which has here not yet taken place. At this point, as we have
said, we have only to consider the immediate transition of internal sensation into
the bodily mode of reality, an embodiment that can indeed also become visible
to others, can develop into a sign of the inner sensation, but does not necessarily
become such a sign -and does so, at any rate, without the will of the senser. 20
Now just as mind employs the members of its outward-directed life, of its
animal life (as Bichat expresses it), the face, the hands, and the feet, for the dis­
play, occurring with regard to others, of its interior by means ofgesture, so, on the
other hand, it is especially the members of the inward-turned life, the so-called
'precious viscera', that must be designated as the organs in which the inner sen­
sations of the sentient subject are embodied for himself, but not necessarily for
others, in an immediate, involuntary manner. 2 1
The main phenomena of this embodiment are already familiar to everyone
through language, which contains a good deal bearing on this topic which can­
not very well be explained away as an age-old error. In general, it may be noted
that inner sensations can be either beneficial or harmful and even ruinous, both
to soul and to the whole body. Cheerfulness preserves health, grief undermines it.

80

Subjective Mind

An impediment arising in the soul from grief and pain and bringing itself to exist­
ence in a bodily mode can, if it occurs suddenly and exceeds a certain limit, lead
to death or the loss of intellect. Equally dangerous is sudden excessive joy; like
overwhelming pain, this gives rise for representation to such a stark contradiction
between the preceding and the present circumstances of the sentient subject, to
such a rupture of the interior, that its embodiment can result in the fracture of
the organism, death, or derangement. A man of character, however, is much less
exposed than others to such effects, since his mind has made itself much freer of
his bodiliness and has acquired a much firmer composure than a natural man,
poor in representations and thoughts, who does not possess the power to endure
the negativity of a sudden invasion of violent pain. 22
But even if this embodiment does not have a stimulating or depressing effect to
a devastating degree, yet it will assail more or less immediately the whole organ­
ism, since in this all organs and all systems are in a living unity with each other.
All the same, it is not to be denied that inner sensations, in accordance with the
diversity of their content, also have a particular organ in which they are initially
and principally embodied. This connection between a determinate sensation and
its particular bodily mode of appearance cannot be refuted by individual cases
running counter to the rule. Such exceptions, chargeable to the impotence of
nature, do not justifY ascribing this connection to pure contingency and suppos­
ing perhaps that anger could equally well be felt in the belly or the head as in the
heart. Even language has sufficient understanding to employ heart for courage,
head for intelligence, and not heart, say, for intelligence. But science is bound to
show the necessary relation prevailing between a determinate inner sensation and
the physiological significance of the organ in which it is embodied. We propose
here to touch briefly on the most universal phenomena concerning this point.
It is one of the most undeniable experiences that grief, this impotent burying of
the soul within itself, embodies itself mainly as an abdominal illness, hence in
the reproductive system, consequently in that system which displays the negative
return of the animal subject to itself. Courage and anger, by contrast, this negat­
ive directedness-outwards against an alien force, against an injury which enrages
us, has its immediate seat in the breast, in the heart, the focal point of irritab­
ility, of negative expulsion. In anger the heart throbs, the blood gets hotter and
mounts to the face, and the muscles get tense. Here, particularly in annoyance,
where the anger remains internal rather than discharging itself violently, the bile
already belonging to the reproductive system can of course overflow, and indeed
to such a degree that jaundice occurs. But we must remark on this that bile is, as
it were, the fiery stuff, by emission of which the reproductive system, so to say,
vents its anger, its irritability, on food, dissolving and consuming it with the aid
of the animal water poured out by the pancreas. -Shame, which is closely akin
to anger, is likewise embodied in the blood system. Shame is an incipient, a sub­
dued anger of a man about himself; for it involves a reaction to the contradiction
between my appearance and what I ought and will to be, -thus a defence of my

Anthropology, The Soul

81

interior against my incongruous appearance. This mental outward-directedness is
embodied by the blood being driven into the face, so that one blushes and in this
way alters one's appearance. In contrast to shame, terror, this shrinking into itself
of the soul in face of a seemingly insurmountable negative, expresses itself by the
blood receding from the cheeks, by blanching, as well as by trembling. If, how­
ever, nature is perverse enough to create some people who blanch from shame
and blush from fear, science must not let such inconsistencies of nature deter
it from recognizing the opposite of these irregularities as law. - Finally,

ing,

think­

too, in so far as it is a temporal occurrence and belongs to the immediate

individuality, has a bodily appearance, is sensed, and indeed particularly in the
head, in the brain, in general in the system of sensibility, of the simple universal
being-within-itself of the sentient subject. 23
In all the embodiments of the mental j ust considered, only that externalization
of soul-motions occurs which is necessary for them to be sensed or can serve to
show the interior. But this externalization is only complete when it becomes an

elimination,

an expulsion of internal sensations. S uch an alienating embodiment

laughter, even more so in weeping, in sighing and sob­
voice, even before this is articulated, even before it becomes

of the interior is shown in
bing, in general in the

speech.24
To comprehend the connection between these physiological phenomena and
the motions of the soul corresponding to them is a matter of no little difficulty.
As regards the mental side of these phenomena, we know with regard
to

laughter

that it is generated by an immediately obvious contradiction, by

something turning at once into its opposite, hence by something immediately
self-annihilating, -assuming that we are not involved in this null content, do
not regard it as our own; for if we felt ourselves injured by the destruction of
this content, then we should

weep.

If, for example, someone proudly striding

along falls over, this can give rise to laughter over it, because he experiences

in his person the simple dialectic that what happens to him is the opposite
of what he intended. Hence what provokes laughter in genuine

comedies

also

essentially lies in the immediate veering round of a purpose in itself null into
its opposite; whereas in

tragedy it is substantial purposes which destroy themselves

in their mutual opposition. With the dialectic befalling the object of comedy,
the subjectivity of the spectator or listener attains to a serene and untroubled
enjoyment of itself, since it is the absolute ideality, the infinite power over
every limited content, consequently the pure dialectic by which, in fact, the
comic object is annihilated. Herein lies the ground of the gaiety into which we
are transported by the comic. But the

physiological

appearance of this gaiery,

which particularly interests us here, is in harmony with this ground. For in
laughter, the subjectivity attaining to untroubled enjoyment of itself, this pure
self, this spiritual light, embodies itself as a glow spreading over the countenance,
and at the same time the spiritual act by which the soul repels the ridiculous
from itself finds a bodily expression in the forcibly interrupted expulsion of

Subjective Mind

82

the breath. - Incidentally, though laughter pertains to the natural soul, hence
is anthropological, it ranges from the vulgar peals of side-splitting guffaw of
someone empty or coarse to the gentle smile of the noble soul, smiling through
tears, a series of gradations in which laughter frees itself more and more from its
naturalness until in smiling it becomes a gesture, thus something originating in
free will. The various modes of laughter indicate, therefore, the cultural level of
individuals in a very characteristic manner.

A man of reflection never, or only
Pericles, foe example, is supposed

rarely, abandons himself to peals of laughter;

not to have laughed any more after he had dedicated himself to public affairs.
Excessive laughter is rightly held to be evidence of dullness, of a foolish mentality
that is insensitive to all great, genuinely substantial interests and regards them as
external and alien to it. 25

Weeping,

as we know, is the opposite of laughter. Just as the harmony of the

subject with itself, sensed at the expense of the comic object, reaches its embod­
iment in laughter, so the internal

conflict of the

senser, produced by a negat­

ive-pain -expresses itself in weeping. Tears are the critical outburst, - so not
merely the expression but also the elimination of pain; accordingly, they have
j ust as beneficial an effect on health in the presence of significant tribulations
of the soul, as pain that does not dissolve in tears can be harmful to health and
life. 2 6 In tears, pain, the feeling of the rending opposition that has penetrated the
heart, becomes water, a neutral, indifferent stuff, and this neutral material itself
into which pain is transformed is discharged by the soul from its bodiliness. In
this discharge, as in that embodiment, lies the cause of the therapeutic effect of
weeping. - But that precisely the

eyes should be the organ from which the pain

pouring out in tears surges forth, this lies the fact that the eye has a rwofold
determination: on the one hand, it is the organ of sight, thus of the sensation
of external objects; and secondly it is the place where the soul reveals itself in the

simplest manner, since the eye's expression displays the fleeting, as it were exhaled,
portrait of the soul, - and that is why people, in order to know each other, start
by looking each other in the eye. Now the negativity which someone senses in
pain inhibits his activity, reduces him to passivity, clouds the ideality, the

light of

his soul, and more or less dissolves the soul's firm unity with itself; accordingly,
this state of soul embodies itself by a dimming of the eyes, and still more by a
moistening of them which can act so obstructively on the function of sight, on
this ideal activity of the eye, that the eye can no longer stand looking out.

A still more perfect embodiment and also expulsion of internal sensations than
voice. For in voice it is not

occurs in laughing and in crying is produced by the

that, as in laughing, something present externally is merely formed, nor that, as
in crying, a real material is extruded, but that an ideal, a, so to say, incorporeal
bodiliness, is generated, thus the sort of material in which the inwardness of the
subject thoroughly retains the character of inwardness, the soul's ideality that is
for itself receives an external reality fully corresponding to it -a reality which
is immediately sublated in its arising, since the propagation of sound is j ust as

Anthropology, The Soul

83

much its disappearance. By the voice therefore sensation obtains an embodiment
in which it dies away j ust as fast as it expresses itself. This is the ground of the
higher power present in the voice of eliminating what is sensed internally. That
is why the Romam, who were well acquainted with this power, intentionally let
women wail at funerals in order to make the pain that had emerged in them into
something alien to them. 27
Now the abstract bodiliness of the voice can of course become a sign for oth­
ers, who recognize it as such; but here, at the standpoint of the natural soul, the
voice is not yet a sign produced by the free will, not yet speech articulated by
the energy of intelligence and of will, but only a sounding immediately produced
by sensation, which, though lacking articulation, still already shows itself capable
of various modifications. Animals, in the expression of their sensations, only get
as far as the inarticulate voice, as far as the cry of pain or pleasure, and many
animals even achieve this ideal expression of their inwardness only in extreme
need. Man, however, does not stop short at this animal mode of expressing him­
self; he creates articulate speech by which internal sensations get a word in, are
expressed in their entire determinacy, become an object to the subject, and at the
same time external and alien to him. Articulate speech is thus the highest mode in
which man eliminates from himself his internal sensations. It is, therefore, with
good reason that on the occasion of someone's death funeral hymns are sung and
condolences conveyed; and even though occasionally these may seem or be bur­
densome, yet they have the advantage, that by the repeated talk about the loss
that has occurred they lift the grief over it out of its cramped lodging in the heart
into representation and so make it into an object, into something confronting the
grief-stricken subject. But poetic composition in particular has the power to lib­
erate from oppressive feelings. Goethe, for instance, more than once restored his
spiritual freedom by pouring out his pain in a poem. 28
Here, however, in Anthropology we can speak only in anticipation of the
expression and the externalization of internal sensations by articulate speech.
What remains to be mentioned in this place is the physiological aspect ofvoice.
Regarding this point, we know that the voice, this simple vibration of the animal
organism, commences in the diaphragm, but then also stands in close connec­
tion with the respiratory organs and receives its final formation from the mouth,
which has a dual function, first of initiating the immediate conversion of food
into structures of the living animal organism and on the other hand, in contrast
1
to this internalizing of the external, of completing the objectification of subjectiv­
ity occurring in the voice.

§402
Because they are immediate and just found, sensations are individual and tran­
sient determinations, alterations in the substantiality of the soul, posited in the
soul's being-for-self, which is identical to its substantiality. But this being-for-self

84

Subjective Mind

is not merely a formal moment ofsensation; the soul is implicitly a reflected total­
ity of sensation -sensation within itselfof the total substantiality which it is in
itself,-feeling soul. l
[Remark] In ordinary linguistic usage, sensation and feeling are not sharply dis­
tinguished. Still we do not speak of the sensation of right, self-sensation, etc.
but of the feeling of right, self-feeling. Sensation is connected with sensitivity;
it seems plausible therefore that sensation emphasizes more the aspect of passiv­
ity, offinding, i.e. the immediacy of the determinacy in feeling, whereas feeling
looks more to the selfishness involved in it. 2 .
Zusatz. With what we have said in the preceding Paragraph, we have completed
the first part of Anthropology. In that part, we had at first to do with the wholly
qualitatively determined soul, or with soul in its immediate determinacy. By the
immanent advance of the development of our object we have finally arrived at the
soul which posits its determinacy ideally and in this returns to itself and becomes
for itself, i.e. the sentient individual soul. This gives us the transition to the second
part of Anthropology, a part as difficult as it is interesting and in which the soul
opposes its substantiality, confronts itself, and in its determinate sensations at
the same time attains to the feeling of itself or to the not yet objective, but only
subjective consciousness of its totality, and thus, since sensation is tied to the indi­
vidual, ceases to be merely sentient. In this part, because the soul here appears at
the standpoint of its rupture with itself, we have to consider it in its diseased state.
In this sphere, there prevails a contradiction between the freedom and unfree­
dom of the soul; for, on the one hand, soul is still fettered to its substantiality,
conditioned by its naturalness, while, on the other hand, it is already beginning
to separate itself from its substance, from its naturalness, and thus rises to the
intermediate stage between its immediate natural life and objective, free con­
sciousness. How far the soul now enters this intermediate stage we propose to
elucidate briefly here.3
Mere sensation, as we have just remarked, has to do only with what is individu­
al and contingent, with what is immediately given and present; and this content
appears to the sentient soul as its own concrete actuality. -When by contrast
I rise to the standpoint of consciousness, I enter into relationship with a world
outside me, with an objective totality, with an internally interconnected sphere of
manifold and complex objects confronting me. As objective consciousness I cer­
tainly have initially an immediate sensation, but at the same time what is thus
sensed is for me a point in the universal interconnection of things, something,
therefore, which points out beyond its sensory individuality and immediate pres­
ence. So little is objective consciousness tied to the sensory presence of things
that I can also be aware of something that is not sensibly present to me, as for
example a distant country familiar to me only through books. But conscious­
ness activates its independence from the material of sensation by raising it from
the form of individuality into the form of universality, omitting what is purely

Anthropology, The Soul

85

contingent and indifferent in it and holding on to the essential; by this trans­
formation, what is sensed becomes something represented. This alteration effected
by abstract consciousness is something subjective, which can go as far as wilfol­
ness and unreality, can generate representations with no actuality corresponding
to them.4-Now the soul that feels or glimpses itself in its totality and universality
and which we have now to consider in the second pan of Anthropology, stands
in the middle between representing consciousness on the one hand, and immedi­
ate sensation on the other. That the universal is sensed seems a contradiction; for
sensation as such has, as we know, only what is individual for its content. But
this contradiction does not affect what we call the feeling soul; for this is neither
involved in immediate sensory sensation and dependent on immediate, sensory pres­
ence, nor, conversely, is it related to the pure universal which is to be grasped only
through the mediation of pure thinking, but rather has a content that has not yet
developed as far as the separation of the universal and the individual, the sub­
jective and the objective. At this standpoint, what I sense, I am, and what I am,
I sense. I am here immediately present in the content, which only subsequently,
when I become objective consciousness, appears to me as a self-dependent world
confronting me. This content is still related to the feeling soul as accidents to
substance; the soul still appears as the subject and centre of all determinations
of content, as the power which in an immediate way reigns over the world of
feeling.5
Now the transition to the second pan of Anthropology makes itself more
determinate in the following way. First of all, we must note that the distinction
between external and internal sensations considered by us in the preceding Para­
graph is only for us, i.e., is for the reflecting consciousness, and is definitely not
for the soul itself. The simple unity of the soul, its serene ideality, does not yet
grasp itself in its distinction from an external reality. But though the soul has not
yet any consciousness of this its ideal nature, it is none the less the ideality or neg­
ativity of all the various kinds of sensations, each of which in the soul seems to be
for itself and indifferent to the others. Just as objectivity displays itself to our intu­
ition not as something separated out into different aspects, but as a concrete divided
into distinct objects, each of which is in turn for itself a concrete, a complex of
the most diverse determinations, so the soul itself is a totality of infinitely many
distinct determinacies which in the soul unite into one, so that in them the soul
remains, in itself, infinite being-for-itself. In this totality or ideality, in the timeless,
undifferentiated interior of the soul, the sensations which crowd each other out
do not, however, vanish absolutely without trace, but remain in the soul as sub­
fated, obtain in it their subsistence, as an initially merely possible content, which
only advances from its possibility to actuality by becomingfor the soul or by the
soul's becoming fo r itselfin it. Thus the soul retains the content of sensation,
even if not for itself, yet within itself. This preservation, relating only to a content
internalfor itself, to an affection of myself, to mere sensation, is still remote from
recollection proper, since this sets out from the intuition of an externally posited

86

Subjective Mind

object which is to be made internal, and here such an object, as already noted,
does not yet exist for the soul. 6
But there is yet another side to the soul's fulfilment besides the content that
already has been in sensation and of which we spoke initially. Besides this mater­
ial we are, as actual individuality, in ourselves also a world of concrete content
with an infinite periphery,-we have within us a countless host of relations and
connections which are always within us even if they do not enter into our sen­
sation and representation, and which, no matter how much these relations can
alter, even without our knowledge, none the less belong to the concrete content
of the human soul; so that the soul, in virtue of the infinite wealth of its content,
may be described as the soul of a world, as an individually determined world-soul.
Because the human soul is an individual soul, a soul determined on all sides and
therefore limited, it also stands in relationship to a universe determined in accord­
ance with the soul's individual standpoint. This counterpart of the soul is not
something external to it. On the contrary, the totality of relationships in which
the individual human soul stands, constitutes its actual vitality and subjectivity
and accordingly has grown together with it just as firmly as, to use an image, the
leaves grow with the tree; the leaves, though distinct from the tree, yet belong
to it so essentially that the tree dies if they are repeatedly torn off. Of course,
more self-dependent human natures that have attained to a life rich in deeds and
experience, are far better able to endure the loss of a part ofwhat constitutes their
world than people who have grown up in simple circumstances and are incapable
of continual striving; in people of this second type the feeling of being alive is
sometimes so firmly bound up with their native habitat that in foreign parts they
are stricken by home-sickness and resemble a plant which can thrive only in a
definite soil. All the same, the concrete self-feeling of even the strongest natures
requires a certain range of external relationships, an adequate piece, so to speak,
of universe; for without such an individual world the human soul, as we have
said, would have no actuality at all, would not attain to a determinately distinct
individuality.? But the human soul does not merely have natural differences, it dif
ferentiates itself within itself, separates its substantial totality, its individual world,
from itself, sets this over against itself as the subjective. Its aim here is that what
the mind is in itselfshould become for the soul or for the mind,- that the cosmos
contained, in itself, within the mind should enter into mind's comciousness. But
as we have likewise already noted, at the standpoint of soul, of the not yet free
mind, there is no place for objective consciousness, for awareness of the world as
a world actually projected out of myself. The feeling soul communes merely with
its internal determinations. The opposition between itself and that which is for
it, remains still enclosed within it. Only when the soul has negatively posited the
manifold, immediate content of its individual world, made it into a simple entity,
into an abstract universal, hence only when a pure universal is for the universality
of the soul and the soul has in this way developed into the I that is for itself, its
own object, into this self-related perfect universal (a development which the soul

Anthropowgy, The Soul

87

as such still lacks), only then, after reaching this goal, does the soul emerge from
its subjective feeling to genuinely objective consciousness; for it is only the I that is
for itself, liberated, at least in an abstract way initially, from immediate mater­
ial, that also allows the material the freedom of subsistence outside the I. What
we have therefore to consider up to the attainment of this goal, is the struggle
for liberation which the soul has to wage against the immediacy of its substantial
content in order to become completely in control of itself and corresponding to
its concept, - to make itself into what it is in itselfor by its concept, namely, into
that self-related, simple subjectivity existing in the I. 8 The elevation to this level
of development displays a sequence of three stages which can here be indicated
schematically in advance.
At the first stage we see the soul involved in the dreaming away and intimation
of its concrete natura/ life. In order to comprehend the wonder of this soul-form,
which in recent times has received universal attention, we must bear in mind that
here the soul still lies in immediate, undifferentiated unity with its objectivity.
The second stage is the standpoint of derangement, i.e. of the soul divided against
itself, on the one hand already in control of itself, on the other hand not yet in
control of itself, but held fast in an individual particularity in which it has its
actuality.
At the third stage finally, the soul becomes master of its natural individuality,
of its bodiliness, reduces this to a subservient means, and projects out of itself as an
objective world that content of its substantial totality which does not belong to its
bodiliness. Reaching this goal, the soul emerges in the abstract freedom of the I
and thus becomes consciousness.
But about all these stages we have to remark, as we already had to remark in
the case of the earlier stages of the soul's development, that here too activities of
mind which can only later be considered in their free shape, must be mentioned
in advance, since they are already at work in the feeling soul.9

(b) THE FEELING S O UL

§403
The feeling individual is the simple ideality, subjectivity, of sensation. What it
has to do is to posit its substantiality, its merely implicit fulfilment, as subjectiv­
ity, to take possession of itself, and to become for itself as the power over itself.
As feeling, the soul is no longer a merely natural, but an inward, individuality;
its being-for-self, which in the merely substantial totality is only formal, is to be
liberated and made independent. 1
[Remark] Nowhere else is it of such essential imponance for our understanding
to keep hold of the determination of ideality as it is in the case of the soul and
still more of the mind. Ideality is the negation of the real, but the real is also

Subjective Mind

88
stored up,

virtually retained, although it does not

exist.

It is this determination

that we have before us in respect of representations, memory. Every individual
is an infinite treasury of sensation-determinations, representations, information,
thoughts, etc.; yet

I am for all that an

entirely

simple entity, - a cavern without

determinations, in which all this is stored up, without existing. It is only when

I recall one representation, that I

bring it out of that interior to existence, before

consciousness. Sometimes, in sickness, representations or information, supposed
to have been forgotten years ago, because for all that time they have not been
brought into consciousness, once more come to light. They were not in our pos­
session, nor perhaps by such reproduction as occurs in sickness do they for the
future come into our possession; and yet they were in us and remain in us from
now on. Thus a person can never know how much information he really

him,

has in

even if he has forgotten it. It belongs not to his actuality, not to his sub­

jectivity as such, but only to his implicit being. The individuality is and remains
this

simple inwardness,

amidst all the determinacy and mediation of conscious­

ness that is later installed in it. 2 Here we must keep in mind that the soul to
which this simplicity belongs is at first the feeling soul, in which bodiliness is con­
tained, and we must resist the idea suggested by consciousness and the intellect,
that this bodiliness is a materiality outside the soul and with its parts external to
each other. Just as the number and

variety of representations does not establish an

asunderness and real plurality in the I, so the real apartness of bodiliness has no
truth for the feeling soul. As sentient, the soul is determined

immediately,

and

so in a natural and bodily way, but this asunderness and sensory multiplicity of
the bodily does not count for the soul, any more than it does for the concept,
as anything real, or therefore as a barrier. The soul is the

existent concept, the
omnipresent

existence of the speculative. Thus in the bodily the soul is simple,
unity. For representation the body is

one representation,

and the infinite variety

of its material structure and organization has won through to the

simplicity of a

determinate concept; similarly in the feeling soul, bodiliness, and all the asunder­
ness that belongs to its sphere, is reduced to
multiplicity. The soul is

in itself the

ideality,

to the

truth of the natural

totality of nature, as an individual soul it

is a monad; it is itself the posited totality of its

particular world,

so that this

world is included in it, its fulfilment; in relating to this world it relates only to
itself.3

§404
As

individual,

the soul is altogether

exclusive

and it posits difference

within itself

What is differentiated from it is not yet an external object, as in consciousness,
but only the determinations of its sentient totality. In this judgement, the soul
is the subject in general; its object is its

substance,

which is at the same time

its predicate. This substance is not the content of its natural life, but becomes
the content of the individual sensation-packed soul; but since the soul is in that

Anthropology, The Soul

89

content a t the same time particular, the content i s its panicular world, in s o far as
that world is, in an implicit way, included in the ideality of the subject. 1
[Remark] For itself, this stage of mind is the stage of its darkness: its determin­
ations do not develop to conscious and intelligent content; in this respect it is
altogether formal. It acquires a peculiar interest in so far as it becomes a form and
thus a state

(§380),

to which the soul that has already advanced to consciousness

and intellect, may again sink down. The more genuine form of the mind, existing
in a more subordinate and abstract form, involves a discrepancy, which is

ease.

dis­

In this sphere we must consider, first, the abstract formations of the soul for

themselves, and then consider them as diseased states of mind, since the latter can
only be understood in terms of the former. 2

(a) The Feeling Soul in its Immediacy

§405
(1) Initially the feeling individuality is

indeed a monadic individual, but, being

immediate, it is not yet Itself, not a subject reflected into itself, and is therefore
passive. Hence its selfish individuality is a subject different from it, a subject that
may even be another individual. In relation to this subject it takes the form of
a substance, which is only a dependent predicate; the subject's selfishness sets it
in vibration and determines it without the least resistance. This subject may be
called its genius. 1
[Remark] In immediate existence this is the relationship of the child in its moth­
er's womb,

al-a

a

relationship neither merely bodily nor merely mental, but psychic­

relationship of the soul. Here are two individuals, yet still in undivided

self, not yet impenetrable, incapable of resistance;
single self of both . -The mother is the genius of the

soul-unity: the one is still no
the other is its subject, the

child; for by genius we commonly mean the selfish totality of the mind, in so far
as it exists for

itself, and constitutes the subjective substantiality of another, which

is only externally posited as an individual; the latter has only a formal being-for­
self. The substance of the genius is the whole totality of reality, of life, and of
character, not as a mere possibility, or capacity, or in-itself, but as activity and
activation, as concrete subjectivity. 2
If we look only at the spatial and material aspects of the child's existence as an
embryo in its panicular integuments, etc. and of its connection with the moth­
er by means of umbilical cord, placenta, etc., all that is presented to the senses
and reflection is its external anatomical and physiological existence; for the essen­
tial matter, the psychical relationship, these sensory and material externalities and
mediations have no truth. What ought to be noted about this connection is not
merely the remarkable way in which determinations are communicated to and
stamped upon the child by violent emotions, inj uries, etc., of the mother, but the
whole psychical judgement of the substance, by which the female nature can (like

90

Subjective Mind

the monocotyledons in the vegetable kingdom) within itself break in two and in
which the child does not merely get by

communication,

but originally receives in

itself, susceptibility to illnesses as well as other predispositions of form, tempera­
ment, character, talent, idiosyncrasies, etc.3
Sporadic examples and traces of this

magic relationship appear elsewhere in the

area of sober conscious life, say between friends, especially female friends with
delicate nerves (a relationship which may develop into magnetic phenomena) ,
between husband and wife and between members of the same family.4
The totality of feeling has for its self a different subjectivity, which, in the
aforementioned form of immediate existence of this life of feeling, is also anoth­
er individual confronting it. But the totality of feeling is destined to elevate its
being-for-self out of itself to subjectivity in one and the same individuality; this
subjectivity is then its indwelling consciousness, sober, intelligent, and rational.
For such a consciousness the life of feeling is the substantial and merely impli­
cit material, whose rational, self-conscious, determining genius has become sober
subjectivity. But this nucleus, this being of feeling, contains not only the intrins­
ically unconscious predisposition, temperament, etc. but it also receives into its
enveloping simplicity (in habit, see below) all further ties and essential relation­
ships, fortunes, principles- in general everything belonging to the character, and
in whose elaboration self-conscious activity has played its most important pan.
The being of feeling is thus intrinsically a completely determinate soul. The total­
ity of the individual in this compressed form is distinct from the existing unfold­
ing of its consciousness, its view of the world, developed interests, inclinations,
etc. In contrast to this mediated asunderness this intensive form of individual­
ity has been called the genius, which has the final determination in the show of
mediations, intentions, reasons, in which the developed consciousness indulges.
This concentrated individuality also makes an appearance in the form of what is
called the

heart or breast. A man

is said to be heartless when he thinks and acts

with sober consciousness in accordance with his determinate purposes, whether
they be great substantial aims or petty and unjust interests; a good-hearted man
means rather one who gives free rein to the individuality of his feeling, even if it
is restricted in scope, and throws himself with his whole individuality into its par­
ticularities and is completely fulfilled by them. B ut of such a good nature it may
be said that it is not so much the genius itself as the policy of indulgeregenio. 5

Zusatz. What we described in the Zusatz to §402 as the soul involved in the
dreaming away and intimation of its individual world, has been called in the head­
ing of the above Paragraph 'the feeling soul in its immediacy'. We propose to
portray this developmental form of the human soul more determinately than we
did in the above Remark. Already in the Remark to

§404

it was said that the

stage of dreaming and intimation also constitutes a form to which, as a state of
disease, even the mind that has already developed into consciousness and intel­
lect can again relapse. Both modes of mind- healthy, intellectual consciousness

91

Anthropology, The Soul

on the one hand, dreaming and intimation o n the other- can now, in the first
developmental stage of the feeling soul here under discussion, exist as more or less

mutually interpenetrating,

since the peculiarity of this stage consists precisely in

the fact that here the dull, subjective or glimpsing consciousness is not yet posited
in

direct opposition

to the free, objective or intellectual consciousness, as it is at

the second stage of feeling soul, at the standpoint of derangement, but has rather
only the relationship to it of something different, of something therefore that

can
be mixedwith intellectual consciousness. Mind at this stage therefore does not yet
exist as the contradiction within its own self, the two sides which, in derangement,
fall into contradiction with each other still stand here in an unconstrained relation
to each other. This standpoint can be called the magical relationship of the feel­
ing soul, for with this expression one denotes a mediation-free relationship of the
inner to an outer or to an other in general. A magical force is one whose effect is
not determined by the interconnection, the conditions and mediations of object­

ive relationships; and 'the feeling soul in its immediacy' is such a force working
without mediation.6
For an understanding of this stage in the soul's development it will not be
superfluous to explain in more detail the concept of magic. Absolute magic would
be the magic of

mind as such.

This, too, exerts a magical infection on objects,

acts magically on another mind. But in this relationship immediacy is only one

moment;

mediation effected by thinking and intuition, as well as by speech and

gesture, forms the other moment in it. The child is, of course, infected in a pre­
dominantly immediate way by the mind of the adults it sees around it; at the same
time, however, this relationship is

mediated by consciousness and by the incipi­

ent independence of the child. Among adults, a superior mind exerts a magical
force over the weaker mind; thus, for example,

Lear over Kent, who

felt himself

irresistibly drawn to the unhappy monarch because the king seemed to him to
have something in his countenance which he, as he puts it, 'would fain call mas­
ter' . A similar answer, too, was given by a queen of France who, when accused
of having practised sorcery on her husband, replied that she had used no other
magical force against him than that which nature bestows on the stronger mind
over the weaker. In the cases cited, the magic consists in an immediate influence
of one mind on another mind, and generally in magic or sorcery, even when it
related to merely natural objects like the sun and moon, the idea has always been
in play that sorcery occurs essentially by the immediate operation of the force of
the mind, and in fact by the power of the

diabolical mind, not the divine mind,

so in the very same measure that someone possesses the power of sorcery, he is
subservient to the devil.?
Now the most mediation-free magic is more exactly that which the individual
mind exerts over its

own bodiliness, when it makes this a subservient, unresisting
animals man exerts an extremely mediation­

executant of its will. But also over

free magical force, for these cannot endure the gaze of man. 8

Subjective Mind

92

Besides the magical modes of mind's activity j ust cited, which

actually occur,
magical state

people have by contrast falsely ascribed to humankind a primitive

in which the mind of man, without developed consciousness, gained knowledge
quite immediately of the laws of external nature and of its own genuine essence,
and also of the nature of God, in a much more perfect manner than now. This
whole idea is quite as contrary to the

Bible as

to reason; for in the myth of the

Fall, the Bible expressly declares that knowledge of the truth was granted to man
only through the

disruption of that original paradisiac

unity of man with nature.

The fabled mass of primitive men's knowledge of astronomy and other matters
dwindles to nothing on closer examination. It can, of course, be said of the

teries

mys­

that they contain the remnants of an earlier knowledge; traces of reason

instinctively at work are found in the earliest and rudest times. But such instinct­
ive productions of human reason, lacking the form of thought, must not be taken
as proofs of a primitive scientific

knowledge; on the contrary, they are necessarily
umcientijic, belonging merely to sensation and intuition,
since science cannot be the alpha, only the omega. 9
So much for the essence of the magical in general. But as regards the precise way
in which it appears in the sphere of Anthropology, we here have to distinguish two
different forms of the magical relationship of the soul.
The first of these forms can be designated as theformal subjectivity oflife. This
subjectivity isformal, because far from laying a claim to what belongs to objective
consciousness, this subjectivity itself constitutes a moment of objective life. For
this reason it is no more something that ought not to be, something diseased, than,
something thoroughly

for example, cutting one's teeth; on the contrary, it is only to be expected in

a

healthy human being. Bur the formal nature, the undifferentiated simplicity, of
this subjectivity, at the same time implies that there. can be no question here even
of a relationship of two self-subsistentpersonalities to each other, let alone the direct

opposition

of subjective consciousness to objective consciousness, which is only

prevalent in derangement and is completely excluded here; such a relationship
will only present itself to us with the second form of the magical state of the soul.
The first form of this state to be discussed next contains, on its part, three dijferent states :
cxa) natural dreaming;
��) the life ofthe child in the womb; and
yy) the relatiomhip ofour conscious life to our secret inner life, to our determin­
ate mental nature, or to what has been called the genius of man. 1 0
wx) Dreaming. In dealing with the awaking o f the individual soul in §398 and
more precisely in establishing the determinate distinction between sleep and wak­
ing, we already had to speak of natural dreaming in anticipation, because this is a
moment of sleep, and on a superficial inspection

can

be regarded as proof of the

identical nature of sleep and waking; against this superficiality we had to insist on
the essential distinction between these two states even with regard to dreaming.

Anthropology, The Soul

93

But the proper place to consider the last-named soul-activity is with the begin­
ning made in

§405

of the development of the soul involved in the dreaming

away and intimation of its concrete natural life. Now since we refer here to what
has already been said in the Remark and

subjective

Zusatz to §398

about the thoroughly

nature of dreams, bereft of intellectual objectivity, the only thing we

have to add is that in the state of dreaming the human soul is filled not merely
with

individualized impressions but it attains,

more than is usually the case in the

whole indi­
vidual nature, of the entire compass of its past, present, and future; and that the
fact that the individual totality of the soul is sensed in this way is precisely the reas­

distractions of the waking soul, to a profound, powerful feeling of its

on why dreaming must be mentioned in our consideration of the soul that feels
itself. 1 1

��) The child in the womb.

Whereas i n dreaming the individual attaining to

the feeling of itself is involved in a simple,

immediate relation to itselfand this,

its

being-for-itself, has entirely the form of subjectivity, the child in the womb by
contrast shows us a soul that is actually for itself not in the child, but only in the
mother, and cannot yet suppon itself but is supponed only by the mother's soul;
so that here, instead of that simple relation of the soul to itselfpresent in dreaming,
there exists an equally simple, immediate relation to

another individual in whom

the still selfless soul of the foetus finds its self. For the intellect, with its inabil­
ity to comprehend the unity of what is distinct, there is something marvellous
in this relationship, for here we see an immediate merging of two lives, an undi­
vided soul-unity of two individuals, one of which is an

actual self that

is for its

own self, while the other has at least aformal being-for-self and comes ever closer
to actual being-for-self. But fo � philosophical thinking this undivided soul-unity
contains nothing incomprehensible, especially as the self of the child cannot yet
put up any resistance to the self of the mother, but is completely open to the
immediate influence of the mother's soul. This influence reveals itself in those
phenomena called

birthmarks. Much of what is classed under this heading may
organic cause. But as regards many physiological phenom­

of course have a purely

ena there can be no doubt that these are posited by the mother's sensation and
that, therefore, a psychical cause underlies them. There are, for example, repons
of children coming into the world with an injured arm because the mother either
had actually broken an arm or at least had knocked it so severely that she feared
it was broken, or, finally, because she had been scared by the sight of someone
else's broken arm. Similar

exam ples

are too familiar for many of them to need

to be cited here. Such an embodiment of the mother's inner impressions can be
explained on the one hand by the unresisting weakness of the foetus, and on the
other by the fact that in the mother enfeebled by pregnancy and no longer hav­
ing a completely independent life for itself but impaning her life to the child,
sensations acquire an unusual degree of vitality and strength, overpowering the
mother herself. To this power of the mother's sensation even the infant is still
very much subjected; unpleasant emotions can, as we know, spoil the mother's

Subjective Mind

milk and thus adversely affect the child suckled by her. On the other hand, in the
relationship of parents to their grown-up children something magical has in fact
shown itself whenever children and parents who had long been separated and did
not know each other, unconsciously felt a mutual attraction; we cannot say, how­
ever, that this feeling is anything universal and necessary, for there are examples
of fathers killing their sons in battle and sons their fathers, in circumstances where
they would have been able to avoid this killing, if they had had any suspicion of
their natural connection. I 2

yy) The relationship ofthe individual to its genius. The third way i n which the

human soul arrives at the feeling of its totality is the relationship of the individual
to its genius. By genius, we are to understand the particularity of the individual,
which in all situations and relationships decides its conduct and fate. That is to

twofold entity within myself: on the one hand, what I am aware of
external life and in my universal representations, and on
the other hand, what I am in my interior, determined in a particular way. This
particularity of my interior constitutes my destiny, for it is the oracle on whose

say,

I

am a

myself as being in my

pronouncement all resolutions of the individual depend; it forms the objectivity
which assens itself from out of the

interior of the individual's character. That the

circumstances and relationships in which the individual is situated turn his fate
in just

this

direction, and no other- this lies not merely in the circumstances

and relationships, in their peculiarity, nor even merely in the

universal nature of

the individual, but also in his panicularity. This determinate individual reacts
differently to the same circumstances from a hundred other individuals; cenain
circumstances

can

have a magical effect on one individual, while another indi­

vidual will not be forced by them off his usual path. Circumstances, therefore,
blend with the interior of individuals in a contingent, particular manner; so that
individuals become what becomes of them panly by circumstances and by what
is universally valid, and partly by their own panicular inner determination. Of
course, the panicularity of the individual provides grounds, thus

universally valid

determinations, for its acts and omissions; but it always does this only in a par­
ticular way, since its attitude here essentially involves feeling. Consequently, even
wide-awake, intellectual consciousness operating in universal determinations is
determined by its genius in such an overpowering manner that the individual
here appears in a relationship of dependency, a relationship that can be compared
to the dependence of the foetus on the mother's soul, or to the passive way in
which the soul, in dreams, attains to the representation of its individual world.
But on the other hand, the relationship of the individual to his genius is distin­
guished from the two relationships of the feeling soul considered earlier, by the
fact that it is their unity, that it unites into one the moment of the simple unity
of the soul with itself contained in

natural dreaming,

and the moment of the

present in the relationship of the foetus to the mother, since
the genius, on the one hand, is a selfish other confronting the individual, like the
mother's soul in relation to the foetus, and, on the other hand, forms a unity with

duality of soul-life

§406
(2)

The life of feeling, when it becomes a form, a

state,

of the self-conscious,

educated, sober human being, is a disease, in which the individual stands in

unmediated relationship with the concrete content of its own self and has its sober
consciousness of itself and of the intelligibly ordered world as a state distinct from
its feeling-life. This is seen in

magnetic somnambulism and related states . 1

[Remark] In this summary encyclopaedic exposition i t is impossible t o supply
what would need to be supplied for a proof of the determination we have given
of the remarkable state aroused chiefly by animal magnetism, to show, in other
words, that the experiences correspond to it. For this the phenomena, intrins­
ically so complex and so very different one from another, would have first of
all to be brought under their universal points of view. The facts, it might seem,
are above all in need of verification. But such a verification would, after all, be
superfluous for those on whose behalf it was needed; for they make the inquiry
extremely easy for themselves by flatly declaring the accounts- infinitely numer­
ous though they be and authenticated by the education, character, etc., of the
witnesses- to be mere deception and imposture. They are so fixed in their a pri­

ori intellect

that no authentication can make any headway against it, and they

have even denied what they have seen with their own eyes. In order to believe in
this area even what one sees with one's own eyes, and still more to comprehend
it, the first requisite is not to be in bondage to the categories of the intellect. 2 The
main points of imponance may be given here:

a a)

To the

concrete being of an individual belongs the entirety of his funda­

mental interests, the essential and the panicular empirical relationships in which
he stands to other men and to the world at large. This totality constitutes
actuality, in the sense that it is

us. This

immanent in

his

him; j ust now we called it his geni­

genius is not the free mind that wills and thinks; the form of feeling, in

which the individual under consideration here is immersed, is, on the contrary,
a surrender of his existence as mental self-possession. The first conclusion to be
drawn from the account we have given bears on the

content:

in somnambulism

only the sphere of the individually determined world, of panicular interests and
restricted relationships, enter into consciousness. Scientific discoveries or philo­
sophical concepts and universal truths require a different terrain, thinking that
has developed out of the haze of feeling life to free consciousness. It is foolish to
expect revelations about Ideas from the somnambulist state.3

��)

The man of sound sense and intellect is aware in a self-conscious, intel­

ligent way of this actuality of his which makes up the concrete fulfilment of his
individuality; he has an alen awareness of it in the form of the interconnection
between himself and the determinations of that actuality as an external world

96

Subjective Mind

distinct from himself, and he is similarly aware of this world as a network ofintel­
ligible interconnectiom. In his subjective ideas and plans he has also before his eyes
these intelligible interconnexions of his world and the mediation of his ideas and
purposes with the objective existences, which are thoroughly mediated among
themselves (c£ §398 Remark) . At the same time, this world outside him has its
threads in him in such a way that what he actually is for himself, consists of these
threads; so that he too would die away internally together with the disappearance
of these externalities, unless religion, subjective reason, and character make him
more expressly self-supponing and independent of them. In this case he is less
susceptible to the form of the state of which here we speak. For the phenomenon
of that identity we can recall the effect that the death of beloved relatives, friends,
etc. can have on those left behind, so that the one dies or fades away with the
loss of the other. (Thus Cato, after the downfall of the Roman republic, could
live no longer: his inner actuality was neither wider nor higher than it.) Compare
home-sickness, and the like. 4
yy) But when the fulfilment of consciousness, its external world and its rela­
tionship to that world, is under a veil, and the soul is thus sunk in sleep (in
magnetic sleep, catalepsy, and other diseases, for example, those connected with
female development, or at the approach of death, etc.) , then that immanent actu­
ality of the individual remains the same substantial totality in the form of a life
offeeling, which is inwardly seeing, inwardly aware. Because it is the developed,
adult, educated consciousness which is reduced to this state of feeling, it does
retain along with its content the formality of its being-for-self, a formal intu­
ition and awareness, which, however, does not get as far as the judgement of
consciousness by which the content of consciousness, when it is healthy and
awake, presents itself to it as outer objectivity. The individual is thus a monad
which is inwardly aware of its actuality, the self-intuition of the genius. Thus the
characteristic feature in such awareness is that the individual can be immediately
aware of, intuit, the content in this immanence-the very same content which
is objective for healthy consciousness as intelligible actuality, and to be aware of
which consciousness in its sober state needs intelligible mediation in the whole
of its real expansion. This intuition is a son of clairvoyance; for it is awareness in
the unseparated substantiality of the genius, and is situated in the essential core of
the interconnexion, and so is not subject to the series of mediating conditions,
external one to another, which sober consciousness has to go through and in view
of which it is restricted in its own external individuality. But such clairvoyance,
because, in its hazy obscurity, the content is not set out in an intelligible inter­
connection, is at the mercy of all its own contingency of feeling, of imagining,
etc., not to mention that ideas of others (see below) intrude into its vision. It is
thus impossible to make out whether clairvoyants see correctly more than they
get wrong, or vice versa. - But it is absurd to regard this visionary state as an

elevation of the mind and as a more genuine state, inherently capable of discover­
ing universal truths.* 5

��) An essential determination in this life of feeling, which lacks the intel­
lect and will of a person, is this: it is a

state of passivity,

like that of the child in

the womb. The diseased subject accordingly falls into, and after the state con­
tinues in,

the power ofanother,

the magnetizer; so that when the two are in this

psychical connexion, the selfless individual, not actually a person, has for his sub­
jective consciousness the consciousness of the self-possessed individual, that this
other individual is its current subjective soul, its genius, which can even fill it
with content. That the somnambulistic individual senses in himself tastes and
smells which are present in the individual with whom he is in rapport, that he is
aware of his other current intuitions and inner ideas, but as if they were his own,
shows the substantial identity with another, which the soul (which even in its con­
creteness is genuinely immaterial) is capable of. In this substantial identity there
is only one subjectivity of consciousness, and the individuality of the patient is
indeed a being-for-self, but it is an empty being-for-self, not present to itself, not
actual; this formal self accordingly has its fulfilments in the sensations and ideas
of the other, it sees, smells, tastes, reads, and hears also in the other. It is fur­

ther to be noted on this point that the somnambulist in this way comes to stand
in a relationship with two genii and a twofold content, his own and that of the
magnetizer. Which sensations or visions he, in this formal perception, receives,
intuits, and brings to awareness from his own interior, and which from the rep­
resentation of the individual with whom he stands in rapport, is indeterminate.
This uncertainty may be the source of many deceptions, and accounts among
other things for the diversity that has inevitably come to light among somnambu­
lists from different countries and in rapport with persons of different education,
as regards their views on diseased states and ways of curing them, on medicines, as
well as on scientific and intellectual categories, etc.?

ee) In this feeling substantiality the contrast to external objectivity is absent.
Similarly

within itself the subject has a unity, in which the particularities of feel­

ing have disappeared, so that, when the activity of the sense-organs is asleep, the

*
Plato had a better understanding of the relationship of prophecy in general to sober conscious
awareness than do many modems, who were quick to suppose that in Platonic conceptions of
enthusiasm they had found an authority for their belief in the sublimity of the revelations of
somnambulistic vision. In the Timaeus (Stephanus edition, Ill, pp. 71 £) Plato says that to give the
irrational parr of the soul also some degree of patticipation in the truth, God created the liver and
gave it manteia, the capacity for having apparitions. Of God's having given this power of prophecy
to human irrationality, there is, he adds, this sufficient proof: no man in his right mind is blessed with
a genuine apparition, unless his intellect is fettered in sleep or distracted by illness or an enthusiasm.
'What was said long ago is correct: to play one's own pan and to know oneself is the privilege of
sobriety'. Plato notes quite correctly the bodily aspect of such vision and awareness, and also the
possibility of the truth of apparitions - but also their subordination to rational consciousness.6

98

Subjective Mind

common feeling adapts itself to the particular functions; one sees, hears, etc. with
the fingers, and especially with the pit of the stomach. 8
To comprehend means, for intellectual reflexion, to recognize the series of medi­
ations between a phenomenon and another reality with which it is connected, to
discern what is called the course of nature, i.e. in accordance with the laws and
relationships of the intellect, for example, causality, grounds, etc. The life of feel­
ing, even when it still retains a merely formal awareness, as in the diseased states
mentioned, is just that form of immediacy, in which the distinctions of the sub­
jective and objective, of intelligent personality in contrast to an external world,
and those relationships of finitude between them, are absent. The comprehen­
sion of this interconnexion, devoid of relationships and yet completely fulfilled,
is made intrinsically impossible by the presupposition of independent personalit­
ies, contrasting with each other and with the content in the form of an objective
world, and by the presupposition of the absoluteness of spatial and material asun­
derness in general.9
Zusatz. In the Zusatz to §405 we said that two different forms of the magical
relationship of the feeling soul are to be distinguished and that the first of these
forms can be called the formal subjectivity oflife. Consideration of this first form
was concluded in the Zusatz just mentioned. We therefore now have to consider
the second form of that magical relationship, namely the real subjectivity of the
feeling soul. We call this subjectivity real because here, instead of the inseparable,
substantial soul-unity dominant in dreaming and also in the state of the foetus
and in the relationship of the individual to his genius, there emerges an actu­
ally twofold soul-life, which releases its two sides to a peculiar reality of their own.
The first of these two sides is the unmediated relationship of the feeling soul to
its individual world and substantial actuality; the second side, by contrast, is the
mediated relation of the soul to its objectively interconnected world. When these
two sides diverge and break loose from their reliance on each other, this must be
designated an illness, since this divergence, in contrast to the modes of formal
subjectivity considered in the Zusatz to §405, does not constitute a moment of
objective life itself. Just as bodily illness consists in the fixation of an organ or
system in opposition to the universal harmony of the individual life and such
obstruction and separation sometimes advances so far that the particular activ­
ity of a system makes itself into a centre concentrating into itself the rest of the
organism's activity, into a rampant growth, so too in the soul-life illness results if
the merely soulfol side of the organism, becoming independent of the power of
mental consciousness, usurps the latter's function and the mind, in losing control
of the soulful component belonging to it, no longer remains in command of itself
but itself sinks to the form of the soulful and in this way surrenders the objective
relationship to the actual world essential to the sound mind, i.e., the relationship
mediated by sublation of what is externally posited. That it is possible for the
soulful side to become independent in relation to the mind and even to usurp its

Anthropology, The Soul

99

function lies in the fact that the soulful is both distinct from the mind and in itself

identical with

it. When it separates from the mind and posits itself for itself, the
soulful gives itself the semblance of being what the mind in truth is, namely, the

soul that is for itself in the form of universality. But the
that separation is not merely to be
less

illness ofsoul arising from
compared with bodily illness, but is more or

bound up with it, because when the soulful breaks loose from the mind, the

bodiliness necessary for the empirical existence of the mind as well as of the soul­
ful, is divided between these two diverging sides and accordingly itself becomes

something separated within itself and therefore diseased. l O

Now the diseased states in which such a separation of the soulful from mental
consciousness emerges are very varied in kind; almost any illness can advance to
the point of this separation. But here in the philosophical treatment of our sub­
ject we do not have to pursue this indeterminate multiplicity of diseased states
but only to establish the

main forms of the universal which shapes

in various ways. Among the illnesses in which this universal

earl

itself in them

appear are sleep­

walking, catalepsy, the onset ofpuberty in young women, the state ofpregnancy, also
St Vitus s dance, and the moment of approaching death as well, if death brings
about the relevant splitting of life into a weakening healthy, mediated conscious­
ness and a soulful awareness approaching ever closer to complete ascendancy; but
especially we must examine here the state which has been called animal magnet­

ism, both when it develops

by itselfin an individual and when it is produced in a
particular manner in the individual by another individual. Mental causes, particu­

larly religious and political exaltation, can also bring about the relevant separation
of soul-life. In the war of the Cevennes, for example, the free emergence of the
soulful showed up as a prophetic gift present to a high degree in children, in girls
and especially in old people. But the most remarkable example of such exaltation
is the famous feanne

d'Arc,

in whom we

earl

see, on the one hand, the patriotic

enthusiasm of a quite pure, simple soul and, on the other, a kind of magnetic
state. 1 1
After these preliminary remarks we propose to consider here the main indi­
vidual forms in which a divergence of the soulful and objective consciousness
shows up. We hardly need recall here what we have already said about the dif­
ference between these two modes of man's response to his world: namely, that

objective consciousness is aware of the world as an objectivity external to it, infin­
itely manifold, but at all its points necessarily interconnected, containing nothing
unmediated within it; and it responds to the world in a corresponding way, i.e.,
in an equally manifold, determinate, mediated, and necessary way, and is therefore
able to enter into relation with a determinate form of external objectivity only by
a determinate sense organ, for example, is able to see only with the ryes; where­
as feeling, or the su�jective mode of awareness, can dispense wholly, or at least in
part, with the mediations and conditions indispensable to objective awareness,
can, for example, perceive visible things without the aid of the eyes and without
the mediation oflight.

1 00

Subjective Mind

crcr) This immediate awareness appears first and foremost in so-called metal­
water-diviners. By this we understand people who in a fully waking state,

and

without the mediation of the sense of sight, detect metal or water lying under
the ground. The not infrequent occurrence of such people is beyond any doubt.
he assures us, discovered this peculiarity of feeling in more than
four hundred individuals, some of them entirely healthy. 1 2 Besides metal and

Amoretti has,

water, salt is also sensed by some people with no mediation at all, since salt, if it
is present in a large quantity, arouses nausea and uneasiness in them. In looking
for hidden water and metals, and salt too, individuals of the type we have in mind
also employ a divining-rod. This is a hazel twig shaped like a fork, the two prongs
being held in both hands and the other end bending down towards the objects
j ust mentioned. It goes without saying that this movement of the wood does not
somehow have its ground in the wood itself bur is determined solely by the sensa­
tion of the individual; just as, in what is called pendulation too - although here,
in case of the application of several metals, a certain reciprocal action between
them can take place - the sensation of the individual is always the main determ­
inant; for if, for example, one holds a gold ring over a glass of water and the ring
strikes the rim of the glass as many times as the dock shows hours, this stems
solely from the fact that if, for example, eleven o'clock strikes and I know that
it is eleven o'clock, my knowing this is sufficient to stop the pendulum. - But
feeling, armed with the divining-rod, is supposed to have occasionally extended
beyond the discovery of dead natural things and especially to have served for
detecting thieves and murderers. However much charlatanism there may after
all be in the stories available about this point, some of the cases mentioned in
them seem worthy of credence, particularly, for example, the case in which a
French farmer living in the seventeenth century was suspected of murder, and
when taken into the cellar where the murder had been committed, there broke
out in a cold sweat and got a feeling of the murderers in virtue of which he detec­
ted the route they had taken on their flight and the places they had stayed at. He
discovered one of the murderers in a prison in southern France and pursued the
second up to the Spanish frontier where he was forced to turn back. Such an indi­
vidual has a sensation as sharp as a dog which follows its master's trail for miles.
��) The second phenomenon to be considered here of immediate or feeling
awareness, has this in common with the first just discussed: in both an object is
sensed without the mediation of the

specific sense

to which the object is mainly

related. But at the same time, this second phenomenon is distinguished from the
first by the fact that in it a response takes place that is not so entirely unmedi­
ated as in the first, since the specific sense in question is replaced either by the

common sense active

mainly in the pit of the stomach, or by the sense of touch.
Such feeling is displayed both in catalepsy in general, a state in which the organs

are paralysed, and especially in sleep-walking, a kind of cataleptic state in which
dreaming expresses itself not merely in speech bur also in walking about and gives
rise to other actions, underlying which there is an often accurate feeling of the

101

Anthropology, The Soul

relationships o f surrounding objects. As regards the emergence o f this state, it
can be produced, when there is a determinate disposition to it, by purely external
things, tor example, by certain foods eaten in the evening. After the emergence
of this state, the soul remains j ust as dependent on external things; for example,
the sound of music near sleep-walkers has induced them to recite whole novels
in their sleep. But with regard to the activity of the senses in this state, it must
be noted that proper sleep-walkers may well

hear and feel,

but that their

eye by

contrast, whether it is open or shut, is fixed, that therefore the sense for which, in

distance from me necessary for the genuine rela­
separation
of the subjective and objective is not present. As already noted, in sleep-walking
sight is extinguished and replaced by the sense of feeling-a replacement that
particular, objects recede to the

tionship of consciousness, ceases to be active in this state, where the

also occurs in really blind people, only to a lesser extent, and, incidentally, in
both cases must not be understood to mean that by the dulling of one sense
an intensification accrues to the other sense in a purely physical way, since this
intensification rather arises merely from the soul's throwing itself into the sense of
feeling with undivided force. However, the sense of feeling by no means always
guides sleep-walkers correctly; their complex actions are a contingent matter.
Such persons do occasionally write letters in their sleep-walking; often however
they are deceived by their feeling, when they believe for

exam ple

that they are

mounted on a horse when in fact they are on a roof. But besides the marvellous
intensification of the sense of feeling, in cataleptic states, as also already noted,
the

common sense too,

mainly in the pit

ofthe stomach, reaches such a degree of
hearing, or even taste. Thus at a

heightened activity that it takes the place of sight,

time when animal magnetism was not yet well-known, a French doctor in Lyons
treated a sick person who could hear and read only in the pit of his stomach and
who could read a book held by someone in another room who was put in contact
with the individual standing by the pit of the sick person's stomach by a chain of
persons standing in between, as arranged by the doctor. Such seeing at a distance
has, incidentally, been described in various ways by those in whom it occurred.
They often say that they see the objects

internally,

or they assert that it seems to

them as if the objects emitted rays. But as regards the above-mentioned replace­
ment of

taste

by the

common sense,

there are instances of persons' tasting food

placed on their stomachs. l 3

yy ) The third phenomenon o f immediate awareness i s this. Without the
involvement of any specific sense and without the

common sense becoming active
indeterminate sensation gives rise to an
intimation or clairvoyance, a vision of something not sensibly near but distant in
space or in time, of something fo ture or past. Now though it is often difficult
to distinguish merely subjective visions relating to non-existent objects from those
in an individual part of the body, an

visions which have something actual for their content, yet this distinction must
be maintained here. The first kind of vision too does occur in somnambulism,
but mostly in a predominantly physical state of illness, for example in the heat of

Subjective Mind

1 02

a fever, even in waking consciousness.

An

example of such a subjective vision

is Friedrich Nicolai, who, in a waking srate, saw with perfectly clarity other
houses in the street than those actually present there, and yet knew that this
was an illusion. The predominantly physical ground of the poetic illusion of
this otherwise thoroughly prosaic individual revealed itself when the illusion was
dispelled by the application ofleeches to the rectum.I4
But in our anthropological consideration we have to keep in view mainly the
second kind of visions, those which relate to actually existent objects. In order to
comprehend the wonder of the phenomena belonging here it is important to bear
in mind the following points regarding our view of the soul.
The soul is the all-pervading, not existing merely in a particular individual; for
as we have already said earlier, the soul must be conceived as the truth, as the
ideality, of everything material, as the

entirely universal in which all differences are
ideal and which does not one-sidedly confront the Other, but overarches the
Other. 1 5 But the soul is, at the same time, an individual soul, determined in a par­
ticular way; it has therefore various determinations or particularizations within

only

itself; these appear, for example, as urges and inclinations. These determinations,
though distinct from each other, are nevertheless for themselves only something

universal. Only in me as a determinate individual do they first acquire a determ­
inate content. Thus, for example, love for parents, relatives, friends, etc. becomes
individualized in me; for I cannot be a friend, etc. in general, I am necessarily this
friend living with these friends in this place at this time and in this situation. All
the universal soul-determinations individualized in me and experienced by me
constitute my actuality, are therefore not left to my discretion but rather form
the powers of my life and belong to my actual being j ust as much as my head or
my breast belong to my living embodiment. I

am

this whole circle of determin­

ations: they have coalesced with my individuality; each individual point in this
circle- for example, the fact that I am now sitting here -shows itself exempt
from the wilfulness of my representation by the fact that it is placed in the total­
ity of my self-feeling as a link in a chain of determinations or, in other words, is
embraced by the feeling of the totality of my actuality. But in so far as I am at
first only a feeling soul, not yet waking, ftee self-consciousness, I am aware of this

wholly immediate, quite abstractly
positive manner, since, as already noted, at this standpoint I have not yet detached
actuality of mine, of this world of mine, in a

the world from myself, not yet posited it as an external entity, and my awareness
of it is therefore not yet

mediated by the opposition of the subjective and objective

and by sublation of this opposition.16
The

content of this

clairvoyant awareness, we must now determine in more

detail.

(1)

First, there are states in which the soul is aware of a content it had long

since forgotten and which, in waking, it is no longer able to bring into conscious­
ness. This phenomenon occurs in various illnesses. The most striking phenomen­
on of this kind is when, in illnesses, people talk in a language which, though they

1 03

Anthropology, The Soul

have studied it in early youth, they can no longer speak in their waking state. It
also happens that common folk, who normally are used to speaking only Low
German with ease, in the magnetic state speak in High German without effort.

An

equally indisputable case is where people in such a state recite with perfect

facility something they had read a considerable time before, which they have nev­
erlearned by rote and which has vanished from their waking consciousness. For
instance, someone recited from Young's

Night Thoughts a long passage of which

he no longer knew anything when awake. l l A particularly remarkable instance
too is a boy who, while quite young, was operated on for a brain injury caused by
a fall and gradually lost his memory until he no longer knew what he had done an
hour earlier; when put into a magnetic state, however, he regained his memory so
completely that he could state the cause of his illness, the instruments used in the
operation he had undergone, and the persons who had participated in it.

(2)

But what can seem even more wonderful than the awareness, j ust con­

interior of the soul, is the unme­
diated awareness of events which are still external to the feeling subject. For with

sidered, of a content already deposited in the

respect to this second content of the clairvoyant soul, we know that the existence
of the external is tied to space and time, and our ordinary consciousness is mediated
by these two forms of asunderness.
First, as regards what is spatially distant from us, we can be aware of it in so far
as we are waking consciousness only on condition that we sub late the distance in
a mediated way. But this condition does not obtain for the clairvoyant soul. Space
pertains not to the soul but to external nature; and this externality, in being appre­
hended by the soul, ceases to be spatial, since, transformed by the soul's ideality,
it remains external neither to itself nor to us. Consequently, when free intellec­
tual consciousness sinks to the form of the merely feeling soul, the subject is no
longer tied to space. Instances of this independence of the soul from space have
occurred in great number. Here we must distinguish two cases. Either the events
are absolutely external to the clairvoyant subject who is aware of them without any
mediation; or, on the contrary, they have already begun to acquire for the subject
the form of something

internal,

therefore of something

non- alien to it, of some­

thing mediated, through being known in an entirely objective manner by another
subject, between whom and the clairvoyant individual there subsists such a com­
plete unity of souls that what is in the objective consciousness of the former also
penetrates the soul of the latter. We have to consider the form of clairvoyance
mediated by the consciousness of another subject only later, with the magnetic
state proper. Here, however, we must deal with the first-mentioned case, that of
thoroughly unmediated awareness of spatially remote, external events. 1 8
Instances of this kind of clairvoyance occurred more frequently i n earlier times,
in times of a more soulful life, than in the modern period in which the inde­
pendence of the intellectual consciousness has developed much further. The old
chronicles, which are not to be too hastily charged with error and falsehood,
relate many a case coming under this heading. In the intimation of the spatially

Subjective Mind

1 04

distant the consciousness can, by the way, be at one time more obscure, at another
more lucid. This fluctuation in the clarity of clairvoyance was shown, for example,
in a girl who had a brother in Spain but in her waking consciousness did not
know this; in her clairvoyance she saw this brother in a hospital, at first only
indistinctly, but then clearly; after that she believed she saw him dead and opened
up, but subsequently alive again; and, as emerged later, she had seen correctly, in
that at the time of her vision her brother had actually been in a hospital at Vallad­
olid, but that she was mistaken in thinking she saw him dead, since it was not this
brother who had died but another person next to him at the time. In Spain and
Italy, where the natural life of man is more universal than with us, visions such as
the one just mentioned, especially visions had by women and friends relating to
distant friends and husbands, are not a rarity.
But, secondly, the clairvoyant soul also rises above the condition of time, just
as it rises above the condition of space. We have already seen above that the soul
in the state of clairvoyance can make present to itselfagain something completely
removed from its waking consciousness by time gone by. A more interesting ques­
tion, however, for representation is whether people are also able to be lucidly
aware of what is separated from them by future time. To this question we have
the following reply. First and foremost we can say that, just as representation­
al consciousness errs when it holds the above-discussed clairvoyant vision of an

individuality entirely removed by its

spatial distance

from the bodily eye, to be

something better than the awareness of truths of reason, so representation is
involved in a similar error when it imagines that a perfectly certain and intellec­
tual awareness of the fUture would be something very sublime, and that we have
to look around for grounds to console ourselves for our lack of such an awareness.
On the contrary, it must be said that it would drive one to despair with bore­
dom to be aware in advance of one's fortunes with complete determinacy and
then to live through them in each and every detail in succession. But a foreknow­
ledge of this kind belongs among the impossibilities; for what is still only in the

future and therefore something that is merely in itself, simply cannot become an
object ofperceptual intellectual consciousness, since only what exists, only what has
attained to the individuality of sensory presence, is perceived. The human mind
is, of course, able to rise above an awareness concerned exclusively with sensibly
present individuality; but the absolute elevation over it only takes place in the con­
ceptual cognition ofthe eternal; for the eternal, unlike the sensory individual, is not
affected by the alternation of coming-to-be and passing-away and is, therefore,
neither past nor future, but the absolutely present, raised above time and con­
taining sublated within itself all distinctions of time. In the magnetic state, by
contrast, only a conditioned elevation above the awareness of what is immediately
present can occur; the foreknowledge revealed in this state always relates only
to the

individual sphere

of clairvoyant's existence, particularly to his individual

disposition to disease, and does not have, as regards form, the

connection and determinate certainty of objective,

necessary inter­

intellectual consciousness. The

Anthropowgy, The Soul

1 05

clairvoyant is in a concentrated state and intuits this veiled, pregnant life of his in
a concentrated way. In the determinacy of this concentration, the determinations
of space and time are also contained under a veil. However, these forms of asun­
derness are not apprehended for themselves by the clairvoyant's soul immersed
in its inwardness; this happens only on the pan of objective consciousness set­
ting its actuality over against itself as an external world. But since the clairvoyant
is at the same time a representer he must also display these determinations veiled
in his concentrated life or, what is the same, cast out his state into the forms of
space and time, in general lay it out in the manner of waking consciousness. It
is evident from this in what sense the clairvoyant foreboding has within itself a
mediation of time, while, on the other hand, it does not need this mediation
and is for that very reason able to penetrate into the future. But the quantum of
future time involved in the intuited state is not something fixed for itself, but a
mode and manner of the quality of the glimpsed content, -something belong­
ing to this quality, just as, for example, the period of three or four days belongs
to the determinacy of the nature of fever. Displaying this time-quantum con­
sists, therefore, in entering and developing the intensity of what is clairvoyantly
seen. Now in this development endless deception is possible. The time is never
indicated exactly by clairvoyants; on the contrary, for the most part the state­
ments of such people relating to the future come to nothing, especially if these
visions have for their content happenings dependent on the free will of other per­
sons. That clairvoyants are so often deceived on the point in question is quite
natural; for they intuit a future event only according to their quite indeterm­
inate, contingent sensation, which in these circumstances is determined in one
way, but in other circumstances is determined in another way, and then expound
the intuited content in an equally indeterminate and contingent manner. On
the other hand, however, the occurrence of extremely marvellous forebodings
and visions of this kind which have actually been confirmed can of course by
no means be denied. Thus persons have been awakened and impelled to leave a
room or a house by a foreboding of the collapse of a house or a ceiling, which
afterwards actually occurred. Sailors, too, are said sometimes to be gripped by
a non-deceptive presentiment of a storm of which the intellectual consciousness
does not yet notice the slightest sign. It is also asserted that many people have
predicted the hour of their death. Abundant instances of premonitions of the
future are found especially in the Scottish Highlands, in Holland, and in West­
phalia. Particularly among the Scottish mountain-dwellers the faculty of so-called
second sight is even now not uncommon. Persons endowed with this faculty see
themselves double, catch sight of themselves in conditions and circumstances in
which they will find themselves only subsequently. In explanation of this marvel­
lous phenomenon the following may be said. As has been remarked, in Scotland
'second sight' used to be much more common than it is now. For its emergence
therefore a peculiar stage of mental development seems to be necessary, in fact
a stage equally distant from a state of savagery and from a state of advanced

Subjective Mind

1 06

culture, where people do not pursue any
in their

individual circumstances,

universal aims but are interested only
contingent, particular aims in

carry out their

indolent imitation of inherited tradition without deep insight into the nature of
the circumstances to be dealt with, hence, unconcerned about knowledge of the
universal and necessary, they attend only to the

individual and contingent.

Just

because of this immersion of mind in what is individual and contingent people
often seem to become competent in seeing an

individual event still hidden in the

future, particularly if the event is not a matter of indifference to them. However,
it goes without saying, for these as for similar phenomena, that philosophy can­
not set out to try to explain all the individual circumstances, which often are not
properly authenticated but, on the contrary, extremely doubtful; we must rather
restrict ourselves in a philosophical treatment, as we have done in the above, to
bringing out the main points to bear in mind when looking at the phenomena in
question. 1 9

(3)

( 1 ) , the soul enclosed in
already belonging to it,
and whereas by contrast in the material discussed under (2) the soul is immersed
in the vision of an individual external circumstance, in the third case the soul, in
clairvoyant awareness of its own interior, of its state of soul and physical body,
Now whereas i n the intuition considered under

its inwardness only makes present to itself again a content

returns from this relation to something external back to itself. This side of clair­
voyance has a very wide range and can also attain to a considerable clarity and
determinacy. However, clairvoyants will be able to give any perfectly determinate
and correct information about their corporeal state only when they are medically
trained, hence possess in their waking consciousness an exact knowledge of the
nature of the human organism. From medically untrained clairvoyants, by con­
trast, one cannot expect any completely accurate anatomical and physiological
information; such persons have, on the contrary, extreme difficulty in translat­
ing the concentrated intuition which they have of their corporeal state into the
form of intellectual thinking, and they can always elevate what they see only into
the form of their waking consciousness, i.e. of a more or less vague and ignor­
ant consciousness. But j ust as in different clairvoyant individuals the immediate
awareness of their corporeal state is very different, so a great difference also obtains
in the intuitive knowledge of their

mental interior,

both as regards the form and

in respect of the content. In clairvoyance- since this is a state in which the sub­
stantiality of the soul emerges- to

noble natures

a fullness of noble sensation,

their true self, man's better mind is disclosed, and often appears to them as a par­
ticular protecting spirit.

Base people, by contrast, reveal in this state their baseness

and abandon themselves to it unreservedly. Finally, individuals of middling worth
often go through an ethical struggle with themselves during clairvoyance, since in
this new life, in this serene inner vision, the more important and nobler aspect of
a character emerges and turns destructively on its defects.

eal

In addition to the intuitive awareness of one's

own

mental and corpor­

state, there is a fourth phenomenon: clairvoyant knowledge of the state of

Anthropology, The Soul

1 07

someone else's soul and corporeal body. This case occurs panicularly in magnet­
ic somnambulism when, through the rappon set up between the subject in this
state and another subject, their two spheres of life have become, as it were, a single
life-sphere.
(5) Finally, when this rappon attains the highest degree of intimacy and
strength, there occurs, fifthly, the phenomenon in which the clairvoyant subject
knows, sees, and feels, not merely about, but in another subject and, without
directly attending to the other individual, immediately shares his sensations of
everything that happens to him, has within himself the sensations of the
other's individuality as his own. There are the most striking examples of this
phenomenon. A French doctor, for instance, treated two women who had a deep
affection for each other and who, although a considerable distance apan, sensed
each other's states of illness inside each other. We can also include here the case
of the soldier whose mother had been tied up by thieves; although he was some
distance away from her, he shared her sensation of anguish with such intensity
that he felt an irresistible impulse to hasten to her without delay.
The five phenomena discussed above are the principal moments of clairvoyant
awareness. They all have in common the determination of always relating to the
individual world of the feeling soul. This relation does not, however, establish
such an inseparable connection among them that they must always all emerge in
one and the same subject. Secondly, another feature common to these phenom­
ena is that they can arise both as a result of physical illness and also, in otherwise
healthy persons, in virtue of a certain particular disposition. In both cases these
phenomena are immediate natural states; it is only as such that we have so far
considered them. But they can also be evoked intentionally. When this happens
they constitute animal magnetism proper, with which we now have to concern
ourselves.
In the first place, as regards the name 'animal magnetism', it originally arose
from the fact that Mesmer began by using magnets to arouse the magnetic state.
This name was subsequently retained because in animal magnetism too, as in inor­
ganic magnetism, an immediate reciprocal relation of two existences occurs. In
addition, the state in question has here and there been called mesmerism, solar­
ism, and tellurism. However, the first of these three appellations tells us, for itself,
nothing about the phenomenon, and the other two relate to an entirely different
sphere from that of animal magnetism; the mental nature, to which animal mag­
netism lays claim, also contains within itself something entirely different from
merely solar and telluric moments, from these entirely abstract determinations
which we have already considered in §392 in the natural soul that has not yet
developed into an individual subject. 20
It was animal magnetism proper that first drew universal interest to magnetic
states, for it gave us the power to elicit and develop all possible forms of these
states. However, the phenomena intentionally produced in this way do not differ
from the states already discussed, occurring without the participation of animal

Subjective Mind

magnetism proper; this j ust posits what is otherwise present as an

immediate nat­

ural state.
1 . Now first of all, in order to comprehend the possibility of intentionally pro­
ducing the magnetic state, we need only recall what we have indicated as the
fundamental concept of this entire stage of the soul. The magnetic state is an ill­
ness; for if in general the essence of disease must be posited in the separation of a
particular system of the organism from the universal physiological life, and if, in
virtue of this

alienation

of a particular system from the universal life, the anim­

al organism exhibits its finitude, impotence and dependence on an alien power,
then this universal concept of disease determines itself more specifically in rela­

rupture
waking being, berween my natural vital­
ity with its feeling, and my mediated, intellectual consciousness, a rupture which,
since everyone includes these rwo sides in himself, is of course contained in poten­
tiality in even the healthiest people, but does not come into existence in all indi­
viduals, only in those who have a particular disposition to it, and it becomes an
tion to the

magnetic state

in the following way: in this peculiar illness a

occurs berween my soulfol being and my

illness only when it emerges from its potentiality into actuality. But if my soul­
ful life separates from my intellectual consciousness and takes over its business,
I forfeit my freedom rooted in intellectual consciousness, I lose the capacity to
shut myself off from an alien power, I become subservient to it. Now j ust as the

spontaneously arising magnetic state ends up as dependence on an alien power, so,
conversely, an external power can also form the starting-point and- by catching
hold of me at the separation, present in itselfwithin me, berween my feeling life
and my thinking consciousness- bring this rupture within me into existence, and
so the magnetic state can be produced artificially. However, as already indicated,
only those individuals, in whom a particular disposition to this state is already
present, can easily and regularly become epopts; whereas people who fall into
this state only from a particular illness are never perfect epopts. The alien power
that generates magnetic somnambulism in a subject is mainly

another subject;

there are, however, also medicines, especially henbane, also water or metal, able
to exercise this power. Consequently, the subject with a disposition to magnetic
somnambulism is able to put himself in that state by making himself dependent
on such inorganic or vegetable substances.* -Among the means for producing
the magnetic state, particular mention must be made of the

baquet. This consists

of a vessel with iron rods which are touched by the persons to be magnetized,
and forms the middle term berween the magnetizer and these persons. Whereas
in general metals serve to intensifY the magnetic state, glass and silk conversely
•
The shamam of the Mongols are already familiar with this; when they are going to prophesy
they put themselves in the magnetic state by certain drinks. This happens even now among the
Indians for the same purpose. Something similar probably took place with the oracle at Delphi
where the priestess, sitting on a tripod over a cave, fell imo an ecstasy, often gende but sometimes
very agitated, and in this state emitted more or less articulate sounds which were imerpreted by the
priests who lived in the imuition of the substantial conditions of the life of the Greek people. 22

produce an insulating effect. Incidentally, the power of the magnetizer acts not
only on people but also on animals, for example, on dogs, cats, and monkeys; for
it is quite universally the soulfol life, and only the soulfol life, that can be put into
the magnetic state, no matter whether that life belongs to a mind or not.21

2. As

regards,

secondly,

the

mode and manner of magnetising,

this varies. Usu­

ally the magnetizer works by contact. Just as in galvanism the metals act on each
other by immediate contact, so the magnetizer too acts immediately on the per­
son to be magnetized. However, the magnetizing subject, being a self-contained
subject capable of controlling his will, can only operate successfully on condition
that he has the uncompromising will to communicate his power to the subject
to be brought into the magnetic state, to put by the act of magnetizing the two
one sphere. 2 3

animal spheres here confronting each other, as it were, into

More exactly, the magnetizer operates mainly by stroking, though this need not
involve actual contact and can occur with the hand of the magnetizer remaining
about an inch away from the corporeal body of the magnetic person. The hand
is moved from the head towards the pit of the stomach and from there towards
the extremities; care must here be taken to avoid stroking backwards because this
very easily gives rise to cramp. Sometimes this hand-movement can be success­
ful when made at a greater distance from the body than that indicated, that is,
at a distance of several paces, particularly when rapport has already been estab­
lished; in which case the power of the magnetizer close by would often be too
great and would produce harmful effects. The magnetizer can tell whether he is
still effective at a definite distance by feeling a certain warmth in his hand. But
stroking at a greater or less distance is not necessary in every case; the magnetic
rapport can rather be induced merely by laying on the hand, especially on the
head, on the stomach or the pit of the stomach; often only a pressure of the hand
is needed for it. (That is why people have rightly related those miraculous cures,
which are said to have been accomplished at very different times by priests and
other individuals by laying on ofhands, to animal magnetism.) Occasionally even
a single glance and the magnetizer' s invitation to magnetic sleep is sufficient to
induce it. Indeed, faith and will alone are said sometimes to have produced this
effect at a great distance. In this magical relationship, the main point is that a
subject acts on an individual subordinate to him in freedom and independence of
will. Therefore, very powerful organizations exert over weak natures the greatest
power, a power often so irresistible that the latter can be put into a magnetic sleep
by the former whether they wish it or not. For this same reason, strong men are
particularly qualified to magnetize female persons.

third point to be discussed here concerns the effects produced by mag­

so thoroughly cleared up that the occurrence of essentially new phenomena here
is no longer to be expected. If one wishes to consider the phenomena of animal
magnetism in their naivete then one must mainly stick to the older magnetizers.

Subjective Mind

1 10

Among the French, men of the noblest sentiments and highest culture have
concerned themselves with animal magnetism and have studied it with an open
mind. Among these men, Lieutenant-General Puysegur especially deserves men­
tion. If the Germans often make fun of the faulty theories of the French, it can
be asserted, at least as regards animal magnetism, that the na1ve metaphysics
employed by the French in considering it is much more satisfactory than the not
uncommon dream-fantasies and the lame as well as distorted theorizing of Ger­
man scholars. A serviceable, superficial classification of the phenomena of animal
magnetism has been given by Kluge.

Van Ghert, a reliable man

rich in ideas and

well versed in recent philosophy, has described magnetic cures in the form of a
diary. Karl Schelling, a brother of the philosopher, has also published a pan of his
magnetic experiences. So much for the relevant literature of animal magnetism
and the scope of our knowledge of the subject. 24
After these preliminaries let us now turn to a brief consideration of the mag­
netic phenomena themselves. The proximate universal
the

sinking of the

effect of magnetizing

is

magnetic person into the state of his shrouded, undifferenti­

ated natural life, i.e., into sleep. The onset of sleep indicates the beginning of the
magnetic state. However, sleep is not entirely necessary; magnetic cures can be
carried out without it. What must necessarily take place here is only the sentient
soul's becoming independent, its separation from the mediated, intellectual con­
sciousness. The second point we have to consider here concerns the physiological
side or basis of the magnetic state. About this it must be said that in this state
the activity of the

outward directed organs

passes over to the

inner organs,

that

the activity exercised by the brain in the waking and intellectual consciousness
devolves upon the reproductive system during magnetic somnambulism, because
in this state consciousness is demoted to the simple, internally undifferentiated nat­
uralness ofsoul-life; bur this simple naturalness, this shrouded life, is contradicted
by the

sensibility directed outwards; whereas the inward turned reproductive sys­

tem, which is dominant in the simplest animal organisms and forms animality
in general, is absolutely inseparable from this shrouded soul-life. This then is the
reason why, during magnetic somnambulism, the soul's activity descends into the

brain of the reproductive system,

namely, into the ganglia, these variously nodu­

lated nerves in the abdomen. That this is the case, was sensed by

van Helmont

after he had rubbed himself with henbane ointment and taken the j uice of this
herb. According to his description he felt as if his thinking consciousness was
going from his head into his abdomen, especially into his stomach, and it seemed
to him that with this transference his thinking became more acute and was asso­
ciated with a particularly pleasant feeling. This concentration of the soul-life in
the abdomen is considered by a famous French magnetizer to depend on the fact
that during magnetic somnambulism the blood in the region of the pit of the
stomach remains very fluid, even when in the other parts it is extremely thick.
But the unusual arousal of the reproductive system occurring in the magnetic

Anthropology, The Soul
state is seen not only in the

ory

Ill

mental form of clairooyance but also in the more sens­

shape of the sex-drive awakening with greater or lesser vitality, especially in

female persons.25
After this mainly physiological consideration of animal magnetism we have to
determine more precisely the nature of this state with respect to the soul. As in the
spontaneously occurring magnetic states previously considered, so too, in inten­
tionally induced animal magnetism, the soul immersed in its inwardness intuits
its individual world not

outside itself, but within itself This

sinking of the soul

into its inwardness can, as already remarked, come to a halt half-way, so to speak;
then sleep does not occur. But the further stage is that life is completely cut off
from the outside by sleep. With this rupture, too, the course of the magnetic
phenomena

can

come to a standstill. But the transition from magnetic sleep to

clairooyance is equally possible.

Most magnetic persons will be in this clairvoyant

state without recalling it. The presence of clairvoyance has often been shown only
by chance; it mostly comes to light when the magnetic person is spoken to by the
magnetizer; if he had not spoken, the person would perhaps only have gone on
sleeping. Now though the answers of clairvoyants seem to come out of another
world, yet these individuals can be aware of what they, as objective conscious­
ness, are. Often, however, they speak of their intellectual consciousness too as if
it were another person. When clairvoyance develops more determinately, mag­
netic persons give accounts of their bodily state and of their mental interior. But
their sensations are as vague as the representations that the blind man, knowing
nothing about the difference between light and dark, has of external things. What
is seen in clairvoyance often only becomes clearer some days later, but is never
so plain that it does not need interpretation. Sometimes, however, the magnetic
person's own interpretation fails completely and, often, at least turns out to be
so symbolical and bizarre that it in its turn renders necessary a further interpret­
ation by the intellectual consciousness of the magnetizer, so that the final result
of the magnetic clairvoyance mostly consists of a varied mixture of falsehood and
correctness. Yet, on the other hand, it cannot be denied that clairvoyants some­
times give very determinate accounts of the nature and course of their illness,
that they usually know very accurately when their paroxysms will occur, when
and how long they need magnetic sleep, how long their treatment will last, and
that, finally, they sometimes discover a connection between a remedy and an
ailment to be removed by it, a connection perhaps still unknown to intellectu­
al consciousness, thus making easy a cure otherwise difficult for the doctor. In
this respect clairvoyants can be compared to animals, for they are instructed by
their instinct which things will cure them. But as regards the further content of
intentionally induced clairvoyance we need hardly remark that in this, as in nat­
ural clairvoyance, the soul is able to read and hear with the pit of the stomach.
Here we want to emphasize only two more points; first, that what lies outside
the context of the magnetic person's substantia/ life is not contacted through
the somnambulistic state, that consequently clairvoyance does not, for example,

1 12

Subjective Mind

extend to foreseeing the winning numbers in a lottery, and in general cannot be
used for selfish ends. Great world-events are by contrast in a different position
from such contingent things. For instance it is recorded that a somnambulist on
the eve of the battle at Belle-Alliance cried out in great exaltation: 'Tomorrow, he
who has done us so much harm will perish either by lightning or the sword.' The
second point still to be mentioned here is that since in clairvoyance the soul leads
a life cut o./Jfrom its intellectual consciousness, clairvoyants on awaking initially
no longer have any awareness of what they have seen in the magnetic somnambu­
lism, that they can however gain an awareness of it in aroundabout way, namely
by dreaming about what they saw and then recalling the dreams on waking. Also
partial recollection of what was seen can be deliberately produced, and, to be
more precise, in the following way: the doctor sets the sick during their waking
state the task of firmly resolving to retain what they have sensed in the magnetic
state.26
4. Fourthly, as regards the close connection and the dependence of the magnet­
ic person on the magnetizer, there remains to be added to what was said in the
Remark to §406 under 1\1\) with regard to the bodily side of this connection, that
the clairvoyant person can at first hear only the magnetizer, and he can hear oth­
er individuals only when they stand in rapport with the magnetizer, though at
times he loses hearing as well as sight entirely; further, in this exclusive connec­
tion of the life of the magnetic person with his magnetizer, being touched by a
third person can become extremely dangerous, producing convulsions and cata­
lepsy. - But with respect to the mental connection between the magnetizer and
the magnetic person, we may also mention that clairvoyants, if the magnetizer's
awareness becomes their own, often acquire the capacity to know something that
is not immediately seen by themselves internally. Thus they can, for example,
say what time it is without any direct sensation of their own, provided that the
magnetizer has certainty on this point. Knowledge of the intimate community
in question protects us from the folly of astonishment at the wisdom some­
times unearthed by clairvoyants; this wisdom very often properly belongs not to
the magnetic persons but to the individual in rapport with them. - Besides this
community of awareness the magnetic person can, particularly with the lengthy
continuation of clairvoyance, also enter into other mental relations with the mag­
netizer, into relations involving manner, passion, and character. In particular the
vanity of clairvoyants can be easily aroused if one makes the mistake of letting
them believe that one attaches great importance to their words. Somnambulists
are then overcome by a craze to speak about anything and everything, even if
they have no corresponding intuitions of them whatsoever. In this case, clair­
voyance is completely useless and, in fact, becomes something suspect. Therefore
the question has often been discussed among magnetizers whether clairvoyance
should be cultivated and preserved when it has arisen spontaneously, and, in the
converse case, intentionally induced, or whether, on the contrary, efforts should
be made to prevent it. As already mentioned, clairvoyance comes to light and

Anthropology, The Soul

1 13

to development as a result of repeated questioning of the magnetic person. Now
if the questioning concerns very diverse objects, the magnetic person can easily
become distracted, more or less lose the concentration on himself, and so become
less able to describe his illness and to indicate the remedy to be employed, thereby
considerably delaying the cure. For this reason the magnetizer must, in his ques­
tions, take the greatest care to avoid arousing the vanity and the distraction of
the magnetic person. But in particular the magnetizer must not let himself on
his part fall into a relationship of dependence on the magnetic person. This mis­
hap occurred more frequently earlier, when magnetizers drew more on their own
strength than since the time when they have used the baquet. With the use of this
instrument, the magnetizer is less entangled in the state of the magnetic person.
Even so, a great deal depends on the strength of the mind, the character and the
physical body of the magnetizers. If they give in to the whims of the magnetic
person, which is particularly the case with non-doctors, if they have not the cour­
age to contradict and stand up to him and in this way the magnetic person gets
the feeling of a strong influence on his part on the magnetizer, then like a spoilt
child he gives himself up to every whim, gets the strangest notions, and uncon­
sciously pulls the magnetizer's leg, thus hindering his own cure. - However, it
is not merely in this bad sense that the magnetic person can acquire a certain
independence; if he normally possesses an ethical character, he retains even in the
magnetic state a firmness of ethical feeling on which any impure intentions of the
magnetizer founder. For instance, a magnetized woman declared that she need
not obey the magnetizer' s request to undress in front of him.

5. The fifth and last point that we have to touch on in animal magnetism con­
cure. Undoubtedly many cures that

cerns the real aim of magnetic treatment,

happened in earlier times and were regarded as miracles must be viewed as noth­
ing other than effects of animal magnetism. But we do not need to appeal to
such stories of miracles wrapped in the obscurity of the distant past; for in recent
times men of unimpeachable integrity have performed so many cures by magnet­
ic treatment that anyone forming an unbiased j udgement can no longer doubt
the fact of the curative power of animal magnetism. Consequently, all that we
have to do now is to show the mode and manner in which magnetism effects a
cure. To this end we can recall that even the ordinary medical cure consists in
removing the interference with the identity of animal life that constitutes the dis­
ease, in restoring the fluid-being-within-itself of the organism. Now in magnetic
treatment this goal is achieved by producing either sleep and clairvoyance or just
a general immersion of the individual life within itself, its return to its simple uni­
versality. J ust as

natural sleep brings about

a strengthening of healthy life, since

it withdraws the entire man from the enfeebling fragmentation of activity direc­
ted towards the external world into the substantial totality and harmony of life,
so too, the

sleeping magnetic state,

since by it the internally disrupted organism

attains to unity with itself, is the basis of health to be restored. However, on the
other hand we must not leave out of consideration here the way in which this

1 14

Subjective Mind

concentration of sentient life present in the magnetic state can, in its turn, become
such a one-sided condition that it pathologically entrenches itself in opposition to
the rest oforganic lift and to normal comciousness. It is this possibility which raises
doubts about the intentional production of this concentration. If duplication of
the personality is carried too far, then one acts in a way that contradicts the pur­
pose, healing, since a separation is produced which is greater than that which
the magnetic treatment is meant to remove. In such careless treatment lurks the
danger that severe crises, frightful convulsions, will occur and that the opposi­
tion generating these phenomena will remain not merely corporeal but in various
ways become an opposition within the somnambulistic consciousness itself. If, by
contrast, one sets to work cautiously enough not to take too far the concentration
of sentient life occurring in the magnetic state, then in this concentration one
has, as already remarked, the foundation for a restoration of health, and one is
in a position to complete the cure by gradually guiding the rest of the organism,
which though still involved in separation is powerless against its concentrated life,
back into its substantial unity, into its simple harmony with itself, and thereby
to enable it, without detriment to its inner unity, to involve itself once more in
separation and opposition. 27

(�) Self-feeling
§407
( 1 ) The feeling totality, as individuality, is essentially this: distinguishing itself
within itself, and awakening to the judgement within itself, in virtue of which it
has particular feelings and stands as a subject in respect of these determinations of
itself. The subject as such posits them within itselfas its feelings. It is immersed in
this particularity of sensations, and at the same time, through the ideality of the
particular, in them it joins together with itself as a subjective unit. In this way it is
self-feeling, -and yet it is this only in the particularfeeling. 1

§408
(2) Owing to the immediacy in which self-feeling is still determined, i.e. owing
to the moment of bodiliness which in self-feeling is still undetached from the
mind, and since too the feeling itself is a particular feeling, thus a particular
embodiment, the subject, though educated to intellectual consciousness, is still
susceptible to the disease of remaining fast in a particularity of its self-feeling,
unable to refine it to ideality and overcome it. The fully furnished selfof intellec­
tual consciousness is the subject as an internally consistent consciousness, which
orders and conducts itself in accordance with its individual position and its con­
nection with the likewise internally ordered external world. But when it remains
ensnared in a particular determinacy, it fails to assign that content the intelligible
place and the subordinate position belonging to it in the individual world-system

Anthropology, The Soul

1 15

which a subject is. In this way the subject finds itself in the contradiction between
its totality systematized in its consciousness, and the particular determinacy in
that consciousness, which is not pliable and integrated into an overarching order.
This is derangement. I
[Remark] In considering derangement we must likewise anticipate the cultivated,
intellectual consciousness, the subject which is at the same time the natural self
of self-feeling. In this determination it is capable of falling into the contradiction
between its subjectivity, free for itself, and a particularity which does not become
ideal in subjectivity and remains fixed in self-feeling. Mind is free, and therefore
not susceptible for itself to this disease. But in earlier metaphysics it was regarded
as soul, as a thing, and only as a thing, i.e. as something natural and in being, is
it liable to derangement, to the finitude lodged in it. Derangement is therefore a
psychical disease, i.e. a disease of body and mind alike; the commencement may
seem to proceed from one more than the other, and so may the cure. 2
The sober and healthy subject has an alert consciousness of the ordered total­
ity of its individual world, into the system of which it subsumes each particular
content of sensation, idea, desire, inclination, etc., as it arises, and inserts in its
intelligible place in the system. It is the dominant genius over these particularit­
ies. The difference is like that between waking and dreaming, but here the dream
falls within waking life itself, so that it belongs to actual self-feeling. Error and
the like is a content consistently admitted into this objective interconnection. In
the concrete, however, it is often difficult to say where error begins to become
madness. Thus an intense passion of hatred, etc., based on trivial reasons, may,
in contrast to a presupposed higher self-possession and stability, seem like going
out of one's mind with madness. But madness essentially involves the contra­
diction in which a feeling that has come into being in a bodily form confronts
the totality of mediations that is the concrete consciousness. The mind that is
determined as merely being, in so far as such being is undissolved in its con­
sciousness, is diseased. -The content which is set free into its natural state is
the self-seeking determinations of the heart, vanity, pride, and the subject's other
passions and imaginings, hopes, love and hatred. This earthly throng gets free,
when self-possession and the universal, theoretical or moral principles, lose their
power over the natural forces that they usually suppress and keep concealed; for
this evil is implicitly present within the heart, because the heart, being imme­
diate, is natural and selfish. It is the evil genius of man that becomes dominant
in derangement, but in opposition and in contradiction to the better and more
intellectual side, which is also in man. Hence this state is a breakdown and dis­
tress within the mind itself. -The genuine psychical treatment therefore keeps
firmly in view the fact that derangement is not an abstract loss of reason, whether
in respect of intelligence or of the will and its responsibility, but only derange­
ment, only a contradiction within the reason that is still present, just as physical
disease is not an abstract, i.e. complete, loss of health (that would be death) , but a

1 16

Subjective Mind

contradiction within health. This humane treatment, i.e. a treatment that is both
benevolent and rational (the services of Pine! towards which deserve the highest
acknowledgement) , presupposes the patient's rationality, and makes that a firm
basis for dealing with him on his rational side, just as in the case of bodily disease
the doctor bases his treatment on the vitality which as such still contains health.3

Zusatz. What follows may serve to elucidate the above Paragraph:
Already in the Zusatz to §402, we interpreted derangement as the second of the
three developmental stages passed through by the feeling soul in its struggle with
the immediacy of its substantial content in order to rise to the simple subjectivity,
relating itselfto itself, present in the /, and thereby become completely conscious
and in control of itself This conception of derangement as a necessarily emerging
form or stage in the development of the soul is naturally not to be understood
as if we were asserting that every mind, every soul, must go through this stage
of extreme disruption. Such an assertion would be as absurd as to assume that
because crime is considered in the Philosophy ofRight as a necessary appearance
of the human will, therefore the commission of crime is supposed to be made
an inevitable necessity for every individual. Crime and derangement are extremes
which the human mind in general has to overcome in the course of its develop­
ment, but which do not appear as extremes in every individual but only in the
shape of limitations, errors, follies, and of non-criminal wrongdoing. This is suf­
ficient to justifY our consideration of derangement as an essential stage in the
development of the soul.4
But as regards the determination of the concept of derangement, we have
already indicated in the Zusatz to §405 the peculiarity of this state- in contrast
to magnetic somnambulism, the first of the three stages in the development of the
feeling soul we considered- to the effect that in derangement the relationship
of the soulfUl to objective consciousness is no longer one of mere difference, but
of direct opposition, and therefore the soulful no longer mixes with objective
consciousness. We will demonstrate here the truth of this statement by a further
discussion and thereby also prove the rational necessity of the progression of our
exposition from magnetic states to derangement. The necessity of this progression
lies in the fact that the soul is already in itself the contradiction of being an
individual, a single entity, and yet at the same time immediately identical with
the universal natural soul, with its substance. This opposition existing in the
contradictory form of identity, must be posited as opposition, as contradiction. This
first happens in derangement; for in derangement the subjectivity of the soul first
separates from its substance, which in somnambulism is still immediately identical
with it, and not only that: it comes into direct opposition to it, into complete
contradiction with the objective, thereby becoming a purelyformal, empty, abstract
subjectivity, and in this its one-sidedness claims for itself the significance of a
veritable unity of the subjective and objective. Therefore, the unity and separation,
present in derangement, of the opposed sides just mentioned is still an imperfect

Anthropology, The Soul

1 17

unity. This unity and this separation only reach their perfect shape in rational,
in actually objective consciousness. When I have risen to rational thinking I am
not only for myself, an object to myself, and therefore a subjective identity of the
subjective and objective, but I have, secondly, disconnected this identity from
myself, placed it over against myself as an actually objective identity. In order to
achieve this complete separation, the feeling soul must overcome its immediacy,
its naturalness, bodiliness, must posit them ideally, make them its own, thereby
transforming them into an objective unity of the subjective and objective and thus
discharging its Other from its immediate identity with the feeling soul as well as
at the same time freeing itself from this Other. But the soul has not yet reached
this goal at the standpoint at which we are now considering it. In so far as it is
deranged, it clings to a merely subjective identity of the subjective and objective,
rather than to an objective unity of these two sides; and only in so far as, with all
its folly and all its madness, it is still at the same time rational and stands therefore
on another level than the one now to be considered, does the soul attain to an
objective unity of the subjective and objective. For in the state of derangement
proper both modes of finite mind -on the one hand rational consciousness
developed within itself, with its objective world, on the other hand inner sensation
clinging to itself and having its objectivity within itself-are cultivated, each
for itself, into the totality, into a personality. The objective consciousness of the
deranged shows itself in the most diverse ways: they are aware, e.g., that they
are in a lunatic asylum; they know their attendants; are also aware with regard
to others that they are fools; make fun of each other's folly; are employed on all
kinds of tasks, sometimes even appointed overseers. But at the same time they
are dreaming while awake and are captivated by a particular idea that cannot be
unified with their objective consciousness. This waking dreaming of theirs has an
affinity with somnambulism; but the two states are also distinct from each other.
In somnambulism the two personalities present in one individual make no contact
with each other, the somnambulistic consciousness, on the contrary, is so separated
from the waking consciousness that neither of them is aware of the other, and
the duality ofpersonalities also appears as a duality ofstates. In derangementproper,
by contrast, the two different personalities are not two different states but are in
one and the same state; so that these reciprocally negative personalities-soulful
consciousness and intellectual consciousness-have mutual contact and are aware
ofeach other. The deranged subject is therefore together with itselfin the negative
ofitself, i.e., in its consciousness the negative of that consciousness is immediately
present. This negative is not overcome by the deranged individual, the duality
into which he splits up is not brought to unity. Consequently, though the
deranged individual is in himselfone and the same subject, yet, as an object for
himself, he is not an internally undivided subject, concordant with itself, but a
subject diverging into two differentpersonalities.s
The determinate sense of this disruption, of this being-together-with-itselfof the
mind in the negative of itself, needs still further development. In derangement

1 18

Subjective Mind

this negative acquires a more concrete meaning than the negative of the soul has
had in our exposition so far, just as the mind's being-together-with-itself must be
taken here in a more replete sense than the being-for-itself of the soul that has so
far been achieved.6
In the first place, therefore, we must distinguish this negative characteristic of
derangement from other sorts of negative of the soul. To this end we can note
that when we endure, e.g., hardships we are also together with ourselves in a neg­
ative, but we need not therefore be fools. We become fools only if we endure
hardships when we have no rational aim to be attained only in this way. A jour­
ney, e.g. , to the Holy Sepulchre undertaken for the purpose of fortifYing one's
soul may be regarded as a madness, because such a journey is quite useless for
the end in view and is therefore not a necessary means for procuring it. For
the same reason, the journeys across whole countries made by Indians crawling
on their stomachs can be pronounced a derangement. The negative endured in
derangement is, therefore, one in which only the sentient consciousness, not the
intellectual and rational consciousness, finds itself again. 7
But in the deranged state the negative constitutes, as we have just said, a
determination which befalls both the soulfol consciousness and the intellectual
consciousness in their mutual relation. This relation of these two opposed
modes of the mind's being-together-with-itself likewise needs a more precise
characterization to prevent its being confused with the relationship in which mere
error andfolly stand to the okjective, rational consciousness. 8
To clarifY this point, let us recall that when the soul becomes consciousness,
there arises for it, by the separation of what in the natural soul is unified in
an immediate way, the opposition of a subjective thinking and externality, - two
worlds which are in truth identical with one another ('ordo rerum atque idear­
um idem est', says Spinoza) , but which to the merely reflective consciousness,
to finite thinking, appear as essentially diffirent and independent of one another.
Consequently, the soul, as consciousness, enters the sphere ofjinitude and contin­
gency, of the self-external, hence individualized. What I am aware of at this level,
I am aware of initially as something individualized, unmediated, consequently as
something contingent, as something given, found. What is found and sensed, I
transform into representations, at the same time making it into an external object.
But at the same time I then recognize this content, in so far as the activity of my
intellect and reason are directed on it, as not merely individualized and contingent
but a moment of a great interconnection, as standing in infinite mediation with
other contents, and by this mediation becoming something necessary. Only if I
proceed in the way just indicated am I using my intellect, while the content with
which I am filled gains on its part the form of objectivity. Just as this objectivity
is the goal of my theoretical striving, it also forms the norm of my practical con­
duct. If, therefore, I want to transfer my aims and interests, thus representations
proceeding from me, out of their subjectivity into objectivity, then I must, if I am
to apply my intellect, represent to myself the material, the reality confronting me

Anthropokgy, The Soul

1 19

in which I intend to actualize this content, in the way that it is in truth. But
j ust as I must have a correct representation of the objectivity confronting me if l
am to behave intelligently, so too must I have a correct representation of myself,
i.e., a representation that harmonizes with the

totality of my actuality,

with my

infinitely determined individuality as distinct from my substantial being. 9
Now, of course, I can be
myself.

Unintelligent people

mistaken, both about the external world and about
have empty, subjective representations, unrealizable

wishes, which all the same they hope to actualize in the future. They confine
themselves to entirely individualized aims and interests, cling to one-sided prin­

conflict with actuality. But this narrow-mindedness
mistakes are still not in the least deranged if the unintelligent are at the
same time aware that their subjectivity does notyet exist objectively. Error and folly
only become derangement in the case where someone believes he has his merely
subjective representation objectively present to him and clings to it in face of the
actual objectivity standing in contradiction with it. To the deranged, their mere

it. Therefore

when someone's speaks in a deranged way, the first thing is always to remind
him of the whole range ofhis circumstances, of his concrete actuality. Then if he
nevertheless sticks to his false representation, even though that objective inter­
connection has been presented to his representation and he has been made aware
of it, the derangement of such a person is not open to any doubt. 1 0

deranged representation can
empty abstraction and mere possibility regarded by the deranged as
something concrete and actual; for as we have seen, this representation precisely
involves abstraction from the concrete actuality of the deranged. If, e.g., I, who am

king. I I
But the reason why such a fixation on a particular representation, irreconcil­

can arise in me lies in the fact that I am initially a
wholly abstract, completely indeterminate I , an I thus standing open to any content
whatever. In so far as I am such an I, I can frame for myself the emptiest represent­

able with my concrete actuality,

ations, take myself, e.g. , to be a dog (in fairy-tales men have indeed been turned
into dogs) , or imagine that I am able to fly, because there is enough room to do
this and other living creatures are able to fly. As soon as I become a

concrete I,
determinate thoughts of actuality, as soon as, e.g. , in the
last-mentioned case I think of my heaviness, then I see the impossibility of my fly­
ing. Only man gets as far as grasping himself in this complete abstraction ofthe I.
This is why he has, so to speak, the privilege of folly and madness. But this illness

by contrast, and acquire

1 20

Subjective Mind

only develops in the concrete, sober self-consciousness in so far as this descends to
the impotent, passive, abstract I of which we have just spoken. By this descent the
concrete I loses its absolute power over the entire system of its determinations,
forfeits the ability to put everything coming to the soul in the right place, to
remain perfectly present to itselfin each of its representations; and by letting itself
be captivated by a particular, merely subjective representation, is driven out of
its wits, is shifted out from the centre of its actuality and, since it also still retains
a consciousness of its actuality, acquires two centres, one in the remnants of its
intellectual consciousness, the other in its deranged representation. 12
In the deranged consciousness the abstract universality of the immediate I, the I
that just is, stands in unresolved contradiction with a representation torn off from
the totality of actuality, and consequently individualized. This consciousness is,
therefore, not genuine being-together-with-itself but being-together-with-itself
stuck fast in the negative of the I. An equally unresolved contradiction prevails
here between, on the one hand, this individualized representation and the
abstract universality of the I and, on the other hand, the internally harmonious
total actuality. It is clear from this that the proposition, 'What I think is true',
which is rightly defended by conceptual reason, acquires in the deranged a deranged
sense and becomes something just as untrue as the assertion pitted against that
proposition by the unintelligence of the intellect, the assertion of the absolute
divorce between the subjective and objective. Over this unintelligence, as well as
over derangement, even the mere sensation of the healthy soul has the advantage
of rationality, in so far as the actual unity of the subjective and objective is
present in it. As we have already said above, however, this unity only acquires
its perfect form in conceptual reason; for only what is thought by conceptual
reason is something true in regard both to its form and its content, -a perfect
unity of what is thought and what is. In derangement, by contrast, the unity and
the difference of the subjective and objective are still something merely fonnal,
excluding the concrete content of actuality. 1 3
Because o f the context and also for even greater clarification, we want at this
point to repeat in a more condensed and, if possible, more determinate form,
something which has already been touched on several times in the above Para­
graph and in the Remark to it. We mean the point that derangement must be
conceived essentially as an illness at once mental and bodily, and for this reas­
on: the unity of the subjective and objective prevailing in derangement is still
wholly immediate and has not yet gone through infinite mediation, the I affected
by derangement, no matter how acute this tip of self-feeling may be, is still nat­
ural, immediate, a being, and consequently what is distinct from it can take root
in it as a being; or, still more determinately, in derangement a particular feeling
contradicting the objective consciousness of the deranged is heldfast as something
objective in the face of that consciousness, is not posited ideally, this feeling con­
sequently having the form of a being, hence of a bodily entity, and in this way a
duality of being emerges in the deranged which is not overcome by his objective

Anthropology, The Soul

121

consciousness, a divergence which just is and which becomes for the deranged
soul a fixed barrier. I4
Further, as regards the other question which likewise has already been raised
in the above Paragraph, 'How does mind come to be deranged?', we may supple­
ment the answer given there by remarking that this question already presupposes
the firm, objective consciousness not yet attained by the soul at its present stage
of development; and that, at the point we have now reached in our inquiry, it is
rather the converse question that should be answered, namely the question: 'How
does the soul that is enclosed in its inwardness and is immediately identical with its
individual world, emerge from the merelyformal, empty difference of the subject­
ive and objective and attain to the actual difference of these two sides, and thus
to the genuinely objective, intellectual and rational consciousness?' The answer to
this will be given in the last four Paragraphs of the first part of the theory of
subjective mind. I 5
From what was said at the beginning o f this Anthropology about the necessity
of starting the philosophical consideration of subjective mind with the natural
mind, and from the concept ofderangement developed above in all its aspects, it
will incidentally be sufficiently clear why derangement must be dealt with before
the healthy, intellectual consciousness, although it has the intellect for its pre­
supposition and is nothing other than the extremity ofthe diseased condition into
which the intellect can descend. We had to settle the discussion of this condition
already in Anthropology because in derangement the soulful, the natural self, the
abstract, formal subjectivity, gains the upper hand over the objective, rational, con­
crete consciousness, and consideration of the abstract, natural self must precede the
exposition of concrete, free mind. However, in order that this progression from
something abstract to the concrete that contains it in potentiality may not have
the look of an isolated and therefore suspect phenomenon, we can recall that in
the Philosophy ofRight a similar progression has to take place. In this science too,
we begin with something abstract, namely with the concept of the will; we then
proceed to the ensuing actualization of the still abstract will in an external reality,
to the sphere offormal right; from there we go on to the will reflected into itselfour
of external reality, to the realm of morality, and thirdly and lastly we come to the
will that unites within itself these two abstract moments and is therefore concrete,
ethical will. In the sphere of ethics itself we then begin again from an immediacy,
from the natural undeveloped shape that the ethical mind has in the family; then
we come to the rupture of the ethical substance in civil society; and finally we reach
the unity and truth, present in the political state, of those two one-sided forms of
the ethical mind. However, from this course taken by our inquiry it does not fol­
low in the least that we wanted to make ethical life something later in time than
right and morality, or to explain the family and civil society as something preced­
ing the state in actuality. We are well aware that ethical life is the foundation of
right and morality, as also that the family and civil society with their well-ordered
differentiations already presuppose the presence of the state. In the philosophical

1 22

Subjective Mind

development of the ethical, however, we cannot begin with the state, since in the
state the ethical has unfolded into its most concrete form, whereas the beginning is
necessarily something abstract. For this reason too morality must be considered
before ethics, although morality in a way emerges in ethics only as a sickness. And
for the same reason too we have had, in the realm of Anthropology, to discuss
derangement before the concrete, objective consciousness, since derangement, as
we have seen, consists in an abstraction held on to in opposition to the concrete
objective consciousness of the deranged. 1 6 -This concludes the remarks we had
to make here about the concept of derangement in general.
As regards the particular varieties of the deranged condition, people usually
differentiate them not so much by an inner determinacy as by the outward expres­
sions of this illness. This is not adequate for philosophical inquiry. We have to
recognize even derangement as something differentiated within itse/f in a neces­
sary and in that respect rational manner. But a necessary differentiation of this
condition of the soul cannot be derived from the particular content of the formal
unity of the subjective and objective present in derangement; for this content is
something infinitely manifold and therefore contingent. On the contrary, there­
fore, we must keep our eye on the entirely universal differences ofform emerging
in derangement. For this purpose we must refer back to our previous descrip­
tion of derangement as a closure ofthe mind, as a submergence within itself, whose
peculiarity, in contrast to the being-within-itself of mind present in somnambu­
lism, consists in its being no longer in immediate connection with actuality but in
having decidedly cut itself ojffrom it. 17
Now this submergence within itself is, on the one hand, the universal in every
variety of derangement; on the other hand, when it remains in its indeterminacy,
in its emptiness, it forms a particular variety of the deranged state. It is with this
that we have to begin our consideration of the various kinds of derangement. I S
But i f this quite indeterminate being-within-itself acquires a determinate con­
tent, binds itself to a merely subjective, particular representation and takes this to
be something objective, then we see the second form of derangement. 19
The third and last main form of this illness emerges when that which con­
fronts the soul's delusion is likewise for the soul, when the deranged compares his
merely subjective representation with his objective consciousness, discovers the
acute opposition obtaining between the two, and thus arrives at the unhappy feel­
ing of his contradiction with himself. Here we see the soul in the more or less
despairing endeavour to escape from the discord, already present in the second
form of derangement but there felt only slightly or not at all, and to regain con­
crete identity with itself, the inner harmony of the self-consciousness persisting
impenurbably in the one centre of its actuality. 20
Let us now consider in somewhat more detail these three main forms of
derangement.
<l<l) Imbecility, absent-mindedness, rambling. The first of these three main
forms, the quite indeterminate submergence in oneself, appears at first as

Anthropology, The Soul

123

imbecility. This takes different forms. There is natural imbecility. This is
incurable. Particularly what is called cretinism belongs here, a state that is partly
sporadic in its occurrence and partly endemic in certain regions, especially in
narrow valleys and marshy places. Cretins are misshapen, deformed people, often
afflicted with goitre; conspicuous by a completely stupid facial expression; their
undeveloped soul often cannot go beyond entirely inarticulate sounds. - But
besides this natural imbecility we also find an imbecility into which someone
descends by undeserved misfortune or by his own fault. With regard to the
former case, Pine/ cites the example of a congenital imbecile whose dull­
wittedness was believed to be the result of an extremely severe fright which
her mother had had when she was pregnant with her. Imbecility is often a
consequence offrenzy, in which case cure becomes highly improbable; epilepsy,
too, often terminates in the state of imbecility. But the same state is no less
frequently brought on by excess of dissipation. -With regard to the appearance
of imbecility we can also mention that it occasionally reveals itself as catalepsy,
as a complete paralysis of both corporeal and mental activity. -lncidentally,
imbecility occurs not merely as a permanent state, but also as a transitory state.
An Englishman, e.g., sank into indifference to all things, first to politics and then
to his own affairs and to his family. He would sit quietly, looking straight in
front of him and for years did not speak a word, and showed an insensitivity that
made it doubtful whether he knew his wife and children or not. He was cured
when someone else, dressed exactly like him, sat opposite him and imitated him
in everything he did. This threw the patient into a violent frenzy which forced
him to attend to things outside of him and drove him permanently out of his
self-absorption.2I
A further modification of the first main form of the deranged state under dis­
cussion is absent-mindedness. This consists in a non-awareness of the immediate
present. This non-awareness often forms the beginning of madness; yet there is
also a lofty absent-mindedness far removed from madness. This can occur when
the mind is withdrawn by profound meditations from attention to everything
relatively unimportant. Thus Archimedes was once so absorbed in a geometrical
problem that for several days he seemed to have forgotten all other things and
had to be wrenched by force out of this concentration of his mind on a single
point. But absent-mindedness proper is a submergence into entirely abstract self
fieling, into a suspension of sober, objective consciousness, into an unaware non­
presence of the mind at things at which it should be present. The subject in
this state confuses his true situation in the individual case with a false one, and
conceives outer circumstances in a one-sided manner, not in the totality of their
relations. Among many other examples, a delightful example of this state of soul
is a French count who, when his wig got caught on a chandelier, laughed heart­
ily over it with the others present and looked around to discover whose wig had
been pulled off, who was left with a bald pate. Another instance of this kind is
supplied by Newton. This scholar is supposed once to have taken hold of a lady's

1 24

Subjective Mind

finger in order to use it as a tobacco-stopper for his pipe. Such absent-mindedness
be the result of excessive study; it is found quite often in scholars, especially
in those of an earlier time. However, absent-mindedness often arises also, when
people want to be held in high esteem everywhere, and consequently keep their
subjectivity in view constantly, which makes them forget objectivity.22
Absent-mindedness stands in contrast to the rambling that takes an interest in
everything. Rambling springs from inability to fix attention on anything determ­
inate, and consists in the illness of stumbling from one object to another. This
ailment is mostly incurable. Fools of this kind are the most troublesome. Pine/
tells of such a subject who was a perfect image of chaos. He says: This sub­
ject approaches me and overwhelms me with his chatter. Straight afterwards he
does the same to someone else. When this individual comes into a room he
turns everything in it upside down, shakes chairs and tables and moves them
about without any apparent particular purpose. You only have to take your eyes
off him for a second and this subject is already out on the adjoining promen­
ade, busying himself there just as aimlessly as in the room, chattering, throwing
stones, pulling off foliage, going on further, turning round again, without know­
ing why. '- Rambling always stems from a weakness of the power of intellectual
consciousness to hold together the entirety of its representations. But ramblers
often already suffer from delirium- therefore, not merely from non-awareness of
what is immediately present but from an unconscious reversal of it. So much for
the first main form of the deranged state. 23
��) The second main form of it, madness proper, arises when the closure-within­
itself of the natural mind, whose various modifications we considered above,
acquires a determinate content and this content becomes a fixed idea, because
the mind not yet in complete control of itself becomes just as absorbed in it
as, in imbecility, it is absorbed in its own self, in the abyss of its indeterminacy.
It is hard to say with precision where madness proper begins. For example, in
small towns one finds people, especially women, who are so absorbed in an
extremely limited circle of particular interests and who feel so comfortable in
this parochialism of theirs that we rightly call such individuals crazy people. But
madness in the narrower sense of the word implies that the mind sticks fast in an
individual, merely subjective representation and regards it as something objective.
This state of soul mostly comes about when someone shuts himself up in his
subjectivity out of dissatisfaction with actuality. The passion of vanity and pride
is the chief cause of this self-cocooning of the soul within itself. Then the mind
thus nestled in its inwardness easily loses its understanding of actuality and finds
its way around only in its subjective representations. This conduct can soon
give rise to complete madness. For if there is still any vitality present in it, this
eremitic consciousness easily takes the step of creating some content or other
from its own resources and regarding this purely subjective item as something
objective and fixing it in place. That is, whereas, as we have seen, in imbecility
and in rambling as well, the soul does not possess the power to hold on to
can

Anthropology, The Soul

125

anything determinate, madness proper b y contrast displays this ability and by
this vety fact demonstrates that it is still consciousness, that in madness, therefore,
a differentiation of the soul from its firmly entrenched content still takes place.
Therefore, although on the one hand the madman's consciousness has coalesced
with that content, yet, on the other hand, in virtue of its universal nature
consciousness transcends the particular content of the deranged representation.
Therefore the mad have, alongside their craziness in relation to one point, at the
same time a good, coherent consciousness, a correct conception of things and
the capacity for intelligent action. This, in addition to the mistrustful reserve of
the mad, makes it possible that sometimes a madman is not at once recognized
as such and, in particular, that there are doubts about whether the cure of the
madness has succeeded, hence about whether the discharge of the mental patient
can take place.z4
The differences between the mad are mainly determined by the variety of the
representations that become entrenched in them.
Weariness with life can be reckoned as the most indeterminate madness when
it is not occasioned by the loss of loved and worthy persons and of ethical rela­
tionships. An indeterminate, groundless disgust with life is not indifference to it,
for in indifference life is endured; rather it is the inability to endure it, a fluctu­
ation to and fro between inclination and aversion towards everything pertaining
to actuality, a captivation by the fixed idea of the loathsomeness of life and at the
same time a striving to overcome this idea. It is mostly the English who succumb
to this disgust with actuality, arising without any rational ground, as well as to
other modes of madness; perhaps because with this nation induration into sub­
jective particularity is so prevalent. In the English, this weariness with life appears
mainly as melancholy, the mind's constant brooding over its unhappy representa­
tion, never rising to the vitality of thought and action. Not infrequently this state
of soul gives rise to an irrepressible impulse to suicide; on occasions this impulse
could only be eradicated by violently wrenching the despairing individual out of
himself. For instance, the stoty is told of an Englishman who was on the point of
drowning himself in the Thames when he was attacked by robbers; he offered the
fiercest resistance and by the suddenly awakening feeling of the value of life, he
lost all suicidal thoughts. Another Englishman who had hanged himself, on being
cut down by his servant not only regained the desire to live but also the disease of
avarice; for when discharging the servant, he deducted twopence from his wages
because the man had acted without instructions in cutting the rope in question.25
In contrast to the indeterminate form of deranged soul-state just described,
killing off all vitality, stands an endless throng, coupled with lively interests and
even with passion, of madnesses having an individualized content. This content
depends in part on the particular passion from which the madness sprang; but
it can also be determined contingently by something else. The first case will
have to be assumed with those madmen who, for example, have taken them­
selves to be God, or Christ, or a king. The second case, by contrast, will occur

1 26

Subjective Mind

when, for example, madmen suppose themselves to be a barleycom, or a dog, or
to have a carriage in their body. But in both cases the madman as such has no
determinate conscioumess of the contradiction obtaining between his fixed idea
and objectivity. Only we are aware of this contradiction; such a madman himself
is not tormented by the feeling of his inner disruption.
yy) Only when the third main form of the deranged state is present, mania or
insanity, do we have the phenomenon that the deranged subject himselfis aware
of being torn apart into two mutually contradictory modes of consciousness, that
the mental patient himselfhas a vivid feeling of the contradiction between his
merely subjective representation and objectivity, and yet cannot give up this rep­
resentation but insists on making it an actuality or annihilating what is actual. It
is implied in the concept of mania just indicated that it need not spring from an
empty illusion, but can be brought about particularly by a stroke of great misfor­
tune, by a derangement of someone's individual world, or by the violent upheaval
and coming out-of-joint of the universal state of the world if the individual lives
with his heart exclusively in the past and thus becomes unable to reconcile himself
to the present by which he feels himself at once rejected and bound. In the French
revolution, for example, many people became insane by the collapse of almost all
civic relationships. The same effect is often produced by religious causes in the
most frightful manner, when the individual is plunged into absolute uncertainty
whether he has been accepted by God into grace.
But in the insane the feeling of their inner disruption may be a tranquil pain,
but equally it can also advance to a rage ofreason against unreason and of unreas­
on against reason, and thus become fren:q. For this unhappy feeling is very easily
accompanied in the insane not only by a hypochondriacal mood tormented by
fancies and whims, but also by a suspicious, false, jealous, mischievous, and mali­
cious disposition, a fory over its hindrance by the surrounding actuality, over
those from whom it suffers a limitation of its will; just as, conversely, in spoilt
people, individuals who are accustomed to getting their own way in everything,
their rambling obstinacy easily turns to insanity when the rational will that wills
the universal erects against them a dam, which their rearing subjectivity is unable
to jump over or to break through. Traces of malice occur in everyone; however,
ethical or at least prudent people know how to suppress them. But in insanity,
where a particular representation usurps power over the rational mind, then in
general the particularity of the subject emerges without restraint, and so then the
impulses belonging to this particularity, natural impulses and those developed by
reflection, throw off the yoke of the ethical laws rooted in the genuinely univer­
salwill, -then consequently the dark, subterranean powers of the heart get free.
The fury of the insane often becomes a positive mania for injuring others, in
fact even a suddenly awakening desire to kill, which with irresistible force com­
pels those in its grip, despite the abhorrence of murder perhaps present in them,
to kill even those whom otherwise they love tenderly. As we have just indicated,
however, the malice of the insane does not exclude moral and ethical feelings;

Anthropology, The Soul

127

on the contrary, just because of the distress of the insane, because of the unmedi­
ated opposition dominant in them, these feelings can have an increased intensity.
Pine/ expressly says that nowhere has he seen more affectionate spouses and fath­
ers than in the lunatic asylum. 26
As regards the physical side of insanity, its appearance often shows a connection
with general changes in nature, especially with the course of the sun. Very hot
and very cold seasons exert particular influence in this regard. It has also been
noticed that the approach of storms and great changes in the weather produce
temporary disturbances and outbursts of the insane. With regard to phases of life,
it has been observed that insanity does not usually occur before the fifteenth year.
As for other corporeal differences, we are aware that in strong muscular people
with black hair, fits of rage are usually more violent than in blond persons. But
to what extent derangement is connected with an unhealthy nervous system, is a
point which eludes the eye of the doctor considering it from outside, as well as
that of the anatomist.
The cure ofderangement. The last point we have to discuss in connection with
insanity and derangement relates to the course of treatment to be applied to
both diseased states. The treatment is partly physical and partly psychological. At
times the former by itself alone is sufficient; mostly however it is necessary to
supplement this by psychological treatment which, likewise, can sometimes be
sufficient by itself alone. No universally applicable prescription for the physical
side of cure can be indicated. The medical remedies employed are, on the con­
trary, very much an empirical matter and therefore unreliable. But this much is
certain, that the worst procedure of all is the one formerly practised at Bedlam
which was limited to a thorough purging of the insane every three months. Some­
times, incidentally, the mentally ill have been cured in a physical way by the very
thing that is liable to cause derangement in those not afflicted, namely, by falling
heavily on their heads. The celebrated Montfoucon, e.g., is supposed to have been
freed of his listlessness in this way in his youth.
But psychological treatment always remains the main thing. While this can have
no effect on imbecility, it can often be successful in the treatment of madness
proper and insanity because in these soul-states a vitality of consciousness is still
present, and alongside derangement related to a particular representation, in its
other representations a rational consciousness still subsists, which a skillful psychi­
atrist can develop into a power over that particularity. (It is the merit of Pine/ in
particular to have conceived this residue of rationality present in the mad and the
insane as the foundation of cure and to have conducted his treatment of the men­
tally ill in accordance with this conception. His publication on this subject must
be declared the best that exists in this field.)
In the psychological course of treatment, what matters above all things is
to gain the confidence of the mad. This can be won because the deranged are
still ethical beings. But the surest way to get possession of their confidence
is to observe an open demeanour towards them without however letting this

1 28

openness degenerate into a direct attack on the deranged representation. Pine!
relates an example of this method of treatment and its successful outcome. A
hitherto amiable man became deranged, and since he did crazy stuff, possibly
harmful to others, he had to be locked up. This put him in a rage and he was
therefore tied up, but then fell into a higher degree of fury. He was therefore
taken to a lunatic asylum. Here the warden entered into a calm conversation
with the new arrival and gave in to his perverse utterances and thus calmed
him down. He then ordered his bonds to be untied, led him into his new
apartment and by continuing this procedure cured this mental patient in next
to no time. -After winning the confidence of the insane, one must try to gain
a j ust authority over them and to awaken in them the feeling that there is, in
general, something of importance and worth. The deranged feel their mental
weakness, their dependence on rational people. This makes it possible for the
latter to win their respect. In learning to respect the one who is treating him,
the deranged individual acquires the capacity to apply force to his subj ectivity
standing in contradiction with obj ectivity. So long as he is unable to do this
himself others have to exert force against him. Therefore if, for example, someone
deranged refuses to eat anything, or if he even destroys things around him, then
it goes without saying that such things cannot be tolerated. It is particularly
necessary-and this is often very difficult in the case of persons of rank, such
as George Ill- to humble the self-conceit of the arrogant insane by making them
feel their dependence. Of this case and the procedure to be observed here the
following noteworthy example is found in Pinel. Someone who took himself to
be Mahomet arrived at the lunatic asylum proud and self-important, demanded
homage, issued daily a mass of banishment- and death-sentences and raved in
royal fashion. Now although his delusion was not contradicted, he was forbidden
to give way to raving as this was unseemly, and when he did not obey they locked
him up and made representations to him about his conduct. He promised to
improve, was discharged, but again flew into a maniacal rage. Now they took this
Mahomet forcibly in hand, locked him up once more, and announced to him
that he must no longer hope for mercy. However, the warden's wife by an agreed
arrangement let herself be moved by his earnest entreaties for liberty and asked
him to promise faithfully not to abuse his freedom with outbursts of rage because
by this he would get her into trouble. She released him after he had made that
promise. From this moment on he behaved well. If he still got an attack of rage,
a glance from the warden's wife was enough to send him to his room to hide his
rage there. The respect he had for this woman and his will to conquer his fits of
rage restored him to sanity in six months.
As happened in the case j ust cited, we must always remember that, for all the
severity that occasionally becomes necessary towards the deranged, in general they
deserve considerate treatment owing to their rationality which is not yet entirely
destroyed. For this reason, the force to be applied to these unfortunates should
always be of such a kind as to have the moral significance of a just punishment.

Lunatics still have a feeling of what is right and good; they are aware, e.g., that
one should not harm others. Consequently the wrong they have committed can
be represented to them, imputed to them and punished in them, and the justice
of the punishment imposed made comprehensible to them. Thereby their better
self is encouraged and when this happens they gain confidence in their own eth­
ical power . Having reached this point, they become capable of fully recuperating
by associating with good people. On the other hand, the moral self-feeling of the
deranged can easily be so severely wounded by harsh, arrogant, contemptuous
treatment that they fly into the most furious rage and frenzy. Also one should not
be so imprudent as to let anything come close to the deranged, especially religious
maniacs, which could serve to strengthen their craziness. On the contrary, one
should endeavour to turn the deranged to other thoughts and so make them for­
get their fancies. A panicularly effective way of dispelling the fixed representation
is to compel the mad to occupy themselves mentally and especially physically;
by work they are forced out of their diseased subjectivity and impelled towards
the actual. Thus the case occurred of a tenant in Scotland who became noted for
curing the insane, although his procedure consisted simply and solely in harness­
ing them, half a dozen at a time, to a plough and making them work until they
were completely tired out. Of the remedies acting initially on the body, the swing
especially has proved efficacious with the deranged, especially with raving lunat­
ics. The seesaw movement on the swing makes the lunatic giddy and unsettles his
fixed representation. But a great deal can also be achieved for the recovery of the
deranged by sudden and powerful action on their fixed representation. It is true
that the mad are extremely distrustful when they notice people trying to wean
them away from their fixed representation. Yet at the same time they are stupid
and are easily taken by surprise. They can therefore often be cured by someone
pretending to enter into their delusion and then suddenly doing something in
which the deranged individual glimpses a liberation from his imagined ailment.
There is a well-known case of a deranged Englishman who believed he had a hay­
can with four horses in his stomach and who was freed from his delusion by a
doctor who, having assured him that he could feel the can and horses and so
gained his confidence, persuaded him that he possessed a remedy for reducing the
size of the things supposedly lodged in his stomach. Finally, he gave the mental
patient an emetic and made him vomit out of the window just as, with the doc­
tor's connivance, a haycan was passing by outside which the lunatic believed he
had vomited. Another way of effecting a cure of derangement consists in getting
madmen to perform actions which immediately refute the peculiar madness that
torments them. Thus, e.g., someone who imagined he had glass feet was cured by
a feigned attack by robbers, when he found his feet extremely useful for running
away. Another who took himself to be dead, remained motionless and would not
eat anything, came to his senses again when someone pretended to enter into his
madness. The lunatic was put in a coffin and laid in a vault in which there was
another coffin occupied by a man who at first pretended to be dead but who,

1 30

Subjective Mind

soon after he was left alone with the lunatic, sat up, expressed his pleasure at now
having company in death, and finally got up, ate some of the food there and told
the astonished lunatic that he had already been dead a long time and therefore
knew how the dead go about things. The lunatic was pacified by the assurance,
likewise ate and drank and was cured. Sometimes lunacy can also be cured by a
word, by ajoke acting immediately on the representation. For instance, a lunatic
who believed he was the Holy Ghost recovered when another lunatic said to him:
How can you be the Holy Ghost, when it's me? An equally interesting instance
is a watch-maker who imagined he had been guillotined although innocent. The
remorseful judge ordered that his head be given back to him, bur through an
unfortunate confusion a different, much worse, thoroughly useless head had been
put back on him. As this lunatic was once defending the legend according to
which St Dionysius had kissed his own severed head, another lunatic retorted:
'You arrant fool, what is St Dionysius supposed to have kissed his head with, with
his heel perhaps?' This question so shook the deranged watch-maker that he com­
pletely recovered from his quirk. A joke of this kind will, however, completely
dispel the madness only if this disease has already abated in intensity. 27

(y) Habit
§409
Self-feeling, immersed in the particularity of the feelings (of simple sensations,
and also desires, urges, passions, and their gratifications), is not distinguished
from them. Bur the self is implicitly a simple relation of ideality to itself, formal
universality, and this is the truth of the particular; in this life of feeling the self is
to be posited as this universality; thus it is the universality that distinguishes itself
from particularity, the universality that is for itself. This universality is not the
content-packed truth of the determinate sensations, desires, etc., for their content
does not yet come into consideration here. Particularity is, in this determination,
just as formal; it i� .only the particular being or immediacy of the soul in contrast
to its equally formal, abstract being-for-self. This particular being of the soul is
the moment of its bodiliness; here it breaks with this bodiliness, distinguishing
from it itself as its simple being and becomes the ideal, subjective substantiality of
this bodiliness, j ust as in its implicit concept (§389) it was the only the unquali­
fied substance ofbodiliness. 1
[Remark] This abstract being-for-self of the soul in its bodiliness is not yet I, not
the existence of the universal that is for the universal. It is bodiliness reduced to its
pure ideality, and bodiliness thus pertains to the soul as such. That is, just as space
and time as abstract asunderness, as, therefore, empty space and empty time, are
only subjective forms, pure intuition; so that pure being, which, owing to the sub­
lation in it of the particularity of bodiliness, i.e. of immediate bodiliness as such,
is being-for-self, is the entirely pure intuition, unconscious, bur the foundation

131

Anthropowgy, The Soul

o f consciousness. I t proceeds within itself to consciousness, since it has sublated
within itself the bodiliness, of which it is the subjective substance, and which is
still for it and constitutes a barrier. And thus it is posited as a subject for itself.2

§410
That the soul thus makes itself into abstract universal being, and reduces the par­
ticularity of feelings (of consciousness too) to a determination in it that j ust

habit.

In this way the soul has the content

in possession,

is, is

and contains it in such

a way that in such determinations it is not actually sentient, it does not stand
in relationship to them by distinguishing itself from them, nor is it absorbed in
them, but it has them in itself and moves in them, without sensation or con­
sciousness. The soul is free of them, in so far as it is no� interested in or occupied
with them; while it exists in these forms as its possessions, it is at the same time
open to other activity and occupations, in the sphere of sensation and the mind's
consciousness in general. 1
This self-incorporation of the particularity or bodiliness of the determinations
of feeling into the

being of the soul appears as a repetition of them,

and the pro­

duction of habit appears as practice. For, since this being is, in relation to the
natural-particular material that is put into this form, abstract universality, it is
universality of reflexion (§ 1 75): one and the same item, as an external plurality of
sensation, is reduced to its unity, and this abstract unity is posited. 2

[Remark]

Habit, like memory, is a hard point in organization of the mind; habit

is the mechanism of self-feeling, as memory is the mechanism of intelligence.
The

natural qualities and alterations of age, of sleeping and waking, are immedi­

ately natural; habit is the determinacy of feeling (as well as of intelligence, will,
etc., in so far as they belong to self-feeling) made into something that is natural,
mechanical. Habit has rightly been called a second nature: nature, because it is an
immediate being of the soul, a second nature, because it is an immediacy posited by
the soul, incorporating and moulding the bodiliness that pertains to the determ­
inations of feeling as such and to the determinacies of representation and of the
will in so far as they are embodied

(§40 1 ).3

In habit man's mode o f existence i s natural, and for that reason h e i s unfree
in it; but he is free in so far as the natural determinacy of sensation is by habit
reduced to his mere being, he is no longer different from it, is indifferent to it, and
so no longer interested, engaged, or dependent with respect to it. The unfreedom
in habit is partly j ust fonnal, pertaining only to the being of the soul; partly only

relative,

in so far as it really arises only in the

case

of bad habits, or in so far

as a habit is opposed by another purpose; the habit of right in general, of the
ethical, has the content of freedom. 4 The essential determination is the

liberation

from sensations that man gains through habit, when he is affected by them. The
different forms of habit may be determined as follows:

1 32

Subjective Mind

(a) The immediate sensation is posited as negated, as indifferent. Hardening
against external sensations (frost, heat, weariness of the limbs, etc., pleasant tastes,
etc.), as well as hardening of the hean against distress, is a strength by which
affection by such things as frost, etc.and distress, though it is of course sensed by
man, is just reduced to an externality and immediacy; the soul's universal being
maintains its abstract being-for-self in it, and self-feeling as such, consciousness,
reflection, and other purposes and activity, are no longer involved in it.5
(b) Indifference towards satisfaction; desires, urges are dulled by the habit of
their satisfaction. This is the rational liberation from them; monkish renunci­
ation and forcible repression do not free us from them, nor are they rational in
content. It goes without saying here that urges are kept in their natural place as
finite determinacies, and that they, like their satisfaction, are subordinated to the
rationality of the will as moments in it.6
(c) In habit as dexterity, the abstract being of the soul is supposed not only to
be held on to for itself, but to be imposed as a subjective purpose within bod­
iliness, which is to become subjugated and entirely pervious to it. In contrast
to such internal determination of the subjective soul, bodiliness is determined
as immediate external being and a barrier-the more determinate breach of the
soul, as simple being-for-self within itself, with its initial naturalness and imme­
diacy; the soul is thus no longer in its initial immediate identity and, now that it
is external, must first be reduced to such identity. The embodiment of determ­
inate sensations is, moreover, itself a determinate embodiment (§40 1 ) , and the
immediate bodiliness is a particularpossibility (a particular aspect of its differenti­
ated structure, a particular organ of its organic system) for a determinate purpose.
The incorporation of such a purpose in the body means that the implicit ideality
of the material in general, and of the determinate bodiliness, has been posited as
ideality, so that the soul exists as substance in its bodiliness in accordance with
the determinacy of its representing and willing. In dexterity bodiliness is then
rendered pervious, made into an instrument, in such a way that as soon as the
representation (e.g. a sequence of musical notes) is in me, the physical body too,
unresistingly and fluently, has expressed it correctly.?

Habit is a form that embraces all kinds and stages of mind's activity. The most
external of them, the individual's spatial determination, his upright stance, is
made by his will into a habit, an immediate, unconscious posture which always
remains a matter of his continuing will; man stands only because and in so far
as he wills it, and only so long as he unconsciously wills it. Similarly seeing,
and so on, is the concrete habit which immediately unites in one simple act
the many determinations of sensation, consciousness, intuition, intellect, etc.
Thinking, too, though wholly free, and active in the pure element of itself,
likewise requires habit and familiarity, this form of immediacy, by which it
is the unimpeded, pervaded possession of my individual self Only through
this habit do I exist for myself as thinking. Even this immediacy of thinking

Anthropology, The Soul

·

1 33

togetherness-with-oneself involves bodiliness (deficient habituation and long
continuation of thinking cause headaches); habit diminishes this sensation, by
making the natural determination into an immediacy of the soul. - But when
developed, and at work in the mind as such, habit is recollection and memory, and
is to be considered further below. 8
Habit is often spoken of disparagingly and taken to be a lifeless, contingent
and particular thing. Entirely contingent content can of course, like every other
content, take the form of habit, and it is the habit ofliving which brings on death,
or, albeit in a wholly abstract way, is death itself. Yet at the same time habit is the
most essential feature of the existence of all mental life in the individual subject,
enabling the subject to be concrete immediacy, to be soulfol ideality, enabling the
content, religious content, moral content, etc., to belong to it as this self, as this
soul, not in it merely implicitly (as predisposition) , nor as a transient sensation or
representation, nor as abstract inwardness, cut off from action and actuality, but
in its very being. In scientific studies of the soul and the mind, habit is usually
passed over, either as something contemptible or rather also because it is one of
the most difficult determinations. 9

Zusatz. We are habituated to the representation of habit; nevertheless to determ­
ine the concept of habit is difficult. For this reason we wish to give here some
further elucidations of this concept.
First of all, the necessity of the dialectical progression from derangement (con­
sidered in §408) to habit (treated in §§409 and 4 1 0) must be shown. To this
end we recall that in mania the soul endeavours to restore itself to perfect inner
harmony of mind out of the contradiction present berween its objective con­
sciousness and its fixed representation. This restoration can just as well fail as
succeed. For the individual soul, therefore, the attainment of free, internally har­
monious self-feeling appears as something contingent. But in itself the absolute
liberation of self-feeling, the soul's untroubled being-together-with-itself in all
the particularity of its content, is something thoroughly necessary; for in itself
the soul is absolute ideality, that which overarches all its determinacies; and it
lies in the concept of the soul that by sublation of the particularities which have
become entrenched in it, it proves to be the unlimited power over them, that it
reduces what is still immediate, what is in it as a being, to a mere property, to a
mere moment, in order by this absolute negation to become for its own self as a
free individuality. Now we have in fact already had to consider a being-for-self of
the self in the relationship of the human soul to its genius. There however this
being-for-self still had the form of externality, of separation into rwo individual­
ities, into a dominating and a dominated self; and berween these rwo sides there
was as yet no decided opposition, no contradiction, so that the genius, this determ­
inate inwardness, made its appearance in the human individual unhindered. By
contrast, at the stage we have now reached in the development of subjective
mind, we come to a being-for-self of the soul that has been brought about by

1 34

Subjective Mind

the concept of the soul through overcoming of the mind's inner contradiction
present in derangement, through sublation of the complete disruption of the self.
This being-together-with-one' s-own-self we call habit. In habit, the soul is no
longer captivated by a merely subjective particular representation and evicted by
it from the centre of its concrete actuality; it has so completely received into its
ideality the immediate and individualized content presented to it, has made itself
so at home in the content, that it moves about in it withfreedom. That is, whereas
in mere sensation I am contingently affected now by this and now by that, and
in sensation the soul is immersed in its content, loses itself in it, does not sense
its concrete self-as also happens with other mental activities as long as they
are something to which the subject is still unaccustomed-in habit, by contrast,
one enters a relationship not to a contingent individual sensation, representation,
desire, etc., but to one's own self, to a universal mode of action which constitutes
one's individuality, which is posited by oneself and has become one's own, and
just because of that one appears as free. The universal to which the soul relates
itself in habit is, however-in contrast to the self-determining concrete universal
which is present only for pure thinking-only the abstract universality produced
by reflection from the repetition of many individualities. It is only to this form of
universal that the natural soul, dealing with the immediate and therefore with the
individual, can attain. But the universal related to mutually external individualit­
ies is the necessary. Therefore although, on the one hand, by habit a man becomes
free, yet, on the other hand, habit makes him its slave. Habit is not an immedi­
ate, first nature, dominated by the individuality of sensations. It is rather a second
nature posited by soul. But all the same it is still a nature, something posited that
assumes the shape of immediacy, an ideality of beings that is itself still burdened
with the form of being, consequently something not corresponding to free mind,
something merely anthropological. 1 0
In that the soul has become self-relating ideality in the manner indicated above,
namely, by overcoming its disruption, its inner contradiction, it has extruded
from itself the bodiliness with which it was previously immediately identical,
and at the same time exerts the power of its ideality on the bodily element thus
released to immediacy. At this standpoint, therefore, we have to consider not the
indeterminate separation of an interior in general from a world it finds before it,
but the subjection of this bodiliness to the dominion of the soul. This subjug­
ation of bodiliness forms the condition of the soul's liberation, of its attaining
objective consciousness. Of course, in itself the individual soul is already cor­
poreally enclosed; being alive, I have an organic physical body and this is not
something alien to me; on the contraty, it belongs to my Idea, is the immediate,
external reality of my concept, constitutes my individual natural life. Therefore,
in passing, one must pronounce to be completely empty the idea of those who
suppose that strictly man should not have an organic body because this compels
him to take care of the satisfaction of his physical needs and thus diverts him
from his purely spiritual life and incapacitates him for true freedom. Even the

Anthropology, The Soul

1 35

unsophisticated religious man is far removed from this shallow view, since he
holds the satisfaction of his bodily needs worthy of being the object of his peti­
tion to God, to the eternal spirit. But philosophy has to recognize that mind is
only for its own self by opposing to itself materiality, both as its own bodiliness
and as an external world in general, and by bringing back what is thus differenti­
ated into unity with itself, a unity mediated by the opposition and by sublation of
it. Between the mind and its own body there is naturally an even more intimate
association than between the rest of the external world and mind. Just because
of this necessary connection of my body with my soul, the activity immediately
exerted by the soul on the body is not a finite, not a merely negative, activity.
First of all, then, I have to maintain myself in this immediate harmony of my soul
and my body; true, I do not have to make my body an end in itself as athletes
and tightrope walkers do, but I must give my body its due, must take care of
it, keep it healthy and strong, and must not therefore treat it with contempt or
hostility. It is just by disregard or even maltreatment of my physical body that I
would make my relationship to it one of dependence and of externally necessary
connection; for in this way I would make it into something-despite its identity
with me- negative towards me and consequently hostile, and would compel it to
rise up against me, to take revenge on my mind. If, by contrast, I conduct myself
in accordance with the laws of my bodily organism, then my soul is free in its
physical body. l l
Nevertheless, the soul cannot remain in this immediate unity with its body.
The form of immediacy of this harmony contradicts the concept of the soul, its
determination of being ideality relating to its own self In order to come into cor­
respondence to this its concept, the soul must do what at our standpoint it has
not yet done, it must make its identity with its body into an identity posited or
mediated by the mind, take possession of its body, form it into a pliant and skillfol
instrument of its activity, so transform it that in it soul relates to its own selfand
and that the body becomes an accident brought into accord with its substance,
freedom. The body is the middle term by which I come together with the external
world in general. So, ifl want to actualize my aims, then I must make my physical
body capable of carrying over this subjectivity into external objectivity. My body
is not by nature fitted for this; on the contrary, it immediately does only what
is appropriate to animal life. But the purely organic functions are not yet func­
tions performed at the instigation of my mind. For this service my body must first
be trained. Whereas in animals the body, in obedience to their instinct, imme­
diately accomplishes everything made necessary by the Idea of the animal, man,
by contrast, has first to make himself master of his body by his own activity. At
the beginning, the human soul pervades its physical body only in a quite inde­
terminately universal way. For this pervasion to become a determinate pervasion,
training is required. Initially the physical body here shows itself unsubmissive to
the soul, its movements are unsure and are given a strength that is now too great,
now too small for the purpose in hand. The correct measure of this force can only

1 36

Subjective Mind

be achieved when one directs a particular reflection on all the manifold circum­
stances of the externality in which one wants to actualize one's aims and measures
each individual movement of one's physical body in accordance with these cir­
cumstances. Therefore, even a decided talent can get it right straightaway every
time only in so far as he is technically trained. 12
If the activities of the body to be performed in the service of mind are often
repeated, they acquire an ever higher degree of adequacy, for the soul gains an ever
greater familiarity with all the circumstances to be considered, hence becomes
more and more at home in its expressions and consequently achieves a continu­
ally growing capacity for immediately embodying its inner determinations and
accordingly transforms the body more and more into its own property, into its
serviceable instrument; there thus arises a magical relationship, an immediate
operation of mind on body. 1 3
But since the individual activities o f man acquire by repeated practice the char­
acter of habit, the form of something received into recollection, into the univer­
sality of the mental interior, the soul brings into its expressions a universal mode
of acting to be handed on to others too, a rule. This universal is internally so
concentrated to simplicity that in it I am no longer conscious of the particular
differences between my individual activities. That this is so we see, for example,
in writing. When we are learning to write we must direct our attention on every
individual detail, on a vast number of mediations. By contrast, once the activity
of writing has become a habit with us, then our self has so completely mastered
all relevant individual details, has so infected them with its universality, that they
are no longer present to us as individual details and we keep in view only their
universal aspect. Thus we see, consequently, that in habit our consciousness is
at the same time present in the matter-in-hand, interested in it, yet conversely
absent from it, indifferent towards it; that our self just as much appropriates the
matter-in-hand as, on the contrary, it withdraws from it, that the soul on the
one hand completely penetrates into its expressions and on the other hand deserts
them, thus giving them the shape of something mechanical, of a merely natural
ejfect. I4

(c) THE A C TUA L S O UL

§41 1
The soul, when its bodiliness has been thoroughly trained and made its own,
becomes an individual subject for itself; and bodiliness is thus the externality as a
predicate, in which the subject is related only to itself. This externality represents
not itself, but the soul, of which it is the sign. As this identity of the inner with the
outer, the outer being subjugated to the inner, the soul is actual; in its bodiliness
it has its free shape, in which it feels Itselfand makes itselffelt, and which, as the
soul's work of an, has human, pathognomic and physiognomic, expression. 1

Anthropology, The Soul

1 37

[Remark] Human expression includes, e.g., the upright figure in general, the
formation especially of the hand, as the absolute tool, of the mouth, laughter,
weeping, etc., and the spiritual tone diffused over the whole, which at once
announces the physical body as the externality of a higher nature. This tone is
such a slight, indeterminate, and indescribable modification, because the figure
in its externality is something immediate and natural, and can therefore only be
an indeterminate and quite imperfect sign for the mind, unable to represent it in
its universality for itsel£ For the animal, the human figure is the highest form in
which the mind appears to it. Bur for the mind it is only its first appearance, and
speech is straight away its more perfect expression. The figure is indeed the mind's
proximate existence, but in its physiognomic and pathognomic determinacy it
is at the same time a contingency for the mind. To want to raise physiognomy
and especially cranioscopy to the rank of sciences, was therefore one of the most
vacuous notions, even more vacuous than a signatura rerum, which supposed that
we could recognize the healing power of a plant from its shape. 2
Zusatz. As we have already baldly asserted in §390 in anticipation, the actual soul
forms the third and last main section of Anthropology. We began our consider­
ation of anthropology with the soul that just is, still unseparated from its natural
determinacy; then, in the second main section, we passed on to the soul that cuts
ojffrom itself its immediate being and in the determinacies of this being is for
itselfin an abstract way, i.e., feeling soul; and now, in the third main section, we
come, as already indicated, to the soul that has developed out of that separation
into mediated unity with its naturalness, that in its bodiliness is for itself in a con­
crete way, hence actual soul. The transition to this stage of development is made
by the concept of habit considered in the previous Paragraph. For as we have
seen, in habit the ideal determinations of the soul acquire the form of a being, of
something external to its own self, and conversely, bodiliness on its side becomes
something unresistingly pervaded by the soul, something subjected to the liber­
ated power of the soul's ideality. Thus there arises a unity of this inner and this
outer, a unity mediated by the separation of the soul from its bodiliness and by
the sublation of this separation. This unity, which from being a produced unity
becomes an immediate unity, we call the actuality of the soul.
Adhe standpoint we have now reached, the body no longer comes into consid­
eration with respect to its organic process, but only in so far at it is an externality
posited ideally even in its reality and in so far as in it the soul, no longer restricted
to the involuntary embodiment of its inner sensations, makes its appearance with
as much.freedom as it has won sofor by overcoming what contradicts its ideality.
The involuntary embodiment of inner sensations considered at the close of the
first main section of Anthropology (§40 1 ) is, in part, something that man has
in common with animals. By contrast, the embodiments occurring with freedom
and now to be discussed, impart to the human body a peculiar mental stamp,
by which man is distinguished from animals far more than by any mere natural

1 38

determinacy. On his purely bodily side, man is not greatly different from the ape;
but by the mind-pervaded aspect of his body he is distinguished from that animal
to such a degree that a smaller difference obtains between the appearance of an
ape and that of a bird than between the body of a man and that of an ape.
But the mental expression is concentrated mainly in the face, because the head
is the real seat of the mental. In the rest of the body, which belongs more or less
to naturalness as such and, therefore, among civilized peoples is clothed out of
shame, the mental reveals itself particularly in the posture of the physical body.
Thus the artists of antiquity, incidentally, paid very particular attention to pos­
ture in their portrayals, when they gave intuitional expression to the mind above
all in its effusion into bodiliness. - So far as mental expression is produced by the
facial muscles, it is called, as we know, the play of features; gestures in the narrow­
er sense of the word proceed from the rest of the physical body. -Man's absolute
gesture is his upright position; only man shows himself capable of this, whereas
even the orang-outang can stand upright only with a stick. Man is not erect by
nature, originally; he makes himself stand upright by the energy of his will; and
although his stance, afrer it has become a habit, requires no further intense activ­
ity of will, yet it must always remain pervaded by our will if we are not to collapse
instantly.- The human arm and especially the hand are likewise peculiar to man;
no animal has such a flexible tool for external activity. The human hand, this tool
oftools, is suited to serve an endless multitude of expressions of the will. As a rule
we initially make gestures with the hand, then with the whole arm and the rest of
the physical body.3
Expression by looks and gestures presents an interesting object of consider­
ation. However, it is sometimes not altogether easy to discover the ground of
the determinate symbolic nature of certain looks and gestures, the connection of
their meaning with what they are in themselves. We do not wish to discuss here all
the relevant phenomena but only the commonest of them. Nodding, for a start,
means an affirmation, for by this we indicate a kind of submission. Bowing as
a mark of respect is in every case done only with the upper part of the body by
us Europeans, since in doing it we do not wish to surrender our independence.
Orientals, by contrast, express reverence for their master by throwing themselves
on the ground before him; they may not look him in the eye, for by doing so
they would be asserting their being-for-self, and only the master has the right
freely to survey the servant and slave. Shaking the head is a denial; for by this we
indicate making something wobble, knocking it over. Tossing the head expresses
contempt, elevating oneself above someone. Screwing up the nose denotes disgust as
of something evil-smelling. Frowning proclaims anger, a concentration of oneself
into oneself against an Other. We pull a longface when we see ourselves disap­
pointed in our expectation; for in that case we feel, as it were, let down. The most
expressive gestures have their seat in the mouth and in its surroundings, since it is
from the mouth that the expression of speech proceeds, involving many and var­
ied modifications of the lips. As for the hands, expressing astonishment by clapping

them over ones head is in a way an attempt to pull onesdf together over one's own
sdf. But shaking hands on a promise indicates, as is easy to see, unanimity. The
movement of the lower extremities, gait, is also very significant. Above all things,
gait must be cultivated; in it the soul must betray its mastery over the physical
body. But not merdy cultivation and the lack of it, but also slackness, an affected
manner, vanity, hypocrisy, etc., on the one hand, and orderliness, modesty, good
sense, candour, etc., on the other, express themselves in the peculiar style ofwalk­
ing; so that it is easy to distinguish people from one another by their gait.4
Incidentally, the cultivated man has a less animated play of looks and gestures
than the uncultivated. Just as the former bids the inward storm of his passions
to be calm, so he also observes outwardly a calm demeanour and imparts to the
voluntary embodiment of his sensations a certain measure of moderation; where­
as the uncultivated, lacking power over his interior, believes that he can make
himsdf intelligible only by a luxuriance of looks and gestures, but is thereby
sometimes seduced into grimacing and in this way acquires a comical air, because
in a grimace the interior at once completely externalizes itself and one thereby
lets each individual sensation pass over into one's entire reality, with the con­
sequence that, almost like an animal, one sinks exclusively into this determinate
sensation. The cultured individual does not need to be lavish with looks and ges­
tures; he possesses in talk the worthiest and most suitable means of expressing
himself; for speech is able immediately to receive and reproduce every modific­
ation of representation, which is why the ancients even went to the extreme of
making their actors appear with masks on their faces, and so, content with this
immobile physiognomy of character, dispensing altogether with the lively play of
the actors' looks.5
Now just as the voluntary embodiments of the mental discussed here become
through habit something mechanical, something requiring no particular effort of
will, so too, conversely, some of the involuntary embodiments of what is sensed
by the soul considered in §40 1 can also take place with consciousness and free­
dom. Above all the human voice belongs here; when the voice becomes speech, it
c�es to be an involuntary expression of the soul. Similarly laughing, in the form
of laughing at, becomes something produced with freedom. Sighing, too, is not
so much something uncontrollable as something wilful. Herein lies the justifica­
tion for discussing the soul-expressions just mentioned in two places,-with the
merely sentient soul and also with the actual soul. This is also why we pointed
out as far back as §40 1 that among the involuntary embodiments of the mental
there are many 'lying in the direction of pathognomy and physiognomy'-which
were to be treated in their turn in §4 1 1 above. The difference between these
two determinations is that the pathognomic expression relates more to transi­
ent passions, whereas the physiognomic expression concerns the character, hence
something permanent. However, the pathognomic becomes physiognomic when
the passions in a man hold sway not merely temporarily but permanently. The
lasting passion of anger, for example, firmly ingrains itself in the face; and so too

1 40

Subjective Mind

a sanctimonious nature gradually impresses itself in an indelible way on the face
and on the whole bearing of the body.
Every man has a physiognomic aspect, appears at first sight as a pleasant or
unpleasant, strong or weak, personality. According to this semblance one passes,
from a certain instinct, a first universal judgement on others. However, it is easy
to be mistaken in this, since this exterior, encumbered predominantly with the
character of immediacy, does not perfectly correspond to the mind but only in a
greater or lesser degree. Consequently, an unfavourable, like a favourable, exter­
ior can have behind it something different from what that exterior initially leads
one to suspect. The biblical saying: 'Beware of him whom God hath marked', is,
therefore, often misused; and a judgement based on physiognomic expression has
accordingly only the value of an immediate judgement, which can just as well be
untrue as true. For this reason, people have rightly retreated from the exaggerated
respect they formerly harboured for physiognomy, when Lavater created such a
stir about it and when people had high hopes of a massive contribution from it
to the highly regarded knowledge of human nature. Man is known much less by
his outward appearance than by his actiom. Even language is exposed to the fate of
serving just as much to conceal as to reveal human thoughts.6

§412
In itse[f matter has no truth within the soul; the soul, since it is for itself, cuts
itself off from its immediate being, and places this being over against itself as
bodiliness, which can offer no resistance to the soul's incorporation into it. The
soul, which has set its being in opposition to itself, sublated it and determined
it as its own, has lost the meaning of souL, of the immediacy of mind. The actual
soul in the habit of sensation and of its concrete self-feeling is in itself the ideality
of its determinacies, an ideality that is for itself; in its externality it is recoLLected
into itself, and is infinite relation to itself. This being-for-self of free universality
is the soul's higher awakening to the I, to abstract universality in so far as it is
for abstract universality, which is thus thinking and subject for itself, and in fact
determinately subject of its judgement in which the I excludes from itself the nat­
ural totality of its determinations as an object, as a world externaL to it, and relates
itself to that world so that in it it is immediately reflected into itself: comciousness. 1
Zusatz. The soul's pervasion of its bodiliness considered in the two previous Para­
graphs is not absolute, does not completely sublate the difference of soul and
body. On the contrary, the nature of the logical Idea, developing everything from
itself, requires that this difference still be given its due. Something of bodiliness
remains, therefore, purely organic and consequently withdrawn from the power
of the soul, so that the soul's pervasion of its body is only one side of the body.
The soul, when it comes to feel this limitation of its power, reflects itself into itself
and expels bodiliness from itself as something alien to it. By this reflection-into-self
the mind completes its liberation from the form of being, gives itself the form of

essence and becomes the /.2 I t is true that the soul, i n so far as i t is subjectivity
or selfishness, is already in itself!. But the actuality of the I involves more than
the soul's immediate, natural subjectivity; for the I is this universal, this simple
entity that in truth exists only when it has itself as object, when it has become the
being-for-selfof the simple in the simple, the relation of the universal to the univer­
sal. The universal relating to itself exists nowhere save in the I. In external nature,
as we have already said in the introduction to the theory of subjective mind, the
universal only attains the highest activation of its power by annihilation of the
individual reality, hence does not auain to actual being-for-self. The natural soul
too is initially only the realpossibility of this being-for-self. Only in the I does this
possibility become actuality. Therefore, in the I an awakening ensues ofa higher
kind than the natural awakening confined to the mere sensation of what is indi­
vidual; for the I is the lightning piercing through the natural soul and consuming
its naturalness; in the I, therefore, the ideality of naturalness, and so the essence of
the soul, becomesfor the soul. 3
The whole anthropological development of the mind presses on to this goal. AB
we here look back on this development, we recall how the human soul, in con­
trast to the animal soul which remains sunk in the individuality and limitation of
sensation, has raised itself above the limited content of what is sensed, a content
that contradicts its implicitly infinite nature, has posited this content ideally, and
particularly in habit has made it into something universal, recollected, total, into
a being. But we also recall how just in this way it has filled the initially empty
space of its inwardness with a content appropriate to it because of its universal­
ity, has posited being within itself, just as, on the other hand, it has transformed
its body into the image of its ideality, of its freedom, and thus has reached the
point of being the self-related, individually determined universal present in the I,
an abstract totality that isfor itselfand freed from bodiliness. Whereas in the sphere
of the merely sentient soul the self appears, in the shape of the genius, as a power
acting on the embodied individuality only from outside and at the same time only
from within, at the stage of the soul's development now reached, by contrast, the
self has, as we showed earlier, actualized itself in the soul's reality, in its bodiliness,
and, conversely, has posited being within itself; so that now the self or the I intuits
its own selfin its Other and is this self-intuiting. 4

B . Phenomenology of Mind
CONSCIOUSNESS

§413
Consciousness constitutes the stage of the mind's reflexion or relationship, of mind
as appearance. I is the infinite relation of mind to itself, but as subjective relation,
as certainty of itself, the immediate identity of the natural soul has been raised
to this pure ideal self-identity; the content of the natural soul is object for this
reflection that is for itself. Pure abstract freedom for itself discharges from itself
its determinacy, the soul's natural life, to an equal freedom as an independent
object. It is of this object, as external to it, that I is initially aware, and is thus
consciousness. I, as this absolute negativity, is implicitly identity in otherness; I is
itself and extends over the object as an object implicitly sublated, I is one side of
the relationship and the whole relationship- the light, that manifests itself and an
Other too.1
Zusatz. As we remarked in the Zusatz to the previous Paragraph, the I must be
conceived as the individually determined universal which, in its determinacy, in
its difference, relates itself to itself alone. This already implies that the I is imme­
diately negative relation to itself, consequently the unmediated opposite of its
universality abstracted from all determinacy, and thus is equally abstract, simple
individuality. 2 It is not only we, the onlookers, who thus differentiate the I into
its opposed moments; the I itself, in vinue of its individuality which is universal
within itself and thus differentiated from itself, is this distinguishing-itself-from­
itself, for as relating itself to itself, its exclusive individuality excludes itself from
itself, i.e. from individuality, and thereby posits itself as the opposite of itself
immediately joined together with individuality, as universality.3 But the determ­
ination of abstractly universal individuality essential to the I constitutes its being.
I and my being are therefore inseparably combined with each other; the differ­
ence of my being from me is a difference that is no difference. On the one hand,
being, as the absolutely immediate, indeterminate, undifferentiated, must of course
be distinguished from thinking, which differentiates itselfand by sublation of dif­
ference mediates itself with itself, must be distinguished from the I; yet, on the
other hand, being is identical with thinking, since thinking returns from all medi­
ation to immediacy, from all its self-differentiation to unpenurbed unity with
itself. The I is, therefore, being or has being as a moment within it. When I posit

Phenomenology ofMind

1 43

this being as an Other confronting me and at the same time as identical with me,
I am awareness and have the absolute certainty of my being. 4 This certainty must
not be regarded-as happens on the part of mere representation- as a kind of
property of the I, as a determination in its nature; it is to be conceived as the very
nature of the I, for the I cannot exist without distinguishing itself from itself and
being together with itself in what is distinguished from it, which simply means,
without being aware of itself, without having and being the certainty of itself.
Therefore, certainty is related to the I as freedom is to the will. Just as certainty
constitutes the nature of the I, so freedom constitutes the nature of the will. Ini­
tially, however, certainty is to be compared only with subjective freedom, with
wilfolness; only objective certainty, truth, corresponds to genuine freedom ofwill. 5
Accordingly, the I certain of itself is, initially, still wholly simple subjectivity, the
quite abstractlyfree, the completely indeterminate ideality or negativity of all limita­
tion. Repelling itself from itself, the I attains, therefore, at first only to something
that is formally, not actually, distinct from it. But as is shown in Logic, the dif­
ference that is in itself must also be posited, must be developed into an actual
difference. This development regarding the I proceeds in this way: the I does not
fall to the anthropological level, to the unconscious unity of the mental and the
natural, but remains certain of itself and maintains itself in its freedom; it lets its
Other unfold into a totality like the totality of the I, and just in this way makes it
change from something bodily belonging to the soul into something independently
confronting it, into an object in the strict sense of this word.6 The I is at first only
wholly abstract subjectivity, the merely formal, contentless distinguishing-itself­
from itself, and so the actual difference, the determinate content, is found outside
the I and belongs to objects alone. But since in itselfthe I already has difference
within itself or, in other words, since it is in itself the unity of itself and its Oth­
er, it is necessarily related to the difference existing in the object and immediately
reflected out of this its Other into itself The I thus overarches what is actually
distinguished from it, is together with itself in this its Other, and remains, in all
intuition, certain of itself. Only when I come to apprehend myself as I, does the
Other become an object to me, confront me, and at the same time get posited
ideally in me, and hence brought back to unity with me. That is why in the above
Paragraph the I was compared to light. Just as light is the manifestation of itself
and its Other, darkness, and can reveal itself only by revealing that Other, so too
the I is revealed to itself only in so far as its Other becomes revealed to it in the
shape of something independent of it.?
From this general discussion of the nature of the I it is already sufficiently
evident that since the I enters into conflict with external objects, it is something
higher than the impotent natural soul caught up in, so to speak, a childlike unity
with the world, than the soul in which, just because of its impotence, fall the
states of mental disease we considered earlier.

1 44

Subjective Mind

§414
The identity of the mind with itself, as it is first posited as I, is only its abstract
formal ideality. As soul in the form of substantial universality, mind is now sub­
jective reflection-into-itself, related to this substantiality as to the negative of
itself, something dark and beyond it. Hence consciousness, like relationship in
general, is the contradiction between the independence of the two sides and their
identity, in which they are sublated. The mind as I is essence; but since reality, in
the sphere of essence, is posited as in immediate being and at the same time as
ideal, mind as consciousness is only the appearance of mind. 1
Zusatz. The negativity which the wholly abstract I, or mere consciousness, exerts
on its Other is a still thoroughly indeterminate, superficial, not an absolute neg­
ativity. Consequently, at this standpoint there arises the contradiction that the
object is, on the one hand, within me, and on the other hand, has an independent
status outside me, like the darkness outside the light. To consciousness the object
appears not as an object posited by the I, but as an immediate, given object that
just is; for consciousness does not yet know that the object is in itseif identic­
al with the mind and is released to seemingly complete independence only by a
self-division of the mind. That this is so, only we know, we who have got as far
as the Idea of mind and have therefore risen above the abstract, formal identity
ofthe l.2

§415
Since I isfor itselfonly as formal identity, the dialectical movement of the concept,
the progressive determination of consciousness, does not look to it like its own
activity, but is in itself and for the I an alteration of the object. Consciousness
therefore appears differently determined according to the difference of the object
given, and its progressive formation appears as an alteration of th� determinations
of its object. I, the subject of consciousness, is thinking; the progressive logical
determination of the object is what is identical in subject and object, their absolute
interconnexion, that in virtue ofwhich the object is the subject's own. I
[Remark] Kantian philosophy may be most determinately considered as having
conceived the mind as consciousness, and as involving determinations only of
phenomenology, not of philosophy of mind. It considers I as relation to some­
thing lying beyond, which in its abstract determination is called the thing-in­
itself; and it conceives both the intelligence and the will solely according to this
finitude. If, in the concept of the faculty of reflective judgement, it does get to
the Idea of mind, subjectivity-objectivity, an intuitive intellect, etc., and even the
Idea of nature, still this Idea itself is again demoted to an appearance, namely to a
subjective maxim (see §58, lntro.). Therefore Reinholdhad what is to be regarded
as a correct sense of this philosophy when he conceived it as a theory of comcious-

Phenomenology ofMind

145

ness, under the name faculty of representation. Fichte's philosophy takes the same
standpoint, and Non-I is determined only as object of the I, only in consciousness;
it remains an infinite impetus, i.e. a thing-in-itself Both philosophies therefore
show that they have not reached the concept and not reached the mind as it is in
andfor itself, but only as it is in relation to an Other. 2
As regards Spinozism, it is to be noted against it that in the judgement by which
the mind constitutes itself as I, as free subjectivity in contrast to determinacy, the
mind emerges from substance, and philosophy, when it makes this judgement the
absolute determination of mind, emerges from Spinozism.3
Zusatz. ( 1 ) Although the progressive determination of consciousness proceeds
from its own interior and is also directed towards the object in a negative way,
and the object is thus altered by consciousness, yet this alteration appears to con­
sciousness as an alteration that comes about without its subjective activity, and
the determinations that it posits in the object count for it as belonging only to the
- object, as determinations that just are.
(2) With Fichte there is always the difficulty of how the I is to cope with the
Non-!. He does not get to any genuine unity of these two sides; this unity always
remains only a unity that ought to be, because at the outset the false presupposi­
tion is made that I and Non-I in their separateness, in theirJinitude, are something
absolute.4

§41 6
The goal o f mind as consciousness is to make its appearance identical with its
essence, to raise the certainty ofitselfto truth. The existence that mind has in con­
sciousness, has its finitude in the fact that it is the formal relation to itself, only
certainty; since the object is only abstractly determined as its own, or in the object
the mind is only reflected into itself as abstract I, this existence still has a content
that does not present itself as the mind's own content. 1

Zusatz. Mere representation does not distinguish between certainty and truth.
What is certain for it, what it regards as a subjective state agreeing with the
object, it calls true, no matter how trivial and bad the content of this subjective
state may be. Philosophy, by contrast, must distinguish the concept of truth
essentially from mere certainty; for the certainty which the mind has of itself at
the standpoint of mere consciousness is still something untrue, self-contradictory,
since here, along with the abstract certainty of being together with itself, mind has
the directly opposite certainty of its relationship to something essentially other
than itself. This contradiction must be sublated; the urge to resolve itself lies in
the contradiction itself.2 Subjective certainty must not retain any barrier in the

1 46

Subjective Mind

object, it must acquire genuine objectivity; and, conversely, the object, on its
side, must become mine not merely in an abstract manner but in every aspect
of its concrete nature. This goal is already glimpsed by reason that believes in itself,
but is attained only by the reason's knowledge, by conceptual cognition. 3

§417
The stages of this elevation of certainty to truth are mind as (a) consciousness
in general, which has an object as such, (b) self-consciousness, for which I is the
object, (c ) unity of consciousness and self-consciousness, where the mind intu­
its the content of the object as itself and intuits itself as determined in and for
itself; - reason, the concept ofmind. 1
Zusatz. The three stages of the rise of consciousness to reason indicated in the above
Paragraph are determined by the power of the concept, active in the subject and in
the object alike, and can therefore be considered as three judgements. 2 But as we
already remarked earlier, the abstract I, mere consciousness, as yet knows nothing
of this. Consequently when the non-!, which initially counts for consciousness
as independent, is sublated by the power of the concept at work in it, when the
object is given the form of a universal, of an internality, instead of the form of
immediacy, externality, and individuality, and when consciousness receives this
recollection into itself, then the I's own internalization, which comes about in j ust
this way, appears to it as an internalization of the object} Only when the object
has been internalized into the I and when consciousness has in this way developed
into self-consciousness, does mind know the power of its own internality as a power
present and active in the object. Thus what in the sphere of mere conscious­
ness is only for us, the onlookers, in the sphere of self-consciousness becomes
for the mind itself. Self-consciousness has consciousness for its object, hence con­
fronts it. But at the same time consciousness is also preserved as a moment in
self-consciousness itself. Self-consciousness necessarily goes on, therefore, to con­
front itself with another self-consciousness by repulsion of itself from itself and
in this to give itself an object which is identical with it and yet at the same time
independent. This object is initially an immediate, individual I. But when it is
freed from the form of one-sided subjectivity still clinging to it and conceived as a
reality pervaded by the subjectivity of the concept, consequently as Idea, then self
consciousness abandons its opposition to consciousness and advances to a mediated
unity with it and thereby becomes the concrete being-for-selfof the I, the absolutely
free reason that recognizes in the objective world its own self4
It hardly needs to be noted that reason, which in our exposition appears as the
third and last term, is not merely a last term, a result emerging from something
alien to it, but is, on the contrary, the foundation of consciousness and self­
consciousness, therefore the first term, and by sublation of these rwo one-sided
forms it proves to be their original unity and truth.5

( a ) CONS CIO USNESS A S S UCH

(ex) Sensory Consciousness
§418
Consciousness is initially immediate consciousness, its relation to the object
accordingly the simple, unmediated certainty of it; the object itself is therefore
similarly determined as immediate, as being and reflected into itself, further as
immediately individual; -sensory consciousness. 1
[Remark] Consciousness as relationship involves only the categories belonging
to the abstract I or to formal thinking; and these are, for it, determinations of
the object (§415) . Sensory consciousness is therefore aware of the object only
as a being, a something, an existing thing, an individual, and so on. It appears as
the richest in content, but it is the poorest in thoughts. That wealth of filling is
constituted by determinations of feeling; they are the material of consciousness
(§414), the substantial and qualitative element, that the soul, in the anthropo­
logical sphere, is and finds within itself The reflection of the soul into itself,
I, separates this material from itself, and gives it initially the determination of
being. 2 Spatial and temporal individuality, the here and the now, as I have
determined the object of sensory consciousness in the Phenomenology ofMind,
pp. 25 ff., strictly belongs to intuition. Here the object is initially to be taken only
in accordance with the relationship which it has to consciousness, namely some­
thing external to consciousness, and is not yet to be determined as external within
itself, or as being outside itself.3
-

Zusatz. The first of the three developmental stages of the phenomenological mind
mentioned in the previous Paragraph, namely consciousness, itself has within itself
three stages: a) sensory consciousness, �) perceiving consciousness, and y) intellec­
tual consciousness. In this sequence there is revealed a logical progression:
a) At first, the object is a wholly immediate object, which j ust is; it appears
thus to sensory consciousness. But this immediacy has no truth; we must
advance from it to the essential being of the object.4
�) When the essence of things becomes consciousness's object, it is no longer
sensory consciousness but perceiving consciousness. At this standpoint, indi­
vidual things are related to a universal, but only related to it; what occurs
here is, therefore, is not yet a genuine unity of individual and universal, but
only a mixture of these two sides. Herein lies a contradiction which leads
on to the third stage of consciousness, 5
y) to intellectual consciousness, where it finds its solution in so far as there the
object is reduced or elevated to the appearance of an interior that is for itself
Such an appearance is the living creature. In the contemplation of this, self­
consciousness is ignited; for in the living creature the object turns into the

1 48

Subjective Mind

subjective; there consciousness discovers its own self as the essential of the
object, it reflects itself out of the object into itself, becomes an object to
itself.6
After this general survey of the three developmental stages of consciousness, we
now turn first of all to sensory consciousness in more detail. This differs from the
other modes of consciousness, not by the fact that in it alone the object comes
to me through the senses, but rather by the fact that at the standpoint of sens­
ory consciousness the object, whether it be an interior or an outer object, has no
other thought-determination than firstly, that of being in general, and secondly, of
being an independent Other confronting me, something reflected into itself, an indi­
vidual confronting me as an individual, an immediate individual. The particular
content of the sensory, for example, smell, taste, colour, etc., belongs, as we saw in
§40 1 , to sensation. But the form peculiar to the sensory, being-external-to-its-own­
self, dispersion into space and time, is (as we shall see in §448) the determination
of the object apprehended by intuition, in such a way that for sensory conscious­
ness as such there remains only the above-mentioned thought-determination, in
virtue of which the manifold particular content of sensations concentrates itself
into a unit that is outside me, a unit that, at this standpoint, is known by me in
an immediate, individualized manner, contingently now enters my consciousness
and then disappears from it again; in general a unit that is, both in its existence
and in its constitution, a given for me, something, therefore, of which I know
neither why it is nor why it has this determinate nature, nor whether it is some­
thing true. 7
It is clear from this brief account of the nature of immediate or sensory con­
sciousness that it is a thoroughly inadequate form for the in and for itself universal
content of right, of the ethical and of religion, a form that spoils such content,
since in this consciousness what is absolutely necessary, eternal, infinite, and
internal is given a finite, individualized, self-external shape. So when people have
been willing to concede only an immediate knowledge of God, they have lim­
ited themselves to a knowledge which can assert of God that he is, that he exists
outside us, and that he seems to sensation to possess such and such properties.
Such a consciousness with its contingent assurances regarding the nature of the
divine, which for it lies in the beyond, gets no further than supposedly religious
tub-thumping and swanking. 8

§419
The sensory as something becomes an other, the reflection of the something into
itself, the thing, has many properties, and as an individual in its immediacy has
variouspredicates. The multiple individual of sensoriness thus acquires breadth-a
variery of relations, determinations of rejlexion, and universalities. 1 - These are
logical determinations posited by the thinker, i.e. here by the I. But for the I, as

Phenomenology ofMind

1 49

appearing, the object has undergone this change.2 When the object is determined
in this way sensory consciousness is perception.
Zusatz. The content of sensory consciousness is in its own self dialectical. The
content is supposed to be the individual; but by this very fact it is not an individu­
al but every individual, and just by excluding from itself the Other, the individual
content relates to another, shows that it goes beyond itself, that it is dependent
on another, is mediated by it and has another within itself. The proximate truth
of the immediately individual is therefore its relatedness to another. The determ­
inations of this relation are what are called determinations of reflection, and the
consciousness apprehending these determinations is perception.3

(�) Perception
§420
Consciousness, having passed beyond sensoriness, wants to take the object in
its truth, not as merely immediate, but as mediated, reflected into itself, and
universal. 1 The object is thus a combination of sensory determinations and exten­
ded thought-determinations of concrete relationships and connections. Hence
the identity of consciousness with the object is no longer the abstract identity of
certainty, but determinate identity, an awareness.2
[Remark] The more specific stage of consciousness at which Kantian philosophy
conceives the mind is perception, which is in general the standpoint of our ordin­
ary consciousness and more or less of the sciences. The sensory cenainties of indi­
vidual apperceptions or observations form the starring-point; these are supposed
to be elevated to truth, by being considered in their relation, reflected upon, gen­
erally by becoming, in accordance with determinate categories, at the same time
something necessary and universal, experiences. 3

Zusatz. Although perception stans from observation of sensory material, nevenhe­
less it does not stop there, does not confine itself to smelling, tasting, seeing,
hearing, and feeling, but necessarily goes on to relate the sensory to a not imme­
diately observable universal, to cognize each individualized entity as an internally
coherent whole-inforce, for example, to unifY all the expressions of force-and
to seek out the relations and mediations obtaining between individual things.
While therefore merely sensory consciousness only shows things, i.e., merely exhibits
them in their immediacy, perception by contrast apprehends the interconnection
of things, demonstrates that when such and such circumstances are present such
and such follows from them, and thus begins to demonstrate things as true.4 This
demonstration is, however, still a defective, not a final demonstration. For that by
which something is here supposed to be demonstrated is itself a presupposition,
consequently in need of demonstration; so that in this sphere one goes from pre­
suppositions to presuppositions and lapses into the progression to infinity. This is the

1 50

Subjective Mind

standpoint occupied by experience. Everything must be experienced. But if we are
supposed to be talking about philosophy, then we must rise above the demonstra­
tion that remains tied to presuppositions, above empiricism's demonstration, to
the proof of the absolute necessity of things. 5
Already in §4 1 5 it was said in passing that the progressive cultivation of con­
sciousness appears as an alteration of the determinations of its object. With ref­
erence to this point, it can be added here that while perceiving consciousness
sublates the individuality of things, posits them ideally and thereby negates. the
externality of the relation of the object to the I, the I withdraws into itself and
itself gains in inwardness, but consciousness regards this withdrawal into itself as
falling in the object.6

§421
This connection of the individual and universal is a mixture, since the individu­
al remains the being that lies at the foundation and remains firm in the face of
the universal, to which it is nevertheless related. The connection is therefore a
many-sided contradiction-in general berween the individual things of sensory
apperception, which are supposed to constitute thefoundation of universal exper­
ience, and the universality which is supposed rather to be the essence and the
foundation, -berween individuality, which constitutes independence, taken in its
concrete content, and the various properties which are on the contrary free from
this negative bond and from one another, and are independent universal matters
(see §§ 1 23 ff.) , and so on. This really comprises the contradiction of the finite
running through all forms of the logical spheres, most concretely in so far as the
something is determined as object (§§ 1 94 ff.) . 1

( y) Intellect
§422
The. proximate truth of perception is that the object is rather appearance, and
its reflection-into-itself is by contrast an interior and universal that is for itself.
The consciousness of this object is intellect. 1 - This interior is, on the one hand,
the sublated multiplicity of the sensory and is in this way abstract identity; but
on the other hand, because of that, it contains the multiplicity too, but as inner
simple difference, which remains self-identical in the change of appearances. This
simple difference is the realm of the laws of appearance-a tranquil, universal
copy ofit.2
Zusatz. The contradiction indicated in the previous Paragraph gets its first res­
olution by the fact that the manifold determinations of the sensory, which are
independent relatively both to one another and to the inner unity of each indi­
vidual thing, are reduced to the appearance of an interior that is for itself, and
the development of the object thus progresses from the contradiction of its

Phenomenology ofMind

151

reflection-into-selfand its reflection-into-other to the essential relationship o f it to
its own self. But when consciousness ascends from the observation of immedi­
ate individuality and from the mixture of the individual and the universal, to
the conception of the interior of the object, and thus determines the object in
a manner similar to the I, then the I becomes intellectual consciousness. Only
in this non-sensory interior does the intellect believe it has what is genuinely
real.3 At first, however, this interior is something abstractly identical, undiffer­
entiated within itself, an interior of this kind is presented to us in the categor­
ies offorce and of cause. The genuine interior, by contrast, must be described
as concrete, as differentiated within itself Conceived in this way, it is what we
call law. For the essence of law, whether this relates to external nature or the
ethical world order, consists in an inseparable unity, in a necessary interior con­
nection, of distinct determinations. Thus through law punishment is necessarily
linked with crime; to the criminal, punishment can indeed appear as something
alien to him, but the concept of crime essentially involves its opposite, pun­
ishment. Similarly, as regards external nature, for example the law of planetary
motion (according to which, as we know, the squares of the periods of revolu­
tion vary as the cubes of the distances) must be conceived as an inner necessary
unity of distinct determinations.4 This unity is, of course, only comprehended
by the speculative thinking of reason, but it is already discovered by the intel­
lectual consciousness in the multiplicity of phenomena. Laws are the determ­
inations of the intellect inherent in the world itself; therefore, the intellectual
consciousness finds in laws its own nature again and thus becomes an object to
itsel£5

§423
The law, initially the relationship of universal, permanent determinations, has,
in so far as its difference is the inner difference, its necessity within itself; each
of the determinations, since it is not externally distinguished from the other,
itself lies immediately in the other. 1 But in this way the inner distinction is
what it is in truth, the distinction within itself, or the distinction which is no
distinction.2- When the form is determined in this general way, consciousness
has implicitly disappeared; for consciousness as such involves the independence of
the subject and object relatively to each other. The I in its judgement has an
object which is not distinct from it-itself,-selfconsciousness.3

Zusatz. What has been said in the above Paragraph about the inner difference con­
stituting the essence of law, namely, that this difference is a difference which is no
difference, holds good equally of the difference that exists in the I as an object
to itself. Just as law is something differentiated within itselfand not merely rel­
atively to something else, is something identical with itself in its difference, so,
too, is the I that has itself for object, that is aware of itself. Therefore, when
consciousness, as intellect, is aware of laws, it is in relationship to an object in

1 52

Subjective Mind

which the I finds again the counterpart of its own self and is thus on the point of
developing into selfcomciousness as such.4 But since, as we remarked in the Zusatz
to §422, the merely intellectual consciousness does not as yet get as far as com­
prehending the unity of distinct determinations present in law, i.e. dialectically
developing from one of these determinations its opposite, this unity still remains
for this consciousness something dead, something, consequently, not in agree­
ment with the activity of the I. In the living creature, by contrast, consciousness
beholds the veryprocess of positing and sublating the distinct determinations, per­
ceives that the difference is no difference, i.e., no absolutely fixed difference. For
life is that interior which does not remain an abstract interior but enters wholly
into its expression; it is something mediated by the negation of the immediate, of
the external, but sublates this very mediation into immediacy, -a semory,external,
and at the same time simply internal, existence, a material entity in which the
asunderness of the parts appears sublated and the individual appears reduced to
something ideal, to a moment, to a member of the whole; in short, life must be
conceived as an end in itself, as an end which has its means within itself, as a
totality in which each distinct moment is alike end and means.5 It is, therefore,
in the consciousness of this dialectical, this living unity of what is distinct that
self-consciousness is kindled, the consciousness of the simple ideal entity that is its
own object and is thus differentiated within itself, -awareness of the truth ofthe
natural, of the I. 6
( b ) SELF- CONS CIO USNESS

§424
The truth of consciousness is selfcomciousness and the latter is the ground of
the former, so that in existence all consciousness of another object is self­
consciousness; I am aware of the object as mine (it is my represention), thus in
it I am aware of me} -The expression of self-consciousness is I = !;-abstract
freedom, pure ideality. -ln this way it is without reality, for the I itself, which is
the object of itself, is not such an object, because there is no distinction between
itself and the object. 2
Zusatz. In the expression, I = I, is enunciated the principle of absolute reason and
freedom. Freedom and reason consist in this: I raise myself to the form of l = I, I
recognize everything as mine, as I, I grasp every object as a member in the system
of what I myself am,-in short, they consist in this: I have in one and the same
consciousness I and the world, in the world I find myself again and, conversely,
in my consciousness I have what is, what has objectivity.3 This unity of the I and
the object constituting the principle of mind is, however, at first only present
in an abstract way in immediate self-consciousness, and is known only by us, the
onlookers, not yet by self-consciousness itself. Immediate self-consciousness does
not yet have for its object the I = I, but only the I; therefore, it is free only for

1 53

Phenomenology ofMind

us , not for itself, is not yet aware of its freedom, and has only the basis of freedom
within itself, but not yet genuinely actual freedom.4

§425
Abstract self-consciousness is the first negation of consciousness, therefore also
burdened with an external object, formally with the negation of itself; thus it
is at the same time the preceding stage, consciousness, and is the contradiction
between itself as self-consciousness and itself as consciousness. 1 Consciousness
and the negation in general are already implicitly sublated in the I
I; so as
this certainty of itself in contrast to the object, it is the urge to posit what it is
implicitly, - i.e. to give content and objectivity to the abstract awareness of itself,
and conversely to free itself from its sensoriness, to sublate the objectivity that is
given and to posit it as identical to itself. The two things are one and the same, the
identification of its consciousness and self-consciousness. 2
=

Zusatz. The defect of abstract self-consciousness lies in this: it and consciousness
are still two different things confronting each other, they have not yet achieved a
reciprocal equilibrium. In consciousness, we see the tremendous diffirence, on the
one side, of the /, this wholly simple entity, and on the other side, of the infinite
variety ofthe world. This opposition of the I and the world, which does not yet
come to genuine mediation here, constitutes the finitude of consciousness. Self
consciousness, by contrast, has its finitude in its still wholly abstract identity with
its own self. What is present in the I I of immediate self-consciousness is only a
difference that ought to be, not yet a posited, not yet an actual difference. 3
This rift between self-consciousness and consciousness forms an inner contra­
diction of self-consciousness with itself, because self-consciousness is also the stage
directly preceding it, consciousness, and consequently is the opposite of itsel£ That
is to say, since abstract self-consciousness is only the first, hence still conditioned,
negation of the immediacy of consciousness, and not already absolute negativity,
i.e., the negation of that negation, infinite affirmation, it has itself still the form
of a being, of an immediate, of something that, in spite of, or rather just because
of, its differenceless inwardness, is still filled by externality. Therefore, it contains
negation not merely within itselfbut also outside itself, as an external object, as a
non-!, and it is j ust this that makes it consciousness.4
The contradiction here outlined must be resolved, and the way in which this
happens is that self-consciousness, which has itself as consciousness, as I, for its
object, develops the simple ideality of the I into a real diffirence, and thus by sub­
lating its one-sided subjectivity gives itself objectivity; this process is identical with
the converse, by which the object is at the same time posited subjectively by the I, is
immersed in the inwardness of the self, and thus the dependence, present in con­
sciousness, of the I on an external reality is annihilated. Self-consciousness thus
gets to the point where it does not have consciousness alongside it, is not externally
=

1 54

Subjective Mind

combined with consciousness, but genuinely pervades it and contains it dissolved
within its own self.5
To reach this goal, self-consciousness has to traverse three developmental
stages.

a) The first of these stages displays to us the individual self-consciousness that
is immediate, simply identical with itself, and at the same time, in con­
tradiction with this, related to an external object. Thus determined, self­
consciousness is the cenainty of itself as the being in face of which the
object has the determination of something only seemingly independent,
but is in fact a nullity. This is desiring selfconsciousness. 6
�) At the second stage, the objective I acquires the determination of another
I, and hence arises the relationship of one self-consciousness to another self
consciousness, and between these two the process of recognition. Here, self­
consciousness is no longer merely individual self-consciousness, but in it
there already begins a unification of individuality and universality.?
y) Funhermore, when the otherness of the selves confronting each other sub­
lares itself and these, in their independence, nevenheless become identical
with each other, the third stage emerges,- universal self-consciousness. s

(a) Desire

§426
Self-consciousness, in its immediacy, is an individual and desire-the contradic­
tion of its abstraction which is supposed to be objective, or of its immediacy,
which has the shape of an external object and is supposed to be subjective. For the
certainty of itself that has emerged from the sublation of consciousness, the object
is determined as a nullity, and for the relation of self-consciousness to the object
its abstract ideality is likewise determined as a nullity. 1

Zusatz. As we have already remarked in the Zusatz to the previous Paragraph,
desire is the form in which self-consciousness appears at the first stage of its devel­
opment. Here in the second main part of the theory of subjective mind, desire
has as yet no funher determination than that of urge, in so far as urge, without
being determined by thinking, is directed on an external object in which it seeks
to satisfY itself. But the necessiry for the urge so determined to exist in self­
consciousness, lies in this: self-consciousness (as we likewise already brought to
notice in the Zusatz to the previous Paragraph) is also the stage immediately pre­
ceding it, namely consciousness, and is aware of this inner contradiction. Where
something identical with itself bears within itself a contradiction and is filled with
the feeling of its implicit identity with itself as well as with the opposite feel­
ing of its inner contradiction, then there necessarily emerges the urge to sublate
this contradiction.2 The non-living entity has no urge because it is incapable
of enduring contradiction; it perishes when the Other of itself forces its way

Phenomenology ofMind

155

into it. By contrast, the ensouled creature and the mind necessarily have urge,
since neither the soul nor the mind can be, without having contradiction with­
in themselves and either feeling it or being aware of it.3 But, as indicated above,
in the immediate and therefore natural, individual, exclusive self-consciousness,
the shape assumed by contradiction is that self-consciousness (whose concept
consists in being in relationship to its own self, in being I
I) still enters, on
the contrary, into relationship to an immediate Other not posited ideally, to an
external object, to a non-!, and is external to its own self, since although in itse/fit is
a totality, a unity of the subjective and the objective, it nevertheless exists initially
as a one-sided, as a merely subjective thing, which only gets to be a totality in and
for itselfby the satisfaction of desire. Despite this inner contradiction, however,
self-consciousness remains absolutely certain of itself because it is aware that the
immediate, external object has no genuine reality but is, on the contrary, a nullity
in comparison to the subject, with merely seeming independence, and is, in fact,
something that does not deserve and is not able to subsist for itself, but must
perish by the real power of the subject. 4
=

§427
Self-consciousness, therefore, is aware of itself implicitly in the object, which in
this relation is conformable to the urge. In the negation of the rwo one-sided
moments as the I' s own activiry, this identiry comes to be for the I. To this activ­
ity the object, which in itself and for self-consciousness is the selfless, can offer no
resistance; the dialectic of self-sublation, which is the object's nature, exists here
as this activity of the I. In this process the given object is posited subjectively, j ust
as subjectivity divests itself of its one-sidedness and becomes objective to itself. 1

Zusatz. The self-conscious subject is aware of itself as in itself identical with the
external object, aware that the object contains the possibility of satisfYing the
desire, that the object is, therefore, conformable to the desire and that j ust for
this reason desire is aroused by the object. Relation to the object is therefore
necessary to the subject. In the object, the subject beholds its own lack, its own
one-sidedness, sees in the object something belonging to its own essence and yet
missing from it. Self-consciousness is in a position to sublate this contradiction
since it is not j ust being, but absolute activity; and it sublates the contradiction
by taking possession of the object whose independence is, so to speak, only a pre­
tence, satisfies itself by consuming it and, since it is an end in itself, maintains
itself in this process.2 Here the object must perish; for here both of them, the
subject and the object, are immediate, and the only way in which they can be in
a unity is by the negation of the immediacy, and first ofall, qf the immediacy of
the selfless object.3 By the satisfaction of desire, the implicit identity of the sub­
ject and the object is posited, the one-sidedness of subjectivity and the seeming
independence of the object are sublated. But in being annihilated by the desiring
self-consciousness the object may seem to succumb to a completely alien power.

Subjective Mind

1 56

This is, however, only a semblance. For the immediate object must, by its own
nature, by its concept, sublate itsel£ since in its individuality it does not corres­
pond to the universality of its concept. Self-consciousness is the appearing concept
of the object itself. In the annihilation of the object by self-consciousness, the
object perishes, therefore, by the power of its own concept which is only internal
to it and, j ust because of that, seems to come to it only from outside.4 The object
is thus posited subjectively. But by this sublation of the object the subject, as
we have already remarked, sublates its own lack, its disintegration into a distinc­
tionless I I and an I related to an external object, and it gives its subjectivity
objectivity just as much as it makes its object subjective.
=

§428
The product of this process is that I joins together with itself, and is thereby sat­
isfied for itself, actualized. On the external side it remains, in this return, determ-­
ined initially as an individual, and has maintained itself as such, because its
relation to the selfless object is only negative, hence the object is only consumed.
So desire in its satisfaction is in general destructive, as it is in its content self
centred, and since the satisfaction has only happened in the individual case, and
this is transitory, the desire reproduces itself again in the satisfaction. 1
Zusatz. The relationship of desire to the object is still completely one of self­
centred destruction, not one offashioning. In so far as self-consciousness relates
as fashioning activity to the object, the object gets only the form of the subject­
ive, a form acquiring a subsistence in it, while in its matter the object is preserved.
By contrast, the satisfaction of self-consciousness caught up in desire, since this
self-consciousness does not yet possess the power to endure the Other as an inde­
pendent entity, destroys the independence of the object, so that the form of the
subjective does not attain any subsistence in the object. 2
Like the object of desire and desire itself, the satisfaction of desire, too, is neces­
sarily something individual, transient, yielding to the incessant renewal of desire.
It is an objectification constantly remaining in contradiction with the universality
of the subject, and yet all the same stimulated again and again by the felt defi­
ciency of immediate subjectivity, an objectification which never absolutely attains
its goal but only gives rise to the progression ad infinitum. 3

§429
But the self-feeling which the I gets in the satisfaction does not, on the inner side
or in itself, remain in abstract being-for-selfor in its individuality; as the negation
of immediacy and of individuality the result involves the determination of uni­
versality and of the identity of self-consciousness with its object. The judgement
or diremption of this self-consciousness is the consciousness of a free object, in
which I has awareness of itself as I, but which is also still outside it.

Phenomenology ofMind

1 57

Zusatz. On the external side, as we remarked in the Zusatz to the previous Para­
graph, immediate self-consciousness remains caught up in the tedious alterna­
tion, continuing to infinity, of desire and its satisfaction, in subjectivity relapsing
into itself again and again from its objectification. On the inner side, by contrast,
or in accordance with the concept, self-consciousness has, by sublation of its sub­
jectivity and of the external object, negated its own immediacy, the standpoint
of desire, has posited itself with the determination of otherness towards its own
self, has filled the Other with the /, has changed it from something selfless into a
free, into a selfish object, into another I. It has in this way brought itself as a dis­
tinct I face to face with its own self, but in doing so has raised itself above the
self-centredness of merely destructive desire. 1

(�) Recognizant Self-consciousness
§430
There is a self-consciousness for a self-consciousness, at first immediately, as one
thing for another. In the other as I, I immediately behold my own self, but I also
behold in it an immediately real object, another I absolutely independent in face
of mysel£ The sublation of the individuality of self-consciousness was the first
sublation; self-consciousness is thereby determined only as particular. 1 - This
contradiction supplies the urge to show itself as a free self, and to be there as a
free selffor the other, - the process of recognition.2

Zusatz. The second stage in the development of self-consciousness, indicated in
the heading of the above Paragraph, initially still has the determination of imme­
diacy in common with the self-consciousness of the first stage of development,
which is caught up in desire. In this determination lies the massive contradiction
that, since the I is what is wholly universal, absolutely pervasive, interrupted by
no limit, the essence common to all men, the two selves here relating to each oth­
er constitute one identity, so to speak one light, and yet they are also two selves,
which subsist in complete rigidity and inflexibility towards each other, each as a
reflection-into-self, absolutely distinct from and impenetrable by the other. 3

§431
The process is a combat; for I cannot be aware of myself as myself in the other,
in so far as the other is an immediate other reality for me; I am consequently
bent on the sublation of this immediacy of his. Equally I cannot be recognized
as an immediate entity, but only in so far as I sublate the immediacy in myself,
and thereby give reality to my freedom. But this immediacy is at the same
time the bodiliness of self-consciousness, in which, as in its sign and tool, self­
consciousness has its own self-feeling, as well as its being for others and its relation
that mediates between itself and them. 1

1 58

Subjective Mind

Zusatz. The more precise shape of the contradiction indicated in the Zusatz to
the previous Paragraph is this. The two self-conscious subjects in relationship to
each other, since they have an immediate reality, are natural, bodily, thus exist
in the manner of a thing subjected to alien power, and they approach each other
as such; yet at the same time they are quite free and may not be treated by each
other as only immediate realities, as merely natural entities. To overcome this con­
tradiction, it is necessary that the two selves opposing each other should, in their
reality, in their being-for-another, posit themselves as and recognize themselves as
what they are in themselves or by their concept, namely, not merely natural but
free beings.2 Only in this does true freedom come about; for since this consists
in the identity of myself with the other, I am only genuinely free when the oth­
er is also free and is recognized by me as free.3 This freedom of the one in the
other unites men in an internal manner, whereas need and necessity bring them
together only externally.4 Therefore, men must will to find themselves again in
one another. But this cannot happen as long as they are caught up in their imme­
diacy, in their naturalness; for it is just this that excludes them from one another
and prevents them from being free for one another. Freedom demands, there­
fore, that the self-conscious subject neither let his own naturalness persist nor
tolerate the naturalness of others; on the contrary, indifferent towards reality, he
should in individual, immediate contest put his own and the other's life at stake
to win freedom. Only through combat, therefore, can freedom be won; the assur­
ance of being free is not enough for that; at this standpoint man demonstrates his
capacity for freedom only by exposing himself, and others, to the danger ofdeath. 5

§432
The combat of recognition is thus a life and death struggle; each of the two self­
consciousnesses puts the other's life in danger, and exposes itself to it-but only
in danger, for each is equally bent on maintaining his life, since it is the embodi­
ment of his freedom. The death of one, which dissolves the contradiction in one
respect by the abstract, therefore crude, negation of immediacy, is thus in the
essential respect, the reality of recognition which is sublated together with the
death, a new contradiction and a higher one than the first.1
Zusatz. The absolute proof of freedom in the fight for recognition is death. The
combatants, even by exposing themselves to the risk of death, posit the natural
being of both of them as a negative, they prove that they regard it as a nullity.
But by death, naturalness is negated in fact and in this way its contradiction with
the spiritual, with the I, is at the same time resolved. This resolution is, however,
only quite abstract, only of a negative, not a positive kind. For even if only one
of two combatants fighting for mutual recognition perishes, then no recognition
comes about, for the survivor exists with recognition no more than the dead.
Consequently, death gives rise to the new and greater contradiction, that those

Phenomenology ofMind

159

who b y fighting have proved their inner freedom, have nevertheless not attained
to a recognized reality of their freedom.
To prevent possible misunderstandings with regard to the standpoint just out­
lined, we must here add the remark that the fight for recognition in the extreme
form here indicated can only occur in the state of nature, where men live only
as individuals; by contrast it is absent from civil society and the political state
because what constitutes the result of this combat, namely recognition, is already
present there. For although the state may arise by force, it does not rest on force;
force, in producing the state, has brought into existence only what is justified
in and for itself, the laws, the constitution. What predominates in the state is
the spirit of the people, custom, and law. There man is recognized and treated
as a rational being, as free, as a person; and the individual, on his side, makes
himself worthy of this recognition by overcoming the naturalness of his self­
consciousness and obeying a universal, the will that is in andfor itself, the law;
he thus behaves towards others in a manner that is universally valid, recognizing
them-as he wishes others to regard him-as free, as persons. In the state, the
citizen derives his honour from the post he fills, from the trade he follows, and
from his working activity of any other kind. In this way his honour has a con­
tent that is substantial, universal, objective, and no longer dependent on empty
subjectivity; honour of this kind is still lacking in the state of nature where indi­
viduals, whatever they may be and whatever they may do, want to compel others
to recognize them. 2
But it is clear from what has j ust been said that duelling must definitely not be
confused with the fight for recognition that constitutes a necessary moment in
the development of the human mind. Unlike this fight, duelling does not belong
to the natural state of men, but to a more or less developed form of civil society
and the state. Duelling has its strictly world-historical place in the feudal system
which was supposed to be a lawful condition, but was so only to a very small
degree. There the knight, no matter what he might have done, wanted to be
esteemed as not having lost face, as being completely spotless. This is what the
duel was supposed to prove. Although the law of the jungle was elaborated into
certain forms, yet its absolute basis was egotism. Consequently, its practice was
not a proof of rational freedom and genuinely civic honour, but rather a proof of
brutality and often of the shamelessness of a mentality claiming outward honour,
despite its depravity. Duelling is not met with among the peoples of antiquity,
for the formalism of empty subjectivity, the subject's wish to be esteemed in his
immediate individuality, was completely alien to them. They had their honour
only in their solid unity with that ethical relationship which is the state. But in
our modern states duelling can hardly be said to be anything else but a contrived
return to the brutality of the Middle Ages. At best, duelling in the former military
was able to have a tolerably rational sense, namely, that the individual wished to
prove that he had another and higher aim than to get himselfkilled for a pittance. 3

1 60

Subjective Mind

§433
Because life is as essential as freedom, the combat ends initially as one-sided neg­
ation with an asymmetry: one of the combatants prefers life, maintains himself
as individual self-consciousness, but surrenders his chance of recognition, while
the other holds fast to his relation to himself and is recognized by the first in his
subjugation: the relationship ofmastery and bondage. 1
[Remark] The combat of recognition and the subjugation under a master is the
appearance in which man's social life, the beginning of states, emerged. Force,
which is the basis in this appearance, is not on that account the basis of right,
though it is the necessary and legitimate moment in the passage of the condition of
self-consciousness engrossed in desire and individuality into the condition of uni­
versal self-consciousness. This moment is the external beginning of states, their
beginning as it appears, not their substantialprinciple. 2
Zusatz. The relationship of master and bondsman contains only a relative sub­
lation of the contradiction between the particularity reflected into itself of the
distinct self-conscious subjects and their mutual identity. For in this relationship
the immediacy of particular self-consciousness is, initially, sublated only on the
side of the bondsman, but on the master's side it is preserved. While the natural­
ness of life on both these sides persists, the self-will of the bondsman surrenders
itself to the will of the master, receives for its content the purpose of the lord who,
on his part, receives into his self-consciousness, not the bondsman's will, but only
care for the support of the bondsman's natural vitality; in such a manner that
in this relationship the posited identity of the self-consciousness of the subjects
related to each other comes about only in a one sided way 3
As regards the historicity of the relationship under discussion, it can be
remarked that the ancient peoples, the Greeks and Romans, had not yet risen to
the concept of absolute freedom, since they did not know that man as such, as this
universal I, as rational self-consciousness, is entitled to freedom. On the contrary,
with them man was held to be free only if he was born as a free man. With them,
therefore, freedom still had the determination of naturalness. That is why there
was slavery in their free states and bloody wars arose among the Romans in which
the slaves tried to free themselves, to obtain recognition of their eternal human
rights.4

§434
On the one hand, this relationship is a community of need and of care for its satis­
faction, since the means of mastery, the bondsman, must likewise be maintained
in his life. In place of the brute destruction of the immediate object there ensues
acquisition, preservation, and formation of it, as the intermediary in which the
two extremes of independence and non-independence join together; - the form

o f universality i n satisfaction o f need is a permanent means and a provision that
takes care of and secures the future.1

§435
Secondly, in line with the distinction between them, the master has in the bonds­
man and his service the intuition of the validity of his individual being-for-self;
and he has it by means of the sublation of immediate being-for-self, a sublation,
however, which occurs in another. - But this other, the bondsman, works offhis
individual will and self-will in the service of the master, sublates the inner imme­
diacy of desire and in this alienation and in the fear of the master he makes a
beginning ofwisdom-the transition to universal selfconsciousness. 1

Zusatz. Since the bondsman works for the master and therefore not in the exclus­
ive interest of his own individuality, his desire acquires the breadth of being not
only the desire of a particular individual but containing within itself the desire
of another. Accordingly, the bondsman rises above the selfish individuality of his
natural will, and to that extent stands higher, as regards his worth, than the mas­
ter who, caught up in his egotism, beholds in the bondsman only his immediate
will and is recognized by an unfree consciousness in a formal way.2 This subjuga­
tion of the bondsman's egotism forms the beginning of genuine human freedom.
This quaking of the individuality of the will, the feeling of the nullity of egot­
ism, the habit of obedience, is a necessary moment in the education of every man.
Without having experienced the discipline that breaks self-will, no one becomes
free, rational, and capable of command.3 To become free, w acquire the capacity
tor self-government, all peoples must therefore undergo the severe discipline of
subjection to a master. It was necessary, for example, that after Solon had given
the Athenians democratic free laws, Pisistratus gained a power by which he com­
pelled the Athenians to obey those laws. Only when this obedience had taken
root did the mastery of the Pisistratids become superfluous. Thus Rome, too, had
to live through the strict government of the kings before, by the breaking of nat­
ural egotism, that marvellous Roman virtue could arise, a patriotism ready for any
sacrifice. Bondage and tyranny are, therefore, in the history of peoples a neces­
sary stage and hence something relatively justified. Those who remain bondsmen
suffer no absolute injustice; for he who has not the courage to risk his life tO win
freedom, deserves to be a slave; and if by contrast a people does not merely ima­
gine that it wants tO be free but actually has the vigorous will to freedom, then no
human power will be able hold it back in the bondage of merely being governed
passively. 4
As we have said, this servile obedience forms only the beginning of freedom,
because that to which the natural individuality of self-consciousness submits is
not the genuinely universal, rational will that is in andfor itself, but the individual,
contingent will of another subject. Here, then, only one moment of freedom

1 62

Subjective Mind

emerges, the negativity of egotistic individuality; whereas the positive side of free­
dom attains actuality only when, on the one hand, the servile self-consciousness,
liberating itself both from the individuality of the master and from its own indi­
viduality, grasps what is in andfor itself rational in its universality, independent
of the particularity of the subjects; and when, on the other hand, the master's
self-consciousness is brough t, by the community of need and the concern for its
satisfaction obtaining between him and the bondsman, and also by beholding the
sublation of the immediate individual will objectified for him in the bondsman,
to recognize this sublation as the truth in regard to himself too, and therefore to
submit his own selfish will to the law of the will that is in and for itself.5

( y) Universal Self-consciousness
§436
Universal self-consciousness is the affirmative awareness of oneself in the other self. 1
Each self as free individuality has absolute independence, but i n virtue o f the neg­
ation of its immediacy or desire it does not distinguish itself from the other; it is
universal and objective; and it has real universality in the form of reciprocity, in
that it is aware of its recognition in the free other, and is aware of this in so far as it
recognizes the other and is aware that it is free. 2
[Remark] This universal mirroring of self-consciousness, the concept that is
aware of itself in its objectivity as subjectivity identical with itself and therefore
universal, is the form of consciousness of the substance of every essential
spirituality-of the family, the fatherland, the state, as well as of all virtues,
of love, friendship, courage, of honour, of fame. But this appearance of the
substantial may also be separated from the substantial, and be maintained for
itself in baseless honour, hollow fame, etc.3

Zusatz. The result of the struggle for recognition, brought about by the concept
of mind, is universal self-consciousness, which forms the third stage in this sphere,
i.e. that free self-consciousness for which its object, the other self-consciousness,
is no longer, as in the second stage, an unfree but an equally independent self­
consciousness. At this standpoint, therefore, the mutually related self-conscious
subjects, by sublation of their unequal particular individuality, have risen to the
consciousness of their real universality, of theirfreedom befitting all, and hence to
the intuition of their determinate identity with each other. The master confront­
ing the bondsman was not yet genuinely free, for he was still far from intuiting
his own self in the other. Consequently, it is only by the liberation of the bonds­
man that the master, too, becomes completely free.4 In this condition of universal
freedom, in being reflected into myself, I am immediately reflected into the oth­
er, and, conversely, in relating myself to the other I immediately relate to my own
self. Here, therefore, we have the tremendous diremption of mind into different
selves which are, both in and for themselves and for one another, completely free,

Phenomenology ofMind

1 63

independent, absolutely obdurate, resistant, and yet at the same time identical
with one another, hence not self-subsistent, not impenetrable, but, as it were,
merged together. This relationship is thoroughly speculative in kind; and if one
supposes that the speculative is something remote and inconceivable, one need
only consider the content of this relationship to convince oneself of the ground­
lessness of this opinion. The speculative, or rational, and true consists in the
unity of the concept, or the subjective, and the objective. This unity is obviously
present at the standpoint in question. It forms the substance of ethical life, espe­
cially of the family, of sexual love (there the unity has the form of particularity) ,
of patriotism, this willing of the universal aims and interests of the state, of love
towards God, of bravety too, when this is staking one's life on a universal cause,
and lastly, also of honour, provided that this has for its content not the indifferent
singularity of the individual but something substantial, genuinely universal.5

§437
This unity of consciousness and self-consciousness involves in the first place the
individuals as shining into each other. But in this identity the distinction between
them is a wholly indeterminate diversity or rather a distinction which is no dis­
tinction. Hence their truth is the universality and objectivity of self-consciousness
which are in and for themselves- reason. 1
[Remark] Reason as the Idea (§2 1 3) appears here in the following determination:
the general opposition between concept and reality, which are unified in the Idea,
has here taken the specific form of the concept existing for itself, of consciousness
and, confronting it, the externally present object. 2
Zusatz. What we have called in the previous Paragraph universal self-consciousness,
is in its truth the concept of reason, the concept in so far as it exists not merely
as the logical Idea, but as the Idea developed into self-consciousness. For as we
know from the Logic, the Idea consists in the unity of the subjective, or the
concept, and objectivity. But universal self-consciousness has shown itself to us
as such a unity, for we have seen that, in its absolute difference from its Oth­
er, it is yet at the same time absolutely identical with its Other. It is precisely
this identity of subjectivity and objectivity that constitutes the universality now
attained by self-consciousness, a universality which overarches these two sides or
jJ'tlrticularities and into which they dissolve. But self-consciousness, in attaining
this universality, ceases to be self-consciousness in the strict or narrower sense
of the word, since it is just this adherence to the particularity of the self that
belongs to self-consciousness as such. By relinquishing this particularity, self­
consciousness becomes reason.3 In this context the name 'reason' only has the
sense of the initially still abstract or formal unity of self-consciousness with its
object. This unity establishes what must be called, in determinate contrast to
the truthfol, the merely correct. My representation is correct by mere agreement
with the object, even when the object only remotely corresponds to its concept

1 64

Subjective Mind

and thus has hardly any truth at all . Only when the truthfol content becomes an
object for me does my intelligence acquire the significance of reason in a concrete
sense. Reason in this sense will have to be considered at the close of the devel­
opment of theoretical mind (§467), where, emerging from an opposition of the
subjective and objective developed further than it has been so far, we shall cognize
reason as the contentfol unity of this opposition.4
( c ) REA S ON

§438
Reason is the truth that is in and for itself, and this is the simple identity of the
subjectivity of the concept with its objectivity and universality. The 1.miversality
of reason, therefore, signifies the object, which in consciousness qua conscious­
ness was only given, but is now itself universal, permeating and encompassing
the I. Equally it signifies the pure I, the pure form overarching the object and
encompassing it within itself. 1

§439
Self-consciousness is thus the certainty that its determinations are objective, are
determinations of the essence of things, just as much as they are its own thoughts.
Hence it is reason, which, since it is this identity, is not only the absolute sub­
stance, but the truth as awareness. For truth here has, as its peculiar detenninacy, as
its immanent form, the pure concept existing for itself, I, the certainty of itself as
infinite universality. This truth that is aware is the mind. 1

C. Psychology, The Mind
§440
The mind has determined itself into the truth of soul and of consciousness, of
that simple immediate totality and of this knowledge, which is now an infinite
form and thus not restricted by the content derived from the soul, does not stand
in relationship to it as object, but is knowledge of the substantial totality that
is neither subjective nor objective. Mind, therefore, sets out only from its own
being and is in relationship only with its own determinations. 1
[Remark] Psychology accordingly studies the faculties or universal modes o f activ­
ity of the mind as such, intuition, representing, recollecting, etc., desires, etc.,
disregarding both the content, which in appearance is found in empirical rep­
resentation, in thinking also and in desire and will, and the forms in which the
content occurs, in the soul as a natural determination, and in consciousness itself
as an object of consciousness that is present for itself.2 This, however, is not
an arbitrary abstraction. Mind itself is this elevation above nature and natural
determinacy, and above the involvement with an external object, i.e. above the
material element in general; this is what its concept has turned out to be. All it has
to do now is to realize this concept of its freedom, i.e. sub late the form of imme­
diacy with which it once more begins. The content that is elevated to intuitions
is its sensations; similarly it is its intuitions that are transformed into representa­
tions, and its representations that are transformed again into thoughts, etc.3
Zusatz. Free mind, or mind as such, is reason as it divides into, on the one hand,
pure infinite form, boundless knowledge, and, on the other hand, the object
identical with this knowledge. Here, this knowledge still has no other content
than its own self, with the determination that the knowledge embraces within
itself all objectivity, that consequently the object is not something coming to
the mind from outside and incomprehensible to it.4 Mind is thus the absolutely
universal certainty ofitself,free ofany opposition whatever. Therefore, it possesses
the confidence that in the world it will find its own self, that the world must be
friendly to it, that, just as Adam said of Eve that she was flesh of his flesh, so
mind has to seek in the world reason of its own reason. We have found reason
to be the unity of the subjective and objective, the unity of the concept existing
for its own self and of reality. Since therefore mind is the absolute cenainty of
itself, is knowledge of reason, it is knowledge of the unity of the subjective and

1 66

Subjective Mind

objective, knowledge that its object is the concept and the concept is objective. 5 Free
mind thereby shows itself to be the unity of the two universal stages of develop­
ment considered in the first and second main parts of the theory of subjective
mind, namely, of the soul, this simple spiritual substance or immediate mind, and
of consciousness or appearing mind, the self-separation of this substance. For the
determinations of free mind have subjectivity in common with those of the soul,
and objectivity in common with those of consciousness. The principle of free mind
is to posit the being.r of consciousness as something soulfol, and conversely to
make the soulful into something objective. Free mind stands, like consciousness,
as one side confronting the object, and is at the same time both sides and there­
fore, like the soul, a totality. Accordingly, whereas the soul was the truth only as
an immediate unconscious totality, and whereas in consciousness, by contrast, this
totality was divided into the I and the object external to it, so that there knowledge
still had no truth, thefree mind is to be cognized as the self-knowing truth. *6
However, knowledge of truth does not itself initially have the form of truth,
for at the stage of development now reached, the knowledge is still something
abstract, the formal identity of the subjective and objective. Only when this iden­
tity has developed into an actual difference and has made itself into the identity
of itself and its difference, when mind thus emerges as a totality differentiated
within itself determinately, only then has that certainty achieved its verification. 8

§441
The soul is finite, in so far as it is determined immediately or by nature. Con­
sciousness is finite, in so far as it has an object. Mind is finite, in so far as, though
it no longer has an object, it has a determinacy in its knowledge, it is finite, that
Therefore, when people assen that we cannot know the truth, this is the extreme of blasphemy.
People are not aware of what they are saying here. If they were aware of it they would deserve to
have the truth withdrawn from them. The modern despair of the knowability of truth is alien to all
speculative philosophy as well as to all genuine religiosity. A poet no less religious than thoughtful,
Dante, expressed in such a pregnant fashion his belief in the knowability of truth, that we permit
ourselves to convey his words here. He says in the Founh Canto of the Paradiso, verses 124-30:
*

Io veggio ben, che giarnmai non si sazia
Nostro intelletto, se'! Ver no lo illustra
Di fuor dal qual nessun vero si spazia.
Posasi in esso, come fera in lustra,
Tosto che giunro !'ha; e giunger puollo; ­
Se non, ciascun desio sarebbe frustra.
[I see that nought can fill the mind's vast space,
Unless Truth's light dwell there as denizen,
Beyond which nothing true can find a place.
In that it rests, like wild beast in its den,
When it attains it; and it can attain,
Else frustrate would be all desires of men.
Dean Plumptre's translationF

Psychology, The Mind

1 67

is, in virtue of its immediacy, and, what is the same thing, in virtue of being sub­
jective or as the concept. And it makes no difference, what is determined as its
concept, and what as its reality. If utterly infinite objective reason is posited as its
concept, then the reality is knowledge or intelligence; or if knowledge is taken as the
concept, then its reality is this reason and the realization of the knowledge, mak­
ing reason its own. Hence the finitude of mind consists in the fact that knowledge
does not grasp the being-in-and-for-itself of its reason, or, equally, in the fact that
reason has not attained to full manifestation in knowledge. 1 Reason at the same
time is only infinite reason in so far as it is absolute freedom, hence presupposes
itself in advance of its knowledge and thereby makes itself finite and is the eternal
movement of sublating this immediacy, of comprehending its own self and being
knowledge of reason. 2
Zusatz. As we have seen, free mind is by its concept perfect unity of the subjective
and objective, of form and content, consequently absolute totality and therefore
infinite, eternal. We have cognized it as knowledge of reason. Because free mind
is this, because it has the rational for its object, it must be described as the infin­
ite being-for-self of subjectivity. Therefore it belongs to the concept of mind that
within it the absolute unity of the subjective and objective be not merely in itself,
but also for itself, and therefore object of knowledge.3 On account of this con­
scious harmony prevailing between knowledge and its object, between form and
content, a harmony that excludes all separation and so all alteration, one can call
the mind, in accordance with its truth, the eternal, as well as the perfectly blessed
and holy. For only that may be called holy which is rational and knows of the
rational. Therefore, neither external nature nor mere sensation has a right to that
name. Immediate sensation which has not been purified by rational knowing is
burdened with the determinacy of the natural, the contingent, of being-external­
to-its-own-self, of falling asunder. Therefore, in the content of sensation and of
natural things infinity consists only in something fonnal, abstract. By contrast,
mind is, by its concept or its truth, infinite or eternal in this concrete and real sense:
that it remains absolutely self-identical in its difference. That is why we must
declare mind to be the image of God, to be the divinity of man. 4
But in its immediacy-for even mind as such assumes initially the form of
immediacy-mind is not yet truly mind; on the contrary, its existence does not
here stand in absolute agreement with its concept, with the divine prototype,
the divine in it is here only the essence which has yet to develop into complete
appearance. Immediately, therefore, mind has not yet grasped its concept, it only
is rational knowledge, but does not yet know itself as such. Thus mind, as was
already said in the Zusatz to the previous Paragraph, is initially only the indeterm­
inate certaiJJ.ty of reason, of the unity of the subjective and objective. Therefore
here it still lacks detenninate cognition of the rationality of the object. To attain
this, mind must liberate the implicitly rational object from the form of contin­
gency, individuality and externality which at first clings to it, and thereby free

1 68

Subjective Mind

itself from its relation to an Other. The finitude of the mind gets in the way of this
liberation. For so long as mind has not yet reached its goal, it does not yet know
itself as absolutely identical with its object, but finds itself limited by it.5
The finitude of mind must not, however, be taken for something absolutely
fixed, but must be recognized as a mode of the appearance of mind, which is nev­
ertheless infinite by its essence. This implies that the finite mind is immediately
a contradiction, an untruth, and at the same time is the process of sublating this
untruth. This struggling with the finite, the overcoming of the limit, constitutes
the stamp of the divine in the human mind and forms a necessary stage of the
eternal mind. Therefore, if one speaks of the limits of reason, this is worse than it
would be to speak of wooden iron. It is infinite mind itself that presupposes its own
self as soul, as well as consciousness, thereby making itselffinite, but equally posits
as sublated this home-made presupposition, this finitude, the implicitlY' sublated
opposition of consciousness to the soul on the one hand, and on the other hand
to an external object.6 This sublation has a different form in free mind than in
consciousness. For consciousness the progressive determination of the I assumes
the semblance of an alteration of the object independent of the activity of the I,
with the consequence that in the case of consciousness the logical consideration
of this alteration fell only in us, whereas it is for the free mind that the mind itself
produces from itself the developing and altering determinations of the object,
that the mind itself makes objectivity subjective and subjectivity objective. The
determinations ofwhich it is aware are of course inherent in the object, but at the
same time posited by mind. In free mind there is nothing only immediate. There­
fore, when people speak of 'facts of consciousness' which for the mind are what
is primary and must remain an unmediated given for it, it is to be noted on this
that of course at the standpoint of consciousness a great deal of such given material
is found, but the free mind has to demonstrate and so explain these facts as deeds
of the mind, as a content posited by it, not leave them as independent things given
to it.7

§442
The progression of mind is development, in so far as its existence, knowledge,
has within itself, as its kernel and purpose, determinedness in and for itself, i.e.
the rational, and so the activity of translation is purely only a formal transition
into manifestation and therein a return into itself. In so far as knowledge is
encumbered with its initial determinacy, is at first only abstract or formal, the
goal of mind is to produce objective fulfilment, thus at the same time producing
the freedom of its knowledge. 1
[Remark] Here one must not think o f the development o f the individual
associated with anthropological development, where the faculties and powers are
regarded as successively emerging and presenting themselves in existence. For a
long time knowledge of this progression was highly valued (by the philosophy

Psychology, The Mind

1 69

of Condillac), as if such a supposed natural emergence could display the genesis
of these faculties and explain them. In this procedure there is an unmistakable
tendency to make the various modes of the mind's activity comprehensible in
the context of a unitary mind, and to display an interconnection of necessity.
But the categories employed in doing so are in general of an impoverished
sort. In particular the governing principle is that the sensory is taken, no doubt
rightly, as primary, as the initial foundation, but that from this starting-point
the subsequent determinations appear as emerging only in an affirmative manner,
and the negative aspect of mind's activity, by which this material is spiritualized
and sublated in its sensoriness, is misconceived and overlooked. In this approach,
the sensory is not merely what is empirically primary, but continues to serve as
the genuinely substantial foundation. 2
Similarly, if the activities of mind are regarded only as expressions, as forces in
general, perhaps with a specification of their utility, i.e. as serving some other
interest of the intelligence or the heart, then no ultimatepurpose is available. The
ultimate purpose can only be the concept itself, and the activity of the concept
can only have the concept itself as its purpose, viz. to sublate the form of imme­
diacy or of subjectivity, to reach and to grasp itself, to liberate itself to its own self
In this way the so-called faculties of mind in their distinctness from each other are
to be seen only as stages of this liberation. And this alone is to be regarded as the
rational way of considering the mind and its various activities.3

Zusatz. The existence of mind, namely knowledge, is the absolute form, i.e. the
form having the content within itself, or the concept that exists as concept and
gives itself its own reality. That the content or object is for knowledge a given
content or object, coming to it from outside, is therefore only a semblance, by
sublation of which the mind proves to be what it is in itself, namely, absolute self
determination, the infinite negativity of what is external to mind and to itself, the
ideality that produces all reality from itself The advance of mind has, therefore,
only this meaning: that this semblance be sublated, that knowledge prove itself to
be the form that develops all content from itself. Thus the activity of mind, far
from being restricted to a mere acceptance of the given, must, on the contrary, be
called a creative activity, though the productions of the mind, in so far as it is
only the subjective mind, do not yet acquire the form of immediate actuality but
remain more or less ideal.4

§443
As consciousness has as its object the preceding stage, the natural soul (§413),
s o mind has consciousness as its object or rather makes i t its object; i.e. where­
as consciousness is only in itselfthe identity of the I with its other (§415), the
mind posits this identityfor itself, so that mind is now aware of it, of this concrete
unity. Its productions conform to the determination of reason, that the content
be both the content that is in itself, and the mind's own content, in accordance

1 70

Subjective Mind

with freedom. Thus, when in its initial stage the mind is determined, this determ­
inacy is twofold, a determinacy ofwhat is and a determinacy of what is its own; by
the former, the mind finds within itself something that is, by the latter it posits it
only as its own. 1 The way of mind is therefore
{a) to be theoretical, dealing with the rational as its immediate determinacy
and now positing it as its own; or to liberate knowledge from presup­
position and therefore from its abstractness, and to make the determin­
acy subjective. When knowledge is thus posited as determined in and for
itself within itself, and the determinacy posited as its own determinacy, and
thereby knowledge asfree intelligence, 2 it is
(b) will, practical mind, which is initially likewise formal, has a content as only
its own content, immediately wills it and now liberates the determination
of its will from its subjectivity, from the one-sided form of its content, so
that it
(c ) becomes objective to itself asfree mind, in which this double one-sidedness
is sublated.3
Zusatz. Whereas one cannot very well say of consciousness that it has an urge,
since it has the object immediately, mind, by contrast, must be conceived as urge
because it is essentially activity, and is in fact initially:
{a) the activity by which the seemingly alien object acquires- instead of the
shape of something given, individualized and contingent-the form of some­
thing recollected, subjective, universal, necessary, and rational. By undertaking
this alteration of the object, mind reacts against the one-sidedness of consciousness
which relates to objects as immediate beings and does not know them as sub­
jective. As such it is theoretical mind. In theoretical mind the urge to know is
dominant, the craving for information. Of the content of this information I know
that it is, has objectivity, and at the same time that it is in me and thus subjective.
Here, therefore, the object no longer has, as at the standpoint of consciousness,
the determination of a negative towards the I. 4
(b) Practical mind sets out from the opposite end. Unlike theoretical mind, it
does not start from the seemingly independent object, but from its own aims and
interests, thus from subjective determinations, and first proceeds to make these
into something objective. In doing this it reacts against the one-sided subjectivity
of self-consciousness enclosed within itself, just as theoretical mind reacts against
consciousness that is dependent on a given object.5
Theoretical and practical mind reciprocally complement each other precisely
because they are distinct from one another in the manner indicated. This
distinction is, however, not absolute; for theoretical mind, too, deals with its
own determinations, with thoughts, and, conversely, the aims of the rational will
are not something pertaining to the particular subject but something that is in

Psychology, The Mind

171

and for itself Both modes of mind are forms o f reason; for both i n theoretical
and in practical mind what is produced, albeit by different routes, is that in
which reason consists: a unity of the subjective and objective.6 At the same time,
however, these twin forms of subjective mind have this defect in common: in
both of them the starting-point is the seeming separateness of the subjective and
objective, and the unity of these opposed determinations is supposed to be first
produced. This is a defect lying in the nature of mind, since mind is not a being,
immediately complete, but is rather that which produces its own self, the pure
activity, sublation of the presupposition of the opposition of the subjective and
objective, a presupposition which, in itself, was made by the mind itself.?

§444
Both the theoretical and the practical mind are still in the sphere of the sub­
jective mind in general. They are not to be distinguished as active and passive.
Subjective mind is productive; but its productions are formal. Inwards, the the­
oretical mind's production is only its ideal world and the attainment of abstract
self-determination within itself. Practical mind deals, it is true, only with self­
determinations, with its own material, but a material that is likewise still formal,
and thus with a restricted content, for which it gains the form of universality. 1
Outwards, since the subjective mind is a unity of soul and consciousness, and
is thus also a reality in being, a reality at once anthropological and conformable
to consciousness, its products, in the theoretical mind, are the word, and in the
practical mind (not yet deed and action, but) enjoyment. 2
[Remark] Psychology, like logic, is one of those sciences which in recent times
have still derived least profit from the more general cultivation of the mind and
the deeper concept of reason. It is still in an extremely poor condition. The turn
effected by Kantian philosophy has indeed attached greater importance to it, even
claiming that it should (and that in its empirical condition) constitute the found­
ation of metaphysics, a science which is to consist of nothing but the empirical
apprehension and analysis of the facts of human consciousness, merely as facts,
just as they are given. Assigning psychology this position, in which it is mixed
with forms from the standpoint of consciousness and with anthropology, has not
altered its own condition at all, but it has added one new factor: the abandon­
ment, both for the mind as such, and for metaphysics and philosophy generally,
of knowledge ofthe necessity ofthat which is in andfor itself, the abandonment of
the concept and the truth.3
Zusatz. Only soul is passive, the free mind is essentially active, productive. It is
therefore a mistake when theoretical mind is sometimes distinguished from prac­
tical mind by describing the former as the passive and the latter as the active. In
appearance this distinction is of course right enough. Theoretical mind seems

1 72

Subjective Mind

only to accept what is present, whereas practical mind is supposed to produce
something not yet externally present. In truth, however, as we already indicated
in the Zusatz to §442, theoretical mind is not a merely passive acceptance of an
Other, of a given object, but shows itself as active by raising the implicitly rational
content of the object out of the form of externality and individuality into the
form of reason. But, conversely, practical mind too has a passive side, since ini­
tially its content is given to it, though it is given internally, not from outside, and
so it is an immediate content, not posited by the activity of the rational will and it
first has to be made such a posited content by means of thinking knowledge, thus
by means of theoretical mind.4
No less than the distinction just discussed between the theoretical and practic­
al, the distinction must be pronounced untrue, according to which intelligence
is supposed to be the limited, and the will, by contrast, the unlimited. Quite
the reverse: the will can be declared to be the more limited, since it engages in
struggle with external, recalcitrant matter, with the exclusive individuality of the
actual, and at the same time is confronted by other human wills; whereas intel­
ligence as such only advances, in its expression, as far as the word, this fleeting,
vanishing, wholly ideal realization emerging in an unresisting element, so that in
its expression intelligence remains completely together with itself, satisfies itself
within itself, proves to be an end in itself, the divine, and, in the form of conceptu­
al cognition, brings about the unlimited freedom and reconciliation of mind with
itself.5
Both modes of subjective mind, intelligence as well as will, initially have, how­
ever, onlyformal truth. For in both the content does not immediately correspond
to the infinite form of knowledge, so that this form is thus still not genuine�y
foljilled.
In the theoretical sphere the object does become, on the one hand, subjective
but, on the other hand, a content of the object initially still remains behind out­
side the unity with subjectivity. And so the subjective here constitutes only a form
that does not absolutely pervade the object and the object is, therefore, not some­
thing posited through and through by mind. In the practical sphere, by contrast,
the subjective does not yet have immediately any genuine objectivity, since in its
immediacy the subjective is not something absolutely universal, a being in and for
itself, but something pertaining to the singularity of the individual.
When mind has overcome the defect just described, thus when its content no
longer stands in conflict with its form, when the certainty of reason, of the unity
of the subjective and objective, is no longer formal but rather foljilled, when,
therefore, the Idea forms the sole content of mind, then subjective mind has
reached its goal and passes over into objective mind. Objective mind knows its
freedom, recognizes that its subjectivity, in its truth, constitutes absolute objectiv­
ity itself, and it apprehends itself not merely within itselfas Idea but brings itself
forth as an externallypresent world of freedom. 6

(a) THEORE TICA L MIND

§445
The intelligence finds itself determined; this is its semblance from which in its
immediacy it sets our; but as

knowledge,

intelligence consists in positing what is

found as its own. Its activity deals with the empty form offinding reason, and
its aim is that its concept should be for the intelligence, i.e. to be reason for
whereby the

itself,
content also becomes rational for the intelligence. This activity is cog­

nition. The formal knowledge of cenainty elevates itself, since reason is concrete,
to determinate and conceptual knowledge. The course of this elevation is itself
rational, and consists in a necessary transition, determined by the concept, of one
determination of intelligent activity (a so-called faculty of mind) into another.
The refutation, involved in cognition, of the semblance of finding the rational,
sets out from the cenainty, i.e. the faith of intelligence in its capacity for rational
knowledge, in the possibility of being able to appropriate reason, which intelli­
gence and the content implicitly are. 1
[Remark] The differentiation of intelligence from

will is often taken in the incor­

rect sense that each has a fixed and separate existence of its own, so that volition
could be without intelligence, or the activity of intelligence could be without will.
The possibility ofwhat is called educating the

heart without the intellect,

intellect without the heart, and the

the possibility too that there are one-sidedly intellect­

less heans and heanless intellects, only indicates at most that bad, intrinsically
untrue existences occur; but it is not philosophy's business to take such untruths
of contingent reality and of representation for the truth, to take what is bad for
the nature of the matter. -A host of other forms used of the intelligence, that it
receives impressions from outside,

admits them, that representations arise through

influences of external things as

the causes, etc., belong to a categorial standpoint
which is not the standpoint of the mind or of philosophical inquiry. 2
A favorite reflexion-form is that ofpowers and faculties of soul, intelligence, or
mind. Thefaculty, like the power, is the fixed determinacy ofa content, represented
as reflexion-into-itself. The power

(§ 1 36)

is indeed the

infinity of form, of the
indifference of content

inner and the outer, but its essential finitude involves the

to form (ibid. , Remark) . In this lies the irrationality which is introduced into the
mind, as well as into nature, by this reflexion-form and by regarding the mind
as an assemblage ofpowers. Whatever can be

distinguished in the mind's activity
independent determinacy and the mind is in this way made
an ossified mechanical collection. It here makes no difference whatsoever if we
substitute the expression activities for faculties and powers. Isolating the activities
is stereotyped as an

similarly makes the mind j ust an aggregative entity and regards their relationship
as an external, contingent relation.3

1 74

Subjective Mind

The operation of intelligence as theoretical mind has been called cognition,
though not in the sense that intelligence cognises among other things but in addi­
tion also intuits, represents, recollects, imagines, etc. Such a position is in the first
place connected with the isolating of mental activities just criticised; but it is in
addition also connected with the great question of recent times, whether genuine
cognising, i.e. cognition of truth, is possible, with the implication that, if we see
that it is not possible, we have to abandon this endeavour. The numerous aspects,
arguments and categories with which an external reflection swells the scope of
this question get cleared up in their place; the more external the approach of the
intellect to the question, the more confused it finds a simple object. This is where
the simple concept of cognition finds its place. It confronts the entirely universal
viewpoint of that question, namely its tendency to put in question the possibil­
ity of genuine cognition in general and to present it as a possibility and option
whether we pursue cognition or neglect it. The concept of cognition has turned
out to be the intelligence itself, the cenainty of reason; the actuality of intelli­
gence is now cognition itself. It follows from this that it is absurd to speak of
intelligence and yet at the same time of the possibility or option of cognition.
Cognition is genuine, just in so far as the intelligence actualizes it, i.e. posits
the concept of cognition for itself This formal determination has its concrete
sense in the same thing as cognition does. The moments of cognition's real­
ising activity are intuition, representation, recollection, etc; these activities have
no other immanent sense; their purpose is just the concept of cognition (see §445
Remark). Only if they are isolated, is it then imagined firstly that they are use­
ful for something other than cognition, and secondly that by themselves they
provide cognitive satisfaction, leading to a glorification of the delights of intu­
ition, recollection, fantasy, etc. Of course even isolated, i.e. mindless intuition,
fantasy, etc. can provide satisfaction; what is in physical nature the fundament­
al determinacy-self-externality, exhibiting the moments of immanent reason
external to each other-can occur in the intelligence, either wilfully, or spontan­
eously, in so far as the intelligence is itself only natural, uncultivated. But true
satisfaction, one admits, is provided only by an intuition permeated by intellect
and mind, by rational representation, by productions of fantasy permeated by
reason and exhibiting Ideas, etc., i.e. by cognitive intuition, representation, etc.
The truth that is ascribed to such satisfaction lies in this: intuition, representa­
tion, etc. are not isolated, and are present only as moments of the totality, of
cognition itself. 4
Zusatz. As we have already remarked in the Zusatz to §44 1 , even the mind medi­
ated by the negation of soul and of consciousness has itself, initially, still the form
of immediacy and consequently the semblance of being external to itself, of relating,
like consciousness, to the rational as to a being outside it, onlyfound, not mediated
by mind. But by sublation of these two antecedent main stages of development,
of these presuppositions made by the mind itself, mind has already shown itself

Psychology, The Mind

175

to us as that which mediates itself with itself, as that which withdraws from its
Other into itself, as unity of the subjective and the objective. Consequently, the
activity of mind that has come to itself, that implicitly already contains the object
within itself as a sublated object, necessarily proceeds also to sublate that semb­
lance of the immediacy of itself and of its object, the form of merely finding the
object.-Accordingly intelligence's activity initially certainly appears as a form­
al, unfoljilled activity, and the mind consequently appears as unknowing; and
the very first thing to be done is to remove this unknowingness. To this end
intelligence fills itself with the object immediately given to it, which, precisely
on account of its immediacy, is burdened with all the contingency, nullity and
untruth of external reality. But intelligence, far from confining itself to merely
accepting the immediately presented content of objects, purifies the object of that
in it which shows itself to be purely external, to be contingent and null. Thus
whereas, as we have seen, it seems to consciousness that its continuing cultivation
starts from the alteration, occurring for itself, of the determinations of its object,
intelligence, by contrast, is posited as that form of mind in which the mind itself
alters the object and by the development of it also develops itself to truth. Intel­
ligence, in altering the object from external to internal, internalizes itself. These
two, the internalizing of the object and the recollection of the mind, are one and
the same thing. That of which the mind has a rational knowledge becomes a
rational content just in virtue of its being known in a rational way. Thus intelli­
gence removes the form of contingency from the object, grasps its rational nature
and so posits it as subjective; and, conversely, in this way it at the same time
cultivates subjectivity into the form of objective rationality. Thus what is at first
abstract, formal knowledge becomes concrete knowledge, filled with genuine con­
tent, hence objective knowledge. When intelligence attains this goal set for it by its
concept, it is in truth what initially it only ought to be, namely, cognition.5 Cog­
nition must surely be distinguished from mere knowledge. For even consciousness
is knowledge. But free mind does not content itself with simple knowledge; it
wants to cognize, i.e., it wants not only to know that an object is, and what it is
both overall and in its contingent, external determinations; it wants to know what
the object's determinate, substantial nature consists in. This distinction between
knowing and cognition is something entirely familiar to educated thinking. Thus
it is said, for example, that though we know that God is, cognition of him is bey­
ond us. The sense of this assertion is that while we surely have an indeterminate
representation of the abstract essence of God, we are supposed, by contrast, to be
incapable of comprehending his determinate, concrete nature. Those who speak
in this way may, as regards their own person, be perfectly right. For although
even that theology which declares God to be uncognizeable goes to a great deal
of trouble-exegetically, critically, and historically-over God and in this way
swells up into a capacious science, yet it only gets as far as a knowledge of extern­
als, and by contrast it excretes the substantial content of its object as something
indigestible for its feeble mind and accordingly forgoes cognition of God, since,

1 76

Subjective Mind

as we have said, knowledge of external determinacies does not suffice for cogni­
tion, for which a grasp of the substantial determinacy of the object is necessary.
Such a science as the one just mentioned occupies the standpoint of consciousness,
not of genuine intelligence, which used to be called, rightly, the cognitive faculty
as well, although the expression faculty has the inappropriate meaning of a mere
possibility. 6
To give a clear view of the terrain, we now schematically indicate in advance
the formal course of the development of intelligence to cognition. This is as
follows. First, intelligence has an immediate object, then, secondly, a recollected
material reflected into itself, thirdly and finally, an object subjective and object­
ive alike.
This gives rise to three stages:
cr) knowledge related to an immediately individual object, material know­
ledge, or intuition;
13) intelligence withdrawing into itselffrom the relationship to the individual­
ity of the object and relating the object to a universal, or representation;
y) intelligence comprehending the concrete universal of objects, or thinking, in
the determinate sense that what we think also is, also has objectivity.
cr) The stage of intuition, of immediate cognition, or of consciousness posited
with the determination of rationality and pervaded by the certainty ofmind,
again falls into three subdivisions:

1 . Intelligence here starts from sensation of the immediate material;
2. then it develops into attention, which both fixes on the object and
detaches it from itself; and
3. becomes in this way intuition proper, which posits the object as some­
thing external to its own self
13) The second main stage of intelligence, representation, comprises three
stages:
1 . Recollection
2. Imagination
3. Memory
y) Finally, the third main stage in this sphere, thinking, has as content:
1 . Intellect
2. judgement, and
3. Reason.?

(a) Intuition

§446
The mind as soul is naturally determined; the mind as consciousness stands in rela­
tionship to this determinacy as to an external object; but as intelligence mind

Psychology, The Mind

1 77

( 1 ) finds itselfdetermined in this way, is its sombre weaving within itself, in which
it is to itself a sort offabric and has the whole material of its knowledge. Owing
to the immediacy in which the mind thus initially occurs, it here takes only the
simple form of an individual and ordinary subjective mind, and thus appears as
feeling mind.
[Remark] When feeling occurred earlier (§399 ff.) as a mode of the soul's exist­
ence, there the finding or the immediacy has essentially the determination of
natural being or of bodiliness; but here it has just abstractly the determination
of immediacy in general.

Zusatz. We have already had on two occasions to speak offeeling, but on each
occasion in a different respect. First, we had to consider it in the case of the soul,
and more precisely at the point where the soul, awaking from its self-enclosed
natural life, finds within itself the determinations of the content of its sleeping
nature and is for th<tt very reason sentient. But by sublating the restrictedness
of sensation it attains to the feeling of its self, of its totality, and finally, appre­
hending itself as I, awakens to consciousness. At the standpoint of consciousness,
we spoke of feeling for the second time. But there the determinations of feel­
ing were the material of consciousness, separated from the soul and appearing in
the shape of an independent object. Now, thirdly and lastly, feeling has the signi­
'
ficance of being the form which mind as such, constituting the unity and truth
of soul and consciousness, initially assumes. In the mind the content of feeling is
liberated from the twofold one-sidedness which it had, on the one hand, at the
standpoint of soul and, on the other hand, at the standpoint of consciousness.
For this content now has the determination of being in itself both subjective and
objective; and mind's activity now aims only at positing the content as a unity of
the subjective and the objective. 1

§447
The form of feeling is this: a feeling is indeed a determinate affection, but this
determinacy is simple. Hence a feeling, however pure and true its content may
be, has the form of contingent particularity, besides the fact that its content can
equally well be thoroughly meagre and untrue. 1
[Remark] It is a very general presupposition that the mind has in its feeling the
material of its representations, but this statement is more usually understood in
the opposite sense to that which it has here. In contrast to the simplicity of the
feeling it is usual rather to presuppose that the judgement in general, the differ­
entiation of consciousness into a subject and object, is the original source; then
the determinacy of sentiment is derived from an independent external or internal
object. Here, in the truth of mind, this standpoint of consciousness, the oppos­
ite of the mind's idealism, has passed away, and the material of feeling has rather
been already posited as immanent in the mind.2 With regard to content it is a

1 78

Subjective Mind

common prejudice that there is more in foeling than in thinking;, this is especially
affirmed in the case of moral and religious feelings. The material, which the mind
is to itself in so far as it feels, has here too proved to be the determinedness of
reason in and for itself; hence all rational content and more precisely all mental
content too enters into feeling. But the form of selfish individuality, which the
mind has in feeling, is the lowest and worst form; in this form mind does nor
attain its freedom, its infinite universality; its substance and content remain in
a state of contingency, subjectivity, particularity. Genuine, cultivated sentiment
is the sentiment of a cultivated mind which has acquired the consciousness of
determinate distinctions, essential relationships, genuine determinations, etc; in
such a mind it is this amended material that enters into its feeling, i.e. obtains
this form. Feeling is the immediate, as it were the closest, form in which the sub­
ject relates to a given content; the subject reacts to the content first of all with its
particular self-feeling, which may well be more solid and comprehensive than a
one-sided intellectual viewpoint, but may just as easily be restricted and bad; in
any case feeling is the form of the particular and subjective. If a man on any topic
appeals not to the nature and concept of the subject-matter, or at least to reasons,
to intellectual universality, but to his foeling, the only thing to do is to let him
alone, because he thereby spurns the community of rationality, withdraws into
his isolated subjectivity, into particularity.3
Zusatz. In sentiment the whole of reason is present, the entire material of mind.
All our representations, thoughts, and concepts of external nature, oflawfulness,
of the ethical, and of the content of religion develop out of our sentient intelli­
gence; and conversely, after they have received their complete explication, they
are concentrated in the simple form of sentiment. It was, therefore, rightly said
by an ancient that men have formed their gods out of their sentiments and pas­
sions. But the way in which this development of mind from sentiment is usually
understood, implies that intelligence is originally thoroughly empty and therefore
receives all content, as entirely alien to it, from outside. This is an error. For what
the intelligence seems to receive from outside is, in truth, none other than the
rational and is consequently identical with the mind and immanent in it. The
activity of mind has, therefore, no other aim than, by sublation of the ostensible
being-external-to-its-own-self of the implicitly rational object, to refute even the
semblance of the object's externality to mind. 4

§448
(2) One of the two moments in the diremption of this immediate finding is the
abstract identical direction of the mind in feeling, as in all its other subsequent
determinations: attention, without which nothing is for the mind; -active recol­
lection, the moment of its own possession, but as the still formal self-determination
of the intelligence. The other moment is this: contraty to its own inwardness, the
intelligence posits the determinacy of feeling as a being, but as a negative, as the

Psychology, The Mind

1 79

abstract otherness of its own sel£ Intelligence hereby determines the content of
sensation as a being that is outside itself, casts it out into space and time, which are
theforms in which intelligence is intuitive. According to consciousness the mater­
ial is only an object of consciousness, a relative other; from mind it receives the
rational determination of being the other ofitself (c£ §§247, 254) . 1
Zusatz. The immediate and thus undeveloped unity, present i n sensation and feel­
ing, of mind with the object is still mindless. Therefore, intelligence sublates the
simplicity of sensation, determines what is sensed as a negative in relation to
intelligence, and thus detaches it from itself, yet at the same time posits it in its
detachment as its own. Only by this dual activity of sublating and restoring the
unity between myself and the other do I get to grasp the content of sensation.
This happens initially in attention. Without attention, therefore, no apprehen­
sion of the object is possible; only by attention does mind become present in
the subject-matter and obtain cognizance of it, though not as yet cognition of the
subject-matter, for this requires a further development of mind.2 Attention con­
stitutes, therefore, the beginning of education. But attending must be conceived
more exactly as a way of filling oneself with a content that has the determination
of being both objective and subjective, or, in other words, of not only being for
me, but also having independent being. Therefore, in attention there necessarily
occurs a separation and a unity of the subjective and the objective, a self-reflection­
into-itselfof free mind and at the same time an identical direction of mind to the
object.3 This already implies that attention is something dependent on my wil­
folness, therefore, that I am only attentive when I will to be so. 4 But it does not
follow that attention is an easy matter. On the contrary, it demands an effort,
since if a m� wants to apprehend one specific object, he must abstract from
everything else, from all the thousand and one things going round in his head,
from his other interests, even from his own person; he must suppress his own
vanity which would rashly pass j udgement on the subject-matter before it had a
chance to speak for itself, must doggedly absorb himself in the subject-matter,
must let it prevail in himself or focus on it, without obtruding his own reflections.
Attention involves, therefore, the negation ofone's own self-assertion and devoting
oneself to the subject-matter-two moments necessary for proficiency of mind,
though they are usually held to be unnecessary for so-called refined culture, since
this is supposed to imply precisely that one is finished and done with everything,
that one has got beyond everything. This aloofness leads back, in a way, to the
state ofsavagery. The savage attends to practically nothing; he lets everything pass
him by without focusing on it. Only by cultivation of the mind does attention
acquire strength and fulfilment. The botanist, for example, notices incomparably
more in a plant than one ignorant of botany does in the same time. The same is
naturally true in regard to all other objects of knowledge. A man of great discern­
ment and education has at once a complete intuition ofwhat is at issue; with him
sensation has the character of recollection throughout.s

1 80

Subjective Mind

As we have seen in the above, in attention a separation and a unity of the
subjective and the objective takes place. However, in so far as attention initially
emerges in feeling, the unity of the subjective and the objective is predominant
in it, and accordingly the difference between these two sides is still something
indeterminate. But intelligence necessarily goes on to develop this difference, to
distinguish the object from the subject in a determinate way. The first form in
which it does this is intuition. In intuition the difference between the subjective
and objective predominates, just as much as the unity of these opposed determin­
ations predominates in formal attention.6
We have now to examine here more closely the objectification of what is sensed
that occurs in intuition. In this regard we have to discuss both inner and outer
sensations.?
As regards inner sensations, it is especially true of them that in sensation man
is subject to the power of his affections, but that he eludes that power if he is
able to bring them to intuition. Thus we know, for example, that if someone
is able to convey to his intuition, say in a poem, the feelings of joy or sorrow
ovetwhelming him he detaches what is oppressing his mind from himself and
thereby procures relief or complete freedom. For although by contemplating the
many aspects of his sensations he seems to increase their power, yet he does in
fact diminish this power by making his sensations into something confronting
him, something becoming external to him. Goethe, for instance, panicularly by
his Werther, brought himself relief, whereas he subjected the readers of this novel
to the power of sentiment. The cultivated man, because he contemplates what
is sensed in all the aspects that present themselves, feels more deeply than the
uncultivated, but is at the same time superior in his mastery over feeling because
he moves especially in the element of rational thinking elevated above the narrow
confines of sensation.s
Inner sensations then are, as just indicated, more or less separable from us
according to the degree of intensity of reflective and rational thinking.
In the case of the external sensations, by contrast, the variation in their separ­
ability depends on the circumstance whether the object to which they are related
is one that persists or disappears. In accordance with this determination the five
senses range themselves in such a manner that smell and taste take their place on
the one side, while sight and feeling take up a position on the other side, with hear­
ing standing in the middle. Smell has to do with the volatilization or evaporation
of the object, taste with its consumption. Thus the object presents itself to these
two senses in its complete lack of independence, only in its material disappear­
ance. Here, therefore, intuition falls into time, and the transposition of what is
sensed from the subject into the object, is not so easy as with the sense offeeling
which is related mainly to the resistance of the object, and also with the sense prop­
er to intuition, with sight, which is concerned with the object as a predominantly
independent entity, as persisting ideally and materially and which has only an ideal
relation to it, senses only its ideal side, colour, by means of light, but leaves the

Psychology, The Mind

181

material side of the object untouched. Lastly, for hearing, the object is one that
subsists materially but vanishes ideally; in sound, the ear perceives the vibration,
i.e., the merely ideal, not real, negation of the object's independence. Therefore,
in hearing, the separability of sensation shows itself to be indeed less than in
sight, but greater than in taste and smell. We must hear sound, because sound,
detaching itself from the object, forces itself on us and we refer it without great
difficulty to this or that object because the object maintains its independence in
its vibration.9
Accordingly, the activity of intuition initially produces in general a shifting of
sensation away from us, a transformation of what is sensed into an object present
outside us. The content of sensation is not altered by this alteration; on the con­
trary, it is here still one and the same content in the mind and in the external
object, so that mind here still has no content peculiar to itself which it could corn­
pare with the content of intuition. Consequently, what comes about by intuition
is merely the transformation of the form of internality into the form of externality.
This constitutes the first way, itself still formal, in which intelligence becomes
determining. 1 0 About the significance of this externality two remarks must be
made: first, that what is sensed, in becoming an object external to the inward­
ness ofthe mind, receives the form of something external-to-itself, since the mental
or rational constitutes the objects' own nature. Secondly, we must remark that
since this transformation of what is sensed proceeds from the mind as such, what
is sensed thereby acquires a mental, i.e. an abstract externality and by this acquires
that universality which can immediately belong to the external, namely, a still
quite formal contentless universality. But the form of the concept itself falls apan
in this abstract externality. The latter therefore has the dual form of space and
of time. (Cf. §§254-259.) Sensations are thus posited spatially and temporally
by intuition. The spatial presents itself as the form of indifferent juxtaposition
and quiescent subsistence; the temporal, by contrast, presents itself as the form of
unrest, of the internally negative, of successiveness, of arising and vanishing, so that
the temporal is, in that it is not, and is not, in that it is. But the two forms of
abstract externality are identical with one another in the sense that each is utterly
discrete within itselfand at the same time utterly continuous. Their continuity,
containing within itself absolute discreteness, consists precisely in the abstract
universality of the external, a universality coming from the mind and not yet
developed to any actual individualization. 1 1
But when we said that what is sensed receives from the intuiting mind the
form of the spatial and temporal, this statement must not be understood to mean
that space and time are only subjective forms. This is what .Kant wanted to make
space and time. However, things are in truth themselves spatial and temporal; this
double form of asunderness is not one-sidedly imposed on them by our intu­
ition, it has already been originally imparted to them by the infinite mind that
is in itself, by the creative eternal Idea. When, therefore, our intuitive mind does
the deterrninations of sensation the honour of giving them the abstract form of

1 82

Subjective Mind

space and time, thereby making them into proper objects as well as assimilating
them to itself, what happens here is by no means what happens in the opinion
of subjective idealism, namely, that we receive only the subjective manner of our
determining and not the determinations belonging to the object itself. 12 Incid­
entally, we must answer those whose mental limitations lead them to attach a
quite extraordinary importance to the question of the reality of space and time:
space and time are extremely meagre and superficial determinations, therefore
things get very little from these forms, and by the loss of them, were this in fact
possible, they would thus lose very little. Cognitive thinking does not dwell on
these forms; it apprehends things in their concept, which contains space and time
within itself as something sublated. Just as in outer nature space and time, by the
dialectic of the concept immanent in them, sublate themselves into matter (§26 1 )
as their truth, so free intelligence is the dialectic o f these forms of immediate
asunderness, the dialectic that is for itself. B

§449
(3) When intelligence is this concrete unity of the two moments, and is in fact to
be immediately recollected into itself in the external being of this material and in
its recollection-into-itselfimmersed in self-externality, it is intuition. 1
Zusatz. Intuition must not be confused either with representation proper, to be
dealt with later, or with the merely phenomenological consciousness already dis­
cussed.
First of all, as regards the relationship of intuition to representation, intuition
has only this in common with representation: in both forms of mind the object is
both detached from me and at the same time my own. But that the object has the
character ofwhat is mine is present in intuition only in itself and is first posited in
representation. In intuition, the objecthood of the content predominates. Only
when I make the reflexion that it is I who have the intuition, only then do I
occupy the standpoint of representation. 2
With regard to the relationship of intuition to consciousness, the following
remark must be made. In the broadest sense of the word, one could of course
give the name of intuition to the immediate or sensory consciousness considered
in §4 1 8. But if this name is to be taken in its proper significance, as rationally it
must, then between this consciousness and intuition an essential distinction must
be drawn: the former, in unmediated, entirely abstract certainty of itself, relates
itself to the immediate individuality of the object, an individualiry disintegrating
into a multiplicity of aspects; whereas intuition is a consciousness filled by the
certainty of reason, whose object has the determination of being something
rational, consequently not an individual torn asunder into various aspects but a
totality, a cohesive follness of determinations.3 It was in this sense that Schelling
formerly spoke of intellectual intuition.4 Mindless intuition is merely sensory

Psychology, The Mind

1 83

consciousness, remaining external to the object. Mindful, genuine intuition, by
contrast, apprehends the solid substance of the object. A talented historian, for
example, has before him·in vivid intuition the whole of the conditions and events
he is to describe; by contrast, one who possesses no talent for the ponrayal of
history confines himself to individual details and overlooks the substantial. It
is, therefore, rightly insisted that in all branches of knowledge, and especially
in philosophy too, one should speak from intuition of the subject-matter. This
requires that a man enter into relationship with the subject-matter with mind,
with hean and soul, briefly in his entirety, that he stand in the centre of it and
give it free play. Only when thinking is firmly grounded in intuition of the
substance of the object can one, without deserting the truth, go on to consider
the particular which is rooted in that substance, but becomes worthless straw
when detached from it. If, however, a solid intuition of the object is lacking
from the outset or if it disappears again, then reflective thinking loses itself in the
consideration of the manifold, individualized determinations and relationships
occurring in the object, then the separating intellect tears the object apart, even
when it is a living creature, a plant or an animal, by its one-sided finite categories
of cause and effect, external end and means, etc., and in this manner, despite all
its clever ruses, fails to comprehend the concrete nature of the object, to recognize
the spiritual bond holding together all the individual details.5
But we must abandon mere intuition and the necessity for that lies in the fact
that intelligence is, by its concept, cognition, whereas intuition is not yet cognitive
knowledge, since intuition as such does not attain to the immanent development of
the substance of the object but confines itself rather to apprehending the not yet
unfolded substance still wrapped up in the inessentials of the external and contin­
gent. Intuition is, therefore, only the beginning of cognition. It is to this position
of intuition that Aristotle's saying refers, that all knowledge starts from wonder.
For since subjective reason, as intuition, has the certainty, though only the inde­
terminate certainty, of finding its own self again in the object initially burdened
with the form of unreason, the subject-matter instils into it wonder and awe.
But philosophical thinking must rise above the standpoint of wonder. It is quite
erroneous to suppose that one already genuinely knows the subject-matter when
one has an immediate intuition of it. Complete cognition belongs only to the pure
thinking of conceptual reason, and only someone who has risen to this thinking
possesses a perfectly determinate, genuine intuition. With him intuition con­
stitutes only the solid form into which his completely developed cognition is
concentrated again. In immediate intuition, I do indeed have the entire mat­
ter before me; but only in the cognition that is unfolded in all its aspects and
returns to the form of simple intuition does the matter stand before my mind as
an internally articulated, systematic totality. In general, only the educated man has
an intuition freed from the mass of contingencies and equipped with a wealth of
rationality. A sensible, educated man can, even though he does not philosophize,

1 84

Subjective Mind

grasp the essentials, the core, of the matter in simple determinacy. Contemplative
thinking is, however, always necessary for this. People often imagine that the poet,
like the artist in general, must operate purely intuitively. This is not the case at all .
On the contrary, a genuine poet, before and during the execution of his work,
must meditate and think contemplatively; only in this way can he hope to extricate
the heart or the soul of the matter from all the externalities in which it is shrouded
and by so doing, develop his intuition organically. 6

§450
Just as essentially, intelligence directs its attention at and against its own self­
externality, and in its immediacy it is the awakening to itself, its recollection into
itself in this immediacy. Thus intuition is this concretion of the material and
the intelligence, the intelligence's own possession, so that it no longer needs this
immediacy and the finding of the content. 1
Zusatz. At the standpoint of mere intuition we are outside ourselves, in spatiality
and temporality, these two forms of asunderness. Here intelligence is immersed in
the external material, is one with it, and has no other content than that of the
intuited object. Therefore, in intuition we can become extremely unftee. But, as
we already remarked in the Zusatz to §448, intelligence is the dialectic of this
immediate asunderness, a dialectic that is for itself Accordingly, mind posits the
intuition as its own, pervades it, makes it into something internal, recollects itself
in it, becomes present to itself in it, and hence .free. By this withdrawal into itself,
intelligence raises itself to the stage of representation.2 Representational mind has
intuition; intuition is sublated in mind, not vanished, not merely passed away.
Therefore, when we talk about an intuition sublated to representation, language
too is quite correct in saying: I have seen this. By this is expressed no mere past,
but presence as well; here the past is a merely relative past, -it resides only in the
comparison ofimmediate intuition with what we now have in representation. But
the word 'have', used in the perfect tense, has quite literally the meaning of pres­
ence: what I have seen is something that I not merely had, but still have, - thus
something present in me. In this use of the word 'have' can be seen a universal
sign of the inwardness of the modern mind, which does not merely reflect on the
fact that the past in its immediacy has passed away, but also on the fact that in the
mind the past is still preserved. 3

(�) Representation
§451
Representation is the recollected intuition and, as such, is the mean
between intelligence's immediate finding-itself-determined and intelligence in
its freedom, thinking. The representation is intelligence's own possession still

Psychology, The Mind

1 85

with one-sided subjectivity, since this possession is not self-contained being, but
still conditioned by immediacy. ' The path of intelligence in representations is
to make the immediacy inward, to posit itself intuitively within itself, j ust as it
is to sublate the subjectivity of the inwardness, and within inwardness itself to
divest itself of it and to be within itselfin its own externality. 2 But as representing
begins from the intuition and the ready-found material of intuition, this activity
is still burdened with this difference, and its concrete productions within it are
still syntheses, which become the concrete immanence of the concept only in
thinking.3

Zusatz. The various forms of the mind as it occupies the standpoint of repres­
entation tend to be regarded, even more than is the case with the preceding
stage of intelligence, as individualized, mutually independent powers or faculties.
Besides the faculty of representation in general, one speaks of power of imagina­
tion and of power of memory, treating the mutual independence of these forms
of mind as a foregone conclusion. But the genuinely philosophical conception
of these forms just consists in comprehending the rational connection obtaining
between them, in recognizing the organic development of intelligence occurring
in them.4
To facilitate a survey of the stages of this development, we now propose to
indicate them here in advance in a general way.
(1) The first of these stages we call recollection in the peculiar sense of the
word according to which it consists in the involuntary arousal of a content that is
already ours. Recollection forms the most abstract stage of the intelligence at work
in representations. Here the represented content is still the same as in intuition;
in intuition it receives its verification, just as, conversely, the content of intuition
proves its worth in my representation. We have, consequently, at this stage a con­
tent which is not only intuited as it just is, but at the same time recollected, posited
as mine. Determined in this way, the content is what we call an image. 5
(2) The second stage in this sphere is the imagination. Here there enters the
opposition between my subjective or represented content and the intuited content
of the subject-matter. The imagination fashions for itself a content peculiar to it
by reacting to the intuited object thinkingly, by bringing out what is universal
in it, and giving it determinations that pertain to the I. In this way the imagin­
ation ceases to be merely formal recollection and becomes the recollection that
affects the content, universalizes it, thus creating universal representations. Since
at this stage the opposition of the subjective and objective prevails, the unity of
these determinations here car�not be an immediate unity, as at the stage of mere
recollection, but only a restored unity. The manner in which this restoration takes
place is this: the intuited external content is subjugated to the represented con­
tent which has been raised to universality, is reduced to a sign of the represented
content, while the represented content is in this way made objective, external, is
rendered imageable.6

1 86

Subjective Mind

(3) Memory is the third stage of representation. Here, on the one hand, the
sign is recollected, taken up into the intelligence; on the other hand, the intelli­
gence is thereby given the form of something external, mechanical, and in this way
a unity of the subjective and objective is produced which forms the transition to
thinking as such. 7
{1) Recollection

§452
Intelligence, in first recollecting the intuition, puts the content offeeling in its
inwardness, in its own space and its own time. In this way the content is (crcr) an
image, liberated from its initial immediacy and abstract individuality in contrast
to other things, as received into the universality of the I in general. The image no
longer has the complete determinacy that the intuition has, and is wilful or con­
tingent, in general isolated from the external place, the time, and the immediate
context in which the intuition stood. 1
Zusatz. Since intelligence is, by its concept, the infinite ideality o r universality
that is for itself, the space and the time of intelligence are universal space and
universal time. Consequently, in placing the content of feeling in the inward­
ness of intelligence and thereby making it a representation, I lift the content out
of the particularity of space and time, the particularity to which the content, in
its immediacy, is bound and on which I too am dependent in sensation and
intuition. From this it follows, first, that whereas the immediate presence of the
thing is necessary for sensation and intuition, I can by contrast represent something
to myself wherever I am , even what is remotest from me in external space and
external time.2 Secondly, it follows from what we said above that everything that
happens acquires duration for us only when it is taken up into representational
intelligence, whereas occurrences not regarded by the intelligence as worth tak­
ing up in this way become something entirely past. However, what is represented
gains this immortality only at the cost of the clarity and freshness of the immedi­
ate individuality, the all round determinacy, of what is intuited; the intuition is
obscured and blurred, when it becomes an image.3
As regards time, a further remark can be made concerning the subjective char­
act.e�,; it acquires in representation. In intuition time becomes short for us when
we have much to intuit, but long, when a deficiency of given material drives us to
the contemplation of our empty subjectivity. In representation it is the other way
round: those times in which we were occupied in various ways strike us as long,
whereas those times in which we had little to do seem to be short. Here, in recollec­
tion, we keep our subjectivity, our inwardness, in view and determine the measure
of the time by the interest that we took in it. In the former case, in intuition, we
are immersed in contemplation of the thing; here time appears short to us when
it is filled with an ever changing content, but long when nothing interrupts its
uniformity.4

Psychology, The Mind

§453
(��) The image for itself is transient, and the intelligence itself, as attention, is
its time and also its space, its when and where. But intelligence is not only con­
sciousness and reality, but as intelligence it is the subject and the in-itselfof its
own determinations; recollected within intelligence, the image, no longer existing,
is preseroed unconsciously. 1
[Remark] To conceive intelligence as this nocturnal pit in which is stored a world
of infinitely many images and representations, yet without being in conscious­
ness, is on the one hand the universal requirement to conceive the concept as
concrete, as we conceive e.g. the seed as affirmatively containing, in virtual pos­
sibility, all the determinacies that come into existence only in the development of
the tree. Inability to conceive this intrinsically concrete and yet steadfastly simple
universal is what occasioned the talk about the preservation of particular repres­
entations in particular fibres and areas; diverse items are supposed essentially to
have only an individualized spatial existence too.2-But the seed comes out of
the existing d�terminacies and returns to its simplicity, to the existence of being­
ill-itself again, only in something else, in the seed of the fruit. But intelligence as
such is the free existence of the being-in-itselfthat recollects itself into itself in its
development.3 Hence intelligence is to be conceived, on the other hand, as this
unconscious pit, i.e. as the existing universal in which what is diverse is not yet
posited as discrete. And in fact this in-itselfis the first form of universality that
presents itself in representation.4
Zusatz. The image is mine, it belongs to me; but initially it has no further homo­
geneity with me, for it is not yet thought, not yet raised to the form ofrationality.
On the contrary, between it and myself there still subsists a relationship not genu­
inely free, stemming from the standpoint of intuition, a relationship in which I
am only internal, and the image is what is external to me. Therefore initially I do
not yet have full power over the images slumbering in the depths of my inward­
ness, I am not yet able to summon them up again at will. No one knows what an
infinite host of images of the past slumbers in him; now and then they do indeed
awake by chance, but one cannot, as we say, call them to mind. Thus the images
are ours only in aformal manner. s
·

§454
(yy) Such an abstractly stored image needs, for its reality, a real intuition; authen­
tic recollection, as it is called, is the relation of the image to an intuition, in fact
the subsumption of the immediate individual intuition under what is universal in
form, under the representation which is the same content. Thus the intelligence is
still internal to itself in the determinate sensation and its intuition and recognizes
them as what is already its own, just as at the same time it is now aware of its ini­
tially only internal image as also an immediate image of intuition and as proved

1 88

Subjective Mind

in intuition. l -The image, which in the pit of intelligence was only its property,
is now, with the determination of externality, also in its possession. The image is
thereby posited both as distinguishable from the intuition and as separable from
the simple night in which it is initially submerged. Intelligence is thus the power
which can externalize its property and which no longer needs external intuition
for the existence of the property in intelligence. 2 This synthesis of the internal
image with the recollected reality is representation proper, since what is intern­
al now also comprises the determination of being able to be presented before the
intelligence, ofhaving reality in intelligence.3

Zusatz. The images of the past lying hidden in the dark depths of our interior
become our actual possession in the following way. They present themselves to
the intelligence in the luminous, plastic shape of an occurrent intuition of the
same content, and with the help of this present intuition we recognize them as
intuitions we have already had. Thus it happens, for example, that we recognize
out of hundreds of thousands someone whose image has already become quite
dim in our mind, as soon as we catch sight of him again. If, therefore, I am to
retain something in recollection, I must have repeated the intuition of it. To begin
with, the image will of course be aroused not so much by myself as by the cor­
responding immediate intuition. But the image, by being frequently summoned
up in this way, acquires such a great vitality and presence in me that I no longer
need the external intuition in order to recollect it. In this way children pass from
intuition to recollection. The more cultivated a man is, the more he lives not in
immediate intuition, but, in all his intuitions, at the same time in recollections;
so that he sees little that is altogether new but, on the contrary, the substantial
content of most of what is new is something already familiar to him. Similarly,
a cultivated man contents himself for the most part with his images and seldom
feels the need of immediate intuition. The inquisitive multitude, by contrast, are
always hurrying to where there is something to gape at.4

(2) Imagination

§455
(aa) When it is at work in this possession intelligence is the reproductive imagin­
ation, the emergence of images from the I's own inwardness; the I is from now
on the power over them. The nearest relation of the images is the relation of
their external, immediate space and time, which are stored up with them. 1 - But
in the subject, in which it is stored up, the image has only the individualiry in
which the determinations of its content are linked together; its immediate con­
cretion, by contrast, i.e. the initially only spatial and temporal concretion, which
it has as a unit in intuition, is dissolved. 2 The content reproduced, belonging as
it does to the self-identical unity of intelligence and sent out from its universal
pit, has a universal representation for the associating relation of the images, of the

Psychology, The Mind

1 89

representations which, according to former circumstances, are more abstract or
more concrete.3
[Remark] The so-called laws of the association of Ideas have commanded great
interest, especially during the blossoming of empirical psychology that coincided
with the decline of philosophy.4 For one thing, it is not Ideas that are associated.5
For another, these modes of relation a_re not laws, just for the reason that there
are so many laws about the same thing, making way rather for wilfulness and con­
tingency, the opposite of a law; it is a contingent matter whether the connecting
link is something pictorial, or an intellectual category, likeness and unlikeness,
ground and consequent, etc.6 Progression through images and representations in
the wake of the associative imagination is in general the play of a thoughtless rep­
resenting, where the determination of intelligence is still formal universality in
general, but the content is the content given in the images.?-Image and rep­
resentation, if we ignore the more precise determination we have given in terms
of their form, are distinguished in their content by the fact that the image is the
more sensorily concrete representation; representation (whether the content be
something pictorial or concept and Idea) has in general the character, though
belonging to intelligence, of being in respect of its content something given and
immediate. The being, the finding-itself-determined, of intelligence still adheres to
representation, and the universality which representing confers on that material is
still abstract universality. 8 The representation is the middle term in the syllogism
of the ascent of intelligence, the link between the two meanin!§5 ofrelation-to-self,
namely being and universality, which in consciousness are determined as object
and subject. Intelligence supplements what is found with the meaning of univer­
sality, and supplements what is its own, the inner, with the meaning of being,
but a being posited by itself.9-0n the distinction between representations and
thoughts, cf. Introduction, §20 Remark.
The abstraction that occurs in the representing activity by which universal rep­
resentations are produced (and representations as such already have the form of
universality in them) , is frequently expressed as a superimposition of many similar
images upon one another and is supposed in this way to become comprehensible.
If this superimposing is not to be entirely a matter of chance, with no trace of a
concept, a force ofattraction between similar images must be assumed, or some­
thing of the sort, which at the same time would be the negative power of rubbing
off their remaining unlikeness against each other. This force is in fact intelligence
itself, the self-identical I which by its recollection immediately gives the images
universality, and subsumes the individual intuition under the already internalized
image (§453) . 10

Zusatz. The second stage of development of representation is, as we have already
indicated in the Zusatz to §45 1 , the imagination. The first form of representing,
recollection, ascends to imagination in this way: emerging from its abstract being­
within-itself into determinacy, the intelligence disperses the nocturnal darkness

1 90

Subjective Mind

enveloping the wealth of its images and dispels it by the luminous clarity of
presence.
But imagination, in irs turn, contains three forms in which it unfolds. It is, in
general, the determinant of images.
At first, however, it does no more than determine the entry of images into real­
ity. Here it is only reproductive imagination. This has the character of a merely
formal activity. But, secondly, imagination does not merely summon up again
the images present in it but relates them to each other and in this way raises them
to universal representations. Accordingly, at this stage, imagination appears as
the activity of associating images. The third stage in this sphere is the stage at
which intelligence identifies its universal representations with the particularity
of the image and so gives them a pictorial reality. This sensory reality has the
double form of symbol and sign, so that this third stage comprises the symbol­
ising and the sign-making fantasy, the latter of which constitutes the transition to
memory. I I
Reproductive Imagination. S o the first thing is the formal process of reprodu­
cing images. It is true that pure thoughts can also be reproduced; imagination
has to do not with them, however, but only with images. But the reproduction
of images on the part of imagination occurs voluntarily and without the help of
an immediate intuition. This is what distinguishes this form of representation­
al intelligence from mere recollection, which does not operate spontaneously but
requires a present intuition and lers the images emerge involuntarily. 12
Associative Imagination. A higher activity than mere reproducing is the relating
of images to one another. The content of the images has, on account of irs imme­
diacy or sensoriness, the form ofJinitude, of relation to an Other. Now since here
it is I who determine or posit in general, I also posit this relation. By this relation
intelligence gives the images a subjective bond instead of their objective bond. But
this subjective bond still has in part the shape of externality with respect to what is
connected by it. For example, I have before me the image of an object; this image
is connected quite externally to the image of persons with whom I have spoken
about this object, or who possess it, etc. Often the images are linked together only
by space and time. Ordinary social conversation mostly weaves its way from one
idea to another in a very external and contingent manner. It is only when the
discussion has a definite aim that it acquires a firmer coherence. l 3 The various
emotional moods give all representations a peculiar relation-cheerful moods
give a cheerful relation, sad moods a sad relation. This is even more true of pas­
sions. The degree of intelligence also produces a difference in the way images are
related; clever, witty people are therefore different from ordinary people in this
respect too; someone clever seeks out images that contain something solid and
profound. Wit combines ideas which, although remote from one another, never­
theless have in fact an inner connection. Punning, too, is to be included in this
sphere; the deepest passion can resort to word-play; for a great mind, even in the

Psychology, The Mind

191

most unfonunate circumstances, knows how to bring everything it encounters
into relation with its passion. 14

§456
Hence even the association of representations is to be conceived as subsumption of
the individual representations under a universal representation, which forms the
connection between them.1 But intelligence is not only universal form in them;
its inwardness is intrinsically determinate, concrete subjectivity with content of its
own, which derives from some interest, some concept or Idea that is in itself, in
so far as we may in anticipation speak of such content. Intelligence is the power
over the stock of images and representations belonging to it, and thus (��) freely
combines and subsumes this stock under its own peculiar content. Thus in this
stock of ideas intelligence is recollected determinately into itself and imaginatively
impresses the stock on its own content: -fantasy, symbolizing, allegorizing or cre­
ative imagination. These more or less concrete, individualized structures are still
syntheses, in so far as the material, in which the subjective content acquires a
reality of representation, derives from what is found in intuition.2
Zusatz. Images are already more universal than intuitions; they still have, however,
a sensory-concrete content whose relation to another such content is I myself. But
now when I turn my attention to this relation, I arrive at universal representa­
tions, or at representations in the strict sense of this word. For what enables the
individual images to relate to one another consists precisely in what is common to
them. This common element is either some particular aspect of the object raised
to the form of universality, such as, for example, the red colour in the rose, or
the concrete universal, the genus, for example, the plant in the rose,- but in each
case a representation that comes about through the dissolution, proceeding from
the intelligence, of the empirical connection of the manifold determinations of
the object. In the production of universal representations, the intelligence thus
operates spontaneously, it is, therefore, an inept mistake to assume that universal
representations arose, without any help from the mind, by the superimposition
of many similar images, that, for example, the red colour of the rose picked up
the red of other images situated in my head, and thus conveyed to me, a mere
spectator, the universal representation of red. Of course, the panicular element
belonging to the image is something given; but the analysis of the concrete indi­
viduality of the image and the resultant form of universality come, as remarked,
from myself.3
Abstract representations, to mention these in passing, are often called concepts.
The philosophy of Fries consists essentially of such representations. When it is
assened that this son of thing leads one to knowledge of the truth, the rejoinder
must be that it does just the opposite, and that therefore someone with any sense
holds on to concrete images and rightly rejects such empty scholastic wisdom.

1 92

Subjective Mind

But there is no need here to labour this point.4 No more are we concerned here
with the precise nature of the content, whether this comes from the external world
or from the sphere of reason, of law, ethics, and religion. The question at issue here
is only the universality of the representation in general. From this point of view we
have the following remark to make.
In the subjective sphere, which we now occupy, the universal representation
is the internal, whereas the image is the external. These two mutually opposed
determinations initially still fall apart, but in their separation each is one-sided.
The representation lacks externality, pictorial vivacity, the image forgoes eleva­
tion to the expression of a determinate universal. The truth of these two sides is,
therefore, their unity. More exactly, this unity, the imaging of the universal and
the universalization ofthe image, comes about in the following way. The universal
representation does not unite with the image to form a neutral, so to speak, chem­
ical product. It actively proves itself to be the substantial power over the image,
subjugating it as an accident of itself, making itself into the soul of the image; in
the image it becomes for itself, recollects itself, manifests its own self. When the
intelligence produces this unity of the universal and the particular, of the internal
and the external, of representation and intuition, and in this way restores the total­
ity present in intuition as a proven totality, the representational activity becomes
complete within itself, in so far as it is productive imagination. This constitutes the
formal aspect of art; for art displays the genuine universal or the Idea in the form
of sensory reality, of the image. 5

§457
In fantasy intelligence has been perfected to self-intuition within itself, inasmuch
as its content, derived from its own self, has pictorial existence. This structure of
its self-intuiting is subjective; the moment of what is is still lacking. But in the
structure's unity of the inner content and the material, intelligence has likewise
implicitly returned to identical self-relation as immediacy. As reason, intelligence
starts by appropriating what is immediately found within itself (§445, c£ §455
Remark), i.e. by determining it as a universal; correspondingly its activity as reas­
on (§438) is, from the present point on, to determine as a being what within it
has been perfected to concrete self-intuition, i.e. to make itself into being, into
the thing. When active in this determination, it is self-externalising, intuition­
producing: ( yy) sign-makingfontasy. 1
[Remark] Fantasy is the midpoint in which the universal and being, one's own
and being-found, the inner and outer, are completely welded into one. The
preceding syntheses of intuition, recollection, etc., are unifications of the same
moments; but they are syntheses; only in fantasy does intelligence present itself
not as the indeterminate pit and the universal, but as individuality, i.e. as
concrete subjectivity, in which the self-relation is determined to being as well
as to universality.2 The structures of fantasy are everywhere recognized as such

Psychology, The Mind

1 93

unifications of what is the mind's own or its interior with the intuitive; their more
determinate content belongs to different departments. Here we are to conceive of
this inner workshop only in terms of these abstract moments.3-As the activity
of this unification, fantasy is reason, but only formal reason, in so far as the
content of fantasy as such is a matter of indifference; whereas reason as such also
determines the content to truth.4
Another point calling for special emphasis is this. Fantasy brings the inner
content to the image and to intuition, and this is expressed by saying that it
determines the content as being. So we must not find this expression surprising
either, that intelligence makes itself be, makes itself the thing; for the content of
intelligence is intelligence itself, and so is the determination that it gives to this
content.5 The image produced by fantasy is only subjectively intuitive; in the sign
it adds intuitability proper; in mechanical memory it completes, inside itself, this
form of being. 6

Zusatz. As we have seen in the Zusatz to the previous Paragraph, in fantasy
the universal representation constitutes the subjective element which gives itself
objectivity in the image and thereby proves itself. This proof is, however, itself
immediately still a subjective proof, in so far as intelligence initially still has
regard to the given content of the images, is guided by it in imaging its universal
representations. This activity of intelligence, which is in this way still conditioned,
only relatively free, we call symbolizing fantasy. Symbolizing fantasy selects for
the expression of its universal representations only that sensory material whose
independent meaning corresponds to the determinate content of the universal
to be imaged. Thus, for example, the strength of Jupiter is displayed by the
eagle because this is regarded as being strong. -Allegory expresses the subjective
element more by an ensemble of individual details. - Finally, po!?tic fantasy does
indeed use material more freely than the plastic arts; yet it too may only select
such sensory material as is adequate to the content of the Idea to be exhibited. 7
But intelligence necessarily progresses from the subjective proof present in the
symbol and mediated by the image, to the objective proof of the universal repres­
entation, a proof that is in and for itself For since the content of the universal
representation to be proved joins together only with itself in the content of the
image serving as a symbol, this mediated form of the proof, of this unity of the
subjective and objective, turns into the form of immediacy. By this dialectic­
al movement, the universal representation reaches the point where it no longer
needs the content of the image for its proof, but is proved in and for its own self,
is, therefore, immediately valid. Now the universal representation, liberated from
the content of the image, makes itself into something intuitable in an extern­
al material wilfolly chosen by itself, and thus produces what has to be called,
in definite contrast to the symbol, a sign. The sign must be proclaimed a great
accomplishment. When the intelligence has designated something, then it has
finished with the content of intuition and has given the sensory material an alien

1 94

Subjective Mind

meaning as its soul. So for example, a cockade or a flag or a tomb-stone means
something entirely different from what it immediately indicates. The wilfulness,
emerging here, of the combination of the sensory material with a universal repres­
entation has the necessary consequence that the meaning of the sign must first be
learned. This is especially true of linguistic signs. 8

§458
In this uniry, stemming from intelligence, of an independent representation and
an intuition, the matter of the intuition is of course initially something received,
something immediate or given (e.g. the colour of the cockade, etc.). But in this
identity the intuition does not count as positive or as representing itself, but as
representing something else. It is an image that has received into itself as its soul
an independent representation of the intelligence, its meaning. This intuition is
the sign . 1
[Remark] The sign is some immediate intuition, which represents a wholly dif­
ferent content from the content that it has for itself; - the pyramid into which
an alien soul is transferred and preserved. The sign is different from the symbol,
from an intuition whose own determinacy is, in its essence and concept, more or
less the content which it expresses as symbol; in the sign as such, by contrast, the
intuition's own content and the content of which it is a sign, have nothing to do
with each other. In signifYing therefore intelligence displays a freer wilfulness and
mastery in the use of intuition than in symbolizing. 2
In psychology or even in logic the sign and language are usually fitted in some­
where as an appendix, with no thought of their necessity and connections in
the system of the activity of intelligence. The right place for the sign is the one
indicated: intelligence-which in intuiting generates the form of time and of
space, but appears as the recipient of the sensory content and as forming its rep­
resentations out of this material-now gives its independent representations a
determinate reality out of itself, uses the filled space and time, the intuition, as
its own, deletes its immediate and peculiar content, and gives it another content
as its meaning and soul.3-This sign-creating activity may be especially named
productive memory (the initially abstract mnemosyne); since memory, which in
ordinary life is often confused with recollection and used synonymously with it,
even with representation and imagination, has in general to do with signs only. 4

§459
The intuition, which in its immediacy is initially something given and spatial,
acquires, in so far as it is used as a sign, the essential determination of occurring
only as sublated. Intelligence is this intrinsic negativity; thus the more appro­
priate shape of the intuition that is a sign is a reality in time, -a disappearance
of the reality as soon as it is, and, in its further external psychical determinacy,

Psychology, The Mind

a positedness by intelligence, emerging from its own (anthropological) natural­
ness, - the sound, the fulfilled externalization of self-announcing inwardness. 1
Sound articulating itself further for determinate representations, speech, and its
system, language, give to sensations, intuitions, representations a second, higher
reality than their immediate one, in general an existence that carries weight in the
realm ofrepresentation. 2
[Remark] Language here comes into consideration only in the specific determ­
inacy of being the product of intelligence for manifesting its representations in
an external element. If we were to deal with language a concrete way, we would
have to revert to the anthropological, more precisely the psycho-physiological
standpoint (§401) for the material of language (the lexical element), and to anti­
cipate the standpoint of the intellect for the form (grammar) . For the element­
ary material of language, the idea of mere contingency has disappeared, while
on the other hand the principle of imitation has been restricted to its narrow
range, objects that make a sound. Yet one can still hear the German language
praised for its wealth on account of the many particular expressions it possesses
for particular sounds. (Rauschen, Sausen, Knarren, etc.; perhaps more than a hun­
dred of them have been collected; the whim of the moment creates new ones
when it pleases.) Such an abundance in the sensory and insignificant contrib­
utes nothing to the wealth of a cultivated language. The specifically elementary
material itself depends less on a symbolism relating to external objects than on
inner symbolism, namely anthropological articulation, as it were a gesture of the
bodily expression of speech. For each vowel and consonant, as well as for their
more abstract elements (gesture of lips, of palate, of tongue) and then for their
combinations, people have thus looked for the specific meaning. But these dull
subconscious beginnings are modified to inconspicuousness and insignificance,
by further external factors or by the needs of civilisation, but essentially by the
reduction of what are themselves sensory intuitions to signs, · so that their own
original meaning atrophies and is extinguished. 3 Bur the formal element of lan­
guage is the work of the intellect which impresses its categories on language; this
logical instinct gives rise to the grammar of language. The study oflanguages still
in their original state, which we have first begun to get to know thoroughly in
recent times, has shown on this point that they involve a highly elaborate and
detailed grammar and express distinctions which are lacking or have been obliter­
ated in the languages of more civilised peoples. It seems that the language of the
most civilised peoples has the less complete grammar, and the same language has
a more complete grammar when the people is in a more uncivilised state than in a
more highly civilised state. Cf. Mr W. von Humboldt's On the Dual, 1 , 1 0, 1 1 .4
While on the subject of spoken language (which is the original language), we
can also mention, but here only in passing, written language; this is merely a fur­
ther development within the particular province of language which enlists the
help of an externally practical activiry.s Written language proceeds to the field of

1 96

Subjective Mind

immediate spatial intuition, in which it takes and produces signs (§454) . More
precisely, hieroglyphic script designates representations with spatial figures, whereas
alphabetic script designates sounds which are themselves already signs. Alphabet­
ical writing thus consists of signs of signs, and in such a way that it analyses
the concrete signs of spoken language, words, into their simple elements and
designates these elements.6-Leibniz allowed himself to be misled by his intel­
lect into believing that a complete written language, formed in a hieroglyphic
manner-which occurs in a panial way even in alphabetic writing (as in our
signs for numbers, the planets, the chemical substances, etc.) -would be very
desirable as a universal written language for the communication of peoples and
especially of scholars.? But it may be thought that it was rather the commu­
nication of peoples (as was probably the case in Phoenicia, and today happens
in Canton-see Macartney's Travels by Staunton) which occasioned the need of
alphabetical writing and led to its emergence.8 Anyway a comprehensive, finished
hieroglyphic language is out of the question. Sensory objects no doubt admit of
permanent signs, but for signs of spiritual matters the progress in the cultiva­
tion of our thoughts, the advance of logical development, lead to altered views
of their internal relationships and thus of their nature, so that with this anoth­
er hieroglyphic determination would also emerge. After all, this already happens
with sensory objects: their signs in spoken language, their names, are frequently
changed, as e.g. with chemical and mineralogical names. Ever since we have for­
gotten what nariies, as such, are, namely intrinsically senseless externalities which
only have a meaning as signs, ever since we require, instead of genuine names, the
expression of a sort of definition and in fact frequently also form the definition
again according to choice and chance, the denomination, i.e. just the combin­
ation of signs of their generic determination or other supposedly characteristic
properties, is altered according to the different views we take of the genus or of
any other supposedly specific property.9-lt is only a stationary spiritual culture,
like the Chinese, which is suited by the hieroglyphic script of that people; in any
case only that lesser portion of a people which remains in exclusive possession of
spiritual culture can share in this type of written language. 10-At the same time,
the development of spoken language is very closely connected with the habit of
alphabetic writing, which is the only way in which spoken language acquires
the determinacy and purity of its articulation. The imperfection of the Chinese
spoken language is well-known; a mass of its words have several utterly different
meanings, as many as ten, or even rwenty, so that, in speaking, the distinction is
made noticeable merely by stress and intensity, by speaking more softly or cry­
ing out. Europeans beginning to speak Chinese stumble into the most ridiculous
misunderstandings before they have mastered these absurd refinements of accen­
tuation. Perfection here consists in the opposite of that parler sans accent which in
Europe is rightly required for cultivated speech. Owing to hieroglyphic written

Psychology, The Mind

1 97

language the Chinese spoken language lacks the objective determinacy that is
gained in articulation from alphabetic writing. 1 1
Alphabetic writing is in and for itself the more intelligent form; i n i t the word,
the worthiest mode, peculiar to the intelligence, of expressing its representations,
is brought to consciousness and made an object of reflexion. In this preoccupa­
tion of intelligence with the word, the word is analysed, i.e. this sign-making
is reduced to its few simple elements (the primal gestures of articulation); these
are the sensory component of speech, brought to the form of universaliry, and
at the same time acquiring in this elementary manner complete determinacy
and purity. 12 Alphabetic writing thereby also retains the advantage of spoken
language, that in written as in spoken language representations have genuine
names; the name is the simple sign for the genuine, i.e. simple representation, not
resolved into its determinations and compounded out of them. Hieroglyphic lan­
guage arises not from the direct analysis of sensory signs, like alphabetic writing,
but from the preliminary analysis of representations. This then readily provokes
the thought that all representations could be reduced to their elements, to simple
logical determinations, so that from the elementary signs chosen for these (as, in
the case of the Chinese kua, the simple straight stroke, and the stroke broken into
two parts) hieroglyphic language would be generated by their composition. l3
This circumstance, the analytical designation of representations in hieroglyphic
script, which misled Leibniz into regarding it as preferable to alphabetic writing,
is rather what contradicts the fundamental need oflanguage in general, the name,
to have for the immediate representation (which, whatever riches may be com­
prehended in its intrinsic content, is for the mind simple in the name) a simple
immediate sign as well, which as a being for itself provokes no thought, having
only the determination of sensorily representing and meaning the simple repres­
entation as such. It is not only the representing intelligence that dwells on the
simplicity of representations and also puts them together again from the more
abstract moments into which they have been analysed; thinking too reunifies the
concrete content into the form of a simple thought after the analysis in which it
has become a combination of many determinations. Both intelligence and think­
ing need to have such signs, simple in respect of their meaning, signs which,
though consisting of several letters or syllables and even decomposed into them,
yet do not display a combination of several representations.14-The foregoing
considerations constitute the principle for deciding on the value of written lan­
guages. Then too it emerges that in hieroglyphic script the relations of concrete
spiritual representations must necessarily become complicated and confused, and
in any case the analysis of them (the immediate products of which are also to be
analysed in turn) appears to be possible in the most various and divergent ways.
Every divergence in analysis would give rise to a different formation of the writ­
ten name; just as in recent times (as we have already noted) even in the sensory
sphere hydrochloric acid has undergone several changes of name. A hieroglyphic

Subjective Mind

198

written language would require a philosophy as stationary as is the civilisation of
the Chinese overall.IS
It also follows from what has been said that learning to read and write an
alphabetic script is to be regarded as an inestimable and not sufficiently appre­
ciated educational instrument, in that it diverts the mind's attention from the
sensorily concrete to the more formal aspect, the spoken word and its abstract
elements, and makes an essential contribution to laying and clearing the ground
for the subject's inwardness.16-Later too, ingrained habit effaces the peculi­
arity of alphabetic writing, that it appears to take, in the interest of vision,
a roundabout route to representations by way of audibility; habit makes it a
hieroglyphic script for us, so that in using it we need not have the medi­
ation of the sounds before our consciousness, whereas people who are little
accustomed to reading speak aloud what they read in order to understand
it in its sound. Besides the fact that with the facility that transforms alpha­
betic script into hieroglyphics the ability in abstraction gained by the initial
practice remains, hieroglyphic reading is for itself a deaf reading and a dumb
writing; it is true that the audible or temporal and the visible or spatial each
has its own foundation, initially of equal validity with the other; but in the
case

of alphabetic script there is only

one

foundation, and in fact it stands

in the correct relationship: the visible language is related to the audible only
as a sign; the intelligence expresses itself immediately and unconditionally by
speakingP-The mediation of representations by the less sensory element,
sounds, also shows its peculiar essentiality for the transition that follows, from
representation to thinking,-memory.IS

ing the intuition of the word, that intelligence, as representation in general, runs
through regarding the first immediate intuition

(§§451 ff.).1-aa

Intelligence

takes the connection, which the sign is, into its possession, and by this recollec­
tion elevates the

individual connection to a universal, i.e. permanent, connection,

in which name and meaning are for it objectively combined, and makes the intu­

one representation, and the representing

ition, which the name initially is, into a
meaning, and the sign are identified, are

1 99

in its inwardness is concrete, with the content as its reality: the memory that
retains names.z
Zusatz. We consider memory in three forms: first, name-retaining memory;
second, reproductive memory; third, mechanical memory.
The first thing here, then, is this: we retain the meaning of names, we acquire
the capacity, in the case of linguistic signs, of recollecting the representations
objectively linked with them. Thus when we hear or see a word belonging to a
foreign language, its meaning presents itself to us; but it does not follow that the
converse is true, that we can yet come up with the corresponding word-signs for
our representations in that language. We learn to speak and write a language later
than we understand it.3

§462
The name is thus the thing, as the thing is available and carries weight in the
realm of representation. ��) Reproductive memory has and recognises the thing
in the name, and with the thing it has the name, without intuition and image.
The name, as existence of the content within the intelligence, is the externality of
intelligence itself within itself; and the recollection of the name as the intuition
produced by intelligence is at the same time the self-externalization in which intel­
ligence posits itself inside itsel£ 1 The association of the particular names lies in
the meaning of the determinations of the sensing, representing, or thinking intel­
ligence; the intelligence traverses series of these determinations within itself as it
senses, etc. 2
[Remark] Given the name lion, we need neither the intuition of such an animal,
nor even its image; the name, when we understand it, is the simple image-less
representation. It is in names that we think.
The mnemonics of the ancients, revived a while ago but appropriately forgot­
ten again, consists in transforming names into images, and thus again reducing
memory to imagination. The place of the power of memory is taken by a per­
manent tableau, fixed in the imagination, of a series of images to which is then
attached the composition to be learned by heart, the sequence of representations
in it. Given the heterogeneity between the content of these representations and
those permanent images, and also because of the speed with which the attach­
ment is supposed to occur, the attachment can only occur by way of shallow, silly,
and utterly contingent links. Not only is the mind put to the torture of being
bothered by insane stuff, but what is learnt by heart in this way is for that very
reason quickly forgotten, since in any case the same tableau is used for learning by
heart every other series of representations, and so those previously attached to it
are obliterated again.3 Unlike what is retained in memory, what is mnemonically
impressed is not produced by heart, i.e. strictly from the imide, from the deep pit

200

of the I, and thus recited, but is, so to speak, read off the tableau of the imagin­
ation.-Mnemonics is connected with the common prejudices which we have
about memory in comparison with imagination; as if imagination were a higher,
more spiritual activity than memory. On the contrary, memory no longer has to
do with the image, which is derived from intuition, from the intelligence when
it is determined in an immediate, unspiritual manner; it has rather to do with a
reality that is the product of intelligence itself-a reality known inside out that
remains enclosed in the inside of intelligence and is its outside, its existing side,
only within intelligence itself.4
Zusatz. The word as sounding vanishes in time; and so in the sounding word time
proves to be abstract negativity, that is to say, merely annihilating negativity. The
genuine, concrete negativity of the linguistic sign is the intelligence, since through
intelligence the sign is changed from something external to something internal
and is preserved in this recast form. words thus become a reality animated by
thought. This reality is absolutely necessary to our thoughts. We are only aware
of our thoughts, only have determinate, actual thoughts, when we give them the
form of objectivity, of being distinct from our inwardness, and thus the shape of
externality, and of an exter�ality, too, that at the same time bears the stamp of
the highest inwardness. Only the articulated sound, the word, is such an internal
externality. To want to think without words, as Mesmer once attempted, is, there­
fore, a manifest absurdity which drove this man, as he himself affirmed, to the
brink of insanity. But it is also ridiculous to regard the attachment of thought to
word as a defect of thought and a misfortune; for although the common opin­
ion is that it is just the ineffa ble that is the most excellent, yet this opinion,
nurtured by vanity, is entirely groundless, since the ineffable is, in truth, only
something murky, fermenting; it only gains clarity when it can get into words.
Accordingly, the word gives to thoughts their most worthy and genuine reality.
Of course, one can also grapple with words, without comprehending the thing.
But then what is at fault is not the word, but a defective, indeterminate, superfi­
cial thinking.5 Just as the genuine thought is the thing, so too is the word, when it
is employed by genuine thinking. Intelligence therefore, in filling itself with the
word, receives into itself the nature of the ihing.6 But this reception has anoth­
er sense too: intelligence thereby makes itself into something thingly, in such a
way that subjectivity, in its distinction from the thing, becomes quite empty,
a mindless container of words, it becomes mechanical memory. In this way the
excess of the recollection of the word veers round, so to speak, into extreme ali­
enation of the intelligence. As I become more familiar with the meaning of the
word, as the word thus unites more closely with my inwardness, increasingly the
objectivity and hence the determinacy of the meaning of the word can disappear,
increasingly, therefore, the memory itself, together with the word, can become
something bereft of mind. 7

Psychology, The Mind

§463
yy) In so far as the interconnection of names lies in the meaning, the connection
of the meaning with their being as names is still a synthesis; and in this its
externality the intelligence has not simply returned into itself. 1 But intelligence
is the universal; the simple truth of its particular self-externaliza.tions, and the
appropriation that it carries out, is the sublation of that distinction between
meaning and name. This supreme recollection of representing is the supreme
self-externaliza.tion of intelligence, in which it posits itself as the being, as the
universal space of names as such, i.e. of senseless words. Ego, which is this
abstract being, is, as subjectivity, at the same time the power over the various
names, the empty bond which establishes within itself series of them and keeps
them in stable order. So far as they just are, and intelligence within itself is
here itself this being of theirs, intelligence is this power as entirely abstract
subjectivity, - memory, which, on account of the complete externality in which
the members of such series stand to one another, and which is itself this
externality, albeit subjective externality, is called mechanical (§ 1 95). 2
[Remark] We obviously do not really know a composition by heart, until we
attach no sense to the words; the recitation of what is thus known by heart there­
fore automatically becomes accentless. If the correct stress is introduced, it aims
at the sense; conversely, if the meaning, the representation, is invoked, it disturbs
the mechanical sequence and therefore easily messes up the recitation.3 The capa­
city for being able to memorise by heart series of words, whose sequence involves
no intelligible principle or which are already senseless for themselves (a series of
proper names) , is so supremely marvellous, because it is the very essence of mind
to be in its right mind, but here the mind becomes self-externalized within itself,
and its activity a mechanism. But the mind is only in its right mind as unity of
subjectivity and objectivity; and here in memory, after the mind is initially in intu­
ition so external that it finds its determinations, and in representation recollects
thisfind into itself and makes it its own, as memory it makes itself external within
itself, so that what is its own presents itself as something that is found. One of
the two moments of thinking, objectivity, is here posited within intelligence as a
quality of intelligence itself. 4- It is tempting to conceive memory as a mechanic­
al activity, an activity of the senseless, in which case it is only j ustified by its use,
its indispensability perhaps for other purposes and activities of mind. But in so
doing we overlook the specific meaning that memory has in the mind. 5

§464
The being as name needs something else, the meaning of the representing intel­
ligence, in order to be the thing, the true objectivity.1 As mechanical memory,
intelligence is at once that external objectivity itself and the meaning. Intelligence
is thus posited as the existence of this identity, i.e. it is explicitly active as such an

202

Subjective Mind

identity which, as reason, intelligence implicitly is. 2 Memory is in this way the
transition into the activity of the thought, which has no meaning any more, i.e.
the subjective is no longer something different from its objectivity, just as this
inwardness is in being in its very self. 3
[Remark] Our language already assigns memory ( Gediichtnis), of which it has
become a prejudice to speak contemptuously, the high position of immediate
affinity with thought ( Gedanke) . -lt is not a matter of chance that the young
have a better memory than the old, nor is their memory exercised only for the
sake of utility. The young have a good memory because they do not yet take
thought in their conduct, and their memory is exercised intentionally or uninten­
tionally so as to level the terrain of their inwardness to pure being, to the pure
space in which the thing, the content that is in itself, can go its own way and
unfold itself without the opposition of a subjective inwardness. 4 A solid talent
in youth is generally combined with a good memory. But empirical details of
this sort give us no help 'ih knowing what memory intrinsically is. To grasp the
position and meaning of memory in the systematization of intelligence and to
comprehend its organic connection with thinking is one of the hitherto entirely
neglected, and in fact one of the most difficult points in the theory of mind.
Memory as such is itself the merely external mode, the one-sided moment of
thinking's existence; the transition is for us or in itself the identity of reason with
the mode of existence, an identity which brings it about that reason now exists in
the subject, as the activity of the subject. Thus reason is thinking. 5

( y) Thinking
§465
Intelligence is recognitive; -it cognizes an intuition, in so far as the intuition is
already its own (§454); moreover in the name it cognizes the thing (§462): but
now its universal is for intelligence in the double meaning of the universal as such
and the universal as immediate or as being, , l1ence as the genuine universal which
is the overarching unity of itself and its otber, being. 1 Thus intelligence is for
itselfintrimically cognitive; intrimically the universal; its product, the thought, is
the thing; simple identity of the subjective and objective. It knows that what is
thought, is; and that what is, only is in so far as it is a thought (cf. §§5, 21 ) ; -for
itself, the thinking of intelligence is having thoughts; they serve as the content and
object of intelligence. 2

Zusatz. Thinking is the third and last main stage in the development of
intelligence; for in thinking the immediate unity of the subjective and objective
present in intuition, a unity that is in itself, is restored out of the opposition of
these two sides arising in representation as a unity enriched by this opposition,
and so as a unity that is in and for itself, the end that is accordingly bent
back into the beginning. Thus at the standpoint of representation the unity of

Psychology, The Mind

203

the subjective and objective is effected partly by imagination and partly by
mechanical memory-though with the latter type of unity I do violence to
my subjectivity-and the unity still remains something subjective. In thinking,
by contrast, this unity acquires the form of a unity that is both subjective and
objective, since thinking is aware of its own selfas the nature of the thing.3 Of
course, people who have no understanding of philosophy throw up their hands in
amazement, when they hear the proposition: Thinking is being. Nevertheless, the
presupposition of the unity of thinking and being underlies all our activity. It is
as rational creatures, as thinking creatures that we make this presupposition. We
need to distinguish, however, whether we just are thinkers, or whether we are also
aware of ourselves as thinkers. We are thinkers in all circumstances; knowledge
of it, by contrast, occurs in a perfect manner only when we have risen to pure
thinking. Pure thinking knows that it alone, and not sensation or representation,
is in a position to grasp the truth of things, and that Epicurus 's claim that the
genuine is what is sensed, must therefore be pronounc;ed a complete perversion
of the nature of mind. 4 But of course, thinking must not remain abstract, formal
thinking, for this dismembers the content of truth; it must develop into concrete
thinking, into conceptual cognition.5

§466
But thinking cognition is likewise initiallyformal; the universality and its being is
the simple subjectivity of intelligence. The thoughts are thus not yet determined
in and for themselves, and the representations recollected to thinking are to that
extent still the content given. 1

Zusatz. Initially, thinking knows the unity of the subjective and objective as an
entirely abstract, indeterminate unity, a unity that is only certain, not folfilled,
not proven. The determinacy of the rational content is, therefore, still a determ­
inacy external to this unity, consequently a given determinacy, and cognition is
hence formal. But since this determinacy is implicitly contained in thinking cog­
nition, this formalism contradicts th)nking cognition and is therefore sublated by
thinking. 2
.

· ,

§467
In this content, thinking is ( 1 ) formally identical intellect, which works up the
recollected representations into genera, species, laws, forces, etc., in general into
the categories, in the sense that the material only has the truth of its being in these
thought-forms.1 As infinite negativity within itself, thinking is (2) essentially dir­
emption, -judgement, which, however, no longer breaks up the concept into the
previous opposition of universality and being, but differentiates in accordance
with the specific interconnections of the concept,2 and (3) thinking sublates the
form-determination and at the same time posits the identity of the differences: -

204

Subjective Mind

formal reason, concluding intellect. 3 Intelligence, as thinking, cognises; and in fact
when ( 1 ) the intellect explaim the individual by the intellect's own universalities
(the categories}, then it calls itself comprehending;4 (2) when it explaim the indi­
vidual as a universal (genus, species} , it does so in the judgement.5 In these forms
the content appears as given; but (3) in the inference the intellect determines content
from itself, by sublating that form-distinction. In the insight into necessity, the
last immediacy still adhering to formal thinking has vanished. 6
[Remark] In logic, thinking appears in its initial implicit form and as the unop­
posing medium in which reason develops. Thinking also occurs as a stage in
comciousness (see §437 Remark) . Here reason becomes the truth of the opposi­
tion as it had determined itself within the mind itself. -Thinking emerges again
and again in these different pans of science, because these parts differ only in
the medium and the form of the opposition; while thinking is this one, selfsame
centre, to which, as to their truth, the oppositions return.?

Zusatz. Before Kant, no one among us drew a determinate distinction between
intellect and reason. But if one does not want to sink to the level of the vulgar
consciousness which clumsily blurs the distinct forms of pure thinking, the fol­
lowing distinction must be established between intellect and reason: for reason,
the object is what is determined in and for itself, identity of the content and the
form, of the universal and the particular, for intellect, by contrast, the object falls
apart into the form and the content, into the universal and the particular, into an
empty in-itselfand the determinacy accruing to it from outside; thus in intellec­
tual thinking, the content is indifferent to its form, while in rational or conceptual
cognition the content produces its formfrom its own self.8
But though the intellect has in itself the defect just indicated, it is nevertheless a
necessary moment of rational thinking. Its activity consists, in general, in abstrac­
tion. Now if it separates off the contingent from the essential it is entirely within its
rights and appears as what in truth it ought to be. Therefore, someone who pur­
sues an essential purpose is called a man of intellect. Without intellect no firmness
of character is possible either, for this requires someone to hold firmly to their
individual essentiality. However, the intellect can also, conversely, give to a one­
sided determination the form of universality and thereby become the opposite of
sound common seme, endowed with a sense for the essential. 9
The second moment of pure thinking is judging. Intelligence which, as intel­
lect, tears apart from one another the various abstract determinatiom immedi­
ately united in the concrete individuality of the object and detaches them from
the object, necessarily proceeds, first of all, to relate the object to these universal
thought-determinatiom, and so to consider the object as relatiomhip, as an object­
ive interconnection, as a totality. Often this activity of intelligence is even called
comprehemion, but wrongly so. For at this standpoint the object is still conceived
as a given, as dependent on an Other and conditioned by it. The circumstances
which condition a phenomenon still count here as independent existences. Hence

Psychology, The Mind

205

the identity of the interrelated phenomena is still a merely inner, and for that very
reason merely external, identity. Here, therefore, the concept does not yet show
itself in its own guise, but in the form of non-conceptual necessity. 1 0
Only at the third stage of pure thinking is the concept recognized as such. Thus
this stage exhibits comprehension proper. Here the universal is recognised as par­
ticularizing its own self, and gathering itself together out of particularization
into individuality; or, what is the same thing, the panicular is demoted from its
independence to a moment of the concept. Accordingly, the universal is here no
longer a form external to the content, but the genuine form producing the con­
tent from its own self, - the self-developing concept of the thing. Consequently,
at this standpoint, thinking has no other content than itself, than its own determ­
inations, which constitute the immanent content of the form; in the object, it
seeks and finds only itself. Here, therefore, the object is distinguished from think­
ing only by having the form of being, of subsisting-for-itself Thus thinking stands
here in a completely free relationship to the object. 1 1
I n this thinking, which is identical with its object, intelligence reaches its con­
summation, its goal; for now it in fact is what in its immediacy it was only supposed
to be, -selfknowing truth, self-cognizing reason. Knowledge now constitutes the
subjectivity of reason, and objective reason is posited as knowledge. This reciprocal
interpenetration of thinking subjectivity and objective reason is the final result
of the development of theoretical mind through the stages, antecedent to pure
thinking, of intuition and representation. 12

§468
Intelligence, which as theoretical appropriates the immediate determinacy, is,
now that it has completed taking p�ssession, in its own property; by the last neg­
ation of immediacy it is implicitly posited that for the intelligence the content is
determined through the intelligence. Thinking, as the free concept, is now also
free in the content. When intelligence is aware of itself as what determines the
content, which is not only determined as being but is also intelligence's �wn con­
tent, it is will. I

Zusatz. Pure thinking is initially a self-effacing attitude, absorbed in the thing.
But this activity necessarily becomes objective to itself as well. Since conceptual
cognition is absolutely together with itselfin the object, it must recognize that its
determinations are determinations of the thing, and that, conversely, the object­
ively valid determinations, the determinations that are in being, are its determ­
inations. By this recollection, by this withdrawal-into-itself of intelligence,
intelligence becomes wil/.2 This transition is not of course present for ordinary
consciousness; for representation, thinking and will fall apart. But in truth, as we
have just seen, thinking is what determines itselfinto will and thinking remains
the substance of the will, so that without thinking there can be no will, and
even the most uncultured person is will only in so far as he has taken thought;

206

the animal, by contrast, because it does not think, is also incapable of having
a will.3

(b) PRA C TICAL MIND

§469
As will, the mind is aware of itself as reaching a conclusion within itself and
fulfilling itself from out of itself. 1 This fulfilled being-for-selfor individuality con­
stitutes the side of existence or reality for the Idea of mind; as will, the mind
steps into actuality, as knowledge it is on the terrain of the universality of the
concept.2-ln giving itself the content, the will is together with itself,free in gen­
eral; this is its determinate concept. -lts finitude consists in its formalism: its
self-fulfilment is the abstract determinacy, its own determinacy in general, and is
not identified with developed reason.3 The determination of the will that is in
itselfis to bring freedom in the formal will to existence, and therefore the pur­
pose of the formal will is to fulfil! itself with its concept, i.e. to make freedom its
determinacy, its content, and purpose, as well as its reality.4 This concept, free­
dom, essentially takes the form of thinking; the way of the will by which it makes
itself objective mind is to rise to the thinking will- to give itself the content that
it can only have as a will that thinks itself.5
[Remark] True freedom is ethical life, where the will has for its purposes a uni­
versal content, not subjective, i.e. self-centred content; but such content is only
possible in thinking and through thinking; it is nothing less than absurd to want
to exclude thinking from ethics, religion, lawfulness, etc. 6
Zusatz. Intelligence has turned out to be mind that withdraws into itselffrom the
object, that recollects itselfin the object and recognizes its inwardness as what is
objective. 7 The will now heads in the reverse direction, towards the objectijication
of its inwardness that is still burdened with the form of subjectivity. Here, how­
ever, in the sphere of subjective mind, we have to pursue this externalization only
up to the point where the willing intelligence becomes objective mind, i.e. to the
point where the product of the will ceases to be merely enjoyment and starts to
become deed and action. s
Now in general the course of development of practical mind is as follows.
Initially the will appears in the form of immediacy; it has not yet posited itself as
intelligence freely and objectively determining, but onlyfinds itself as such object­
ive determining. So it is a) practicalfeeling, has an individual content and is itself
immediately individual, subjective will, which, as we have just said, feels itself as
objectively determining, but still lacks a content that is liberated from the form
of subjectivity, a content that is genuinely objective, universal in andfor itself.9 For
this reason, will is initially only free in itself or by its concept. By contrast, the
Idea of freedom requires that the will make its concept, freedom itself, its content
or aim. When the will does this it becomes objective mind, constructs for itself

Psychology, The Mind

207

a world of its freedom, and thus gives to its genuine content an independent
reality. But the will achieves this aim only by working its way out of its individu­
ality, by developing its universality, which in individuality is only implicit, into a
content that is universal in andfor itself1 0
The next step on this path is taken by the will when �) as urge, it goes on to
make the agreement of its inward determinacy with objectivity, which in feeling
is onlygiven, into an agreement that ought first to be posited by the will. 1 1
The further step consists y) in the subordination of particular urges to a
universal, happiness. But since this universal is only a universality of reflection, it
remains something external to the particularity of urges, and is related to this
particularity only by the wholly abstract individual will, by wilfolness. 12
The indeterminate universal of happiness as well as the immediate particularity
of urges and the abstract individuality of wilfulness are, in their mutual extern­
ality, something untrue, and that is why they come together in the will that
wills the concrete universal, the concept of freedom. This will, as we have already
remarked, forms the goal of practical mind. B

§470
Practical mind initially involves, as formal or immediate will, a double ought:
( 1 ) in the opposition of the determinacy posited from out of itself to the imme­
diate determinedness that thereby enters again, the opposition to its reality and
condition, what in consciousness develops at the same time into the relationship
towards external objects. 1 (2) This first self-determination, being itself immedi­
ate, is not initially elevated into the universality of thinking; this universality
therefore constitutes in itself the ought addressed to that self-determination in
regard to form, as it can also constitute it in regard to the content; -an oppos­
ition that is initially only for us. 2

(a.) Practical Feeling

§471
The practical mind at first has its self-determination within itself in an immediate
way, and therefore formally, so that itfinds itselfas an individuality determined in
its internal nature. It is thus practicalfeeling. In this, since the mind is in itselfa
subjectivity simply identical with reason, it does have the content of reason, but
as an immediately individual, and therefore also natural, contingent and subjective
content which determines itself from the particularity of need, of opinion, etc.,
and from the subjectivity that posits itself for itself against the universal, just as
much as it can be, in itself, in conformity with reason.1
[Remark] Appeal is sometimes made to the feeling of right and morality, as well
as of religion, that man allegedly has in him, to his benevolent inclinations, etc.,
to his heart in general, i.e. to the subject in so far as the various practical feelings

208

Subjective Mind

are all combined in it. This appeal has ( 1 ) the correct sense that these determina­
tions are the subject's own, immanent determinations, (2) and then that in so far
as feeling is opposed to the intellect, feeling can be the totality, in contrast to the
one-sided abstractions of the intellect. But equally feeling can be one-sided, unes­
sential, bad. The rational, which in the shape of rationality is something thought,
is the same content as the good practical feeling has, but in its universality and
necessity, in its objectivity and truth.
For this reason it is, on the one hand, foolish to suppose that in the transition
from feeling to right and duty there is any loss of content and excellence; it is
this transition that first brings feeling to its truth. It is equally foolish to regard
the intelligence as superfluous, let alone harmful to feeling, heart, and will; the
truth and, what is the same thing, the actual rationality of the heart and will can
only reside in the universality of the intelligence, not in the individuality of feel­
ing as such. If feelings are of the right sort, it is because of their determinacy,
i.e. their content, and this is right only in so far as it is intrinsically universal,
i.e. has its source in the thinking mind. The difficulty for the intellect consists
in getting away from the separation that it has first wilfully made itself between
the soul-faculties, feeling, the thinking mind, and arriving at the idea that in the
human being there is only one reason in feeling, volition, and thinking. A diffi­
culty connected with this is found in the fact that the Ideas, which belong only to
the thinking mind, -God, right, ethics-can also be felt. But feeling is nothing
but the form of the immediate, peculiar individuality of the subject, a form into
which this content, like any other objective content to which consciousness also
ascribes objectivity,2 can be put.
On the other hand, it is suspect, and in fact far worse, to stick to feeling and
heart against thought out rationality, right, duty, law, because what more there
is in feeling than in rationality is only particular subjectivity, vanity and wilful­
ness.-For the same reason it is inept in the scientific consideration offeelings to
deal with anything more than their form, and to consider their content, since the
content, when it is thought out, rather constitutes the self-determinations of the
mind, rights and duties, in their universality and necessity. For the specific con­
sideration of practical feelings and inclinations, only the self-centred, bad, and
evil ones would remain; for these alone belong to the individuality which sticks
to itselfagainst the universal; their content is the opposite of the content of rights
and duties, but for that very reason they maintain their precise determinacy only
in opposition to rights and duties.3

§472
Practical feeling involves the ought, its self-determination as being in itself, related
to an individuality that is in being and which is allowed to count only in its
adequacy to that self-determination. But as both factors, in this immediacy, still

Psychology, The Mind

209

lack objective determination, this relation of need to reality is the utterly subject­
ive and superficial feeling of the pleasant or unpleasant. 1
[Remark] Delight, joy, grief, etc. , shame, remorse, contentment, etc., are in pan
only modifications of formal practical feeling in general, but they vary in their
content, which constitutes the determinacy of the ought. 2
The celebrated question about the origin ofevil in the world, at least in so far
as evil is understood to mean only the unpleasant and pain, comes in here, at the
standpoint of formal practicality. Evil is nothing but the inadequacy of being to
the ought. This ought has many meanings and, since contingent purposes likewise
have the form of the ought, infinitely many. In regard to contingent purposes,
evil is only the justice that is imposed on the vanity and nullity of their devising.
They themselves are already what is evil.3-The finitude of life and mind falls
into their judgement, in which they have the Other that is separated from them at
the same time within them as their negative, and thus they are the contradiction
called evil. In a dead thing there is no evil or pain, because in inorganic nature the
concept does not confront its reality and does not in the distinction at the same
time remain its subject. Already in life, and still more in mind, this immanent
differentiation is present and thus an ought comes in; and this negativity, sub­
jectivity, I, freedom are the principles of evil and pain.4-Jakob Bohme viewed
!-hood as agony and torment, and as the source of nature and ofspirit.5
Zusatz. Although in practical feeling the will has the form of simple identity with
itself, nevertheless in this identity difference is already present; for though practic­
al feeling is aware of itself, on the one hand, as objectively valid self-determining, as
something determined in andfor itself, yet, on the other hand, it is also aware of
itself as determined immediately orfrom outside, as subject to the alien determinacy
of affections. Thefeeling will is, therefore, the comparing of its immediate determ­
inedness coming from outside, with the determinedness posited in it by its own
nature. Since the latter has the meaning of what ought to be, the will demands
that the affection agree with it. This agreement is the pleasant, disagreement is the
unpleasant. 6
But since this inner determinacy to which the affection is related is itself still an
immediate determinacy belonging to my natural individuality, is still subjective,
onlyfelt, the judgement resulting from this relation can only be an entirely super­
ficial and contingent j udgement. Therefore, in the case of important things, the
circumstance that something is pleasant or unpleasant to me appears as supremely
indifferent.
Practical feeling receives, however, still further determinations than the super­
ficial ones just discussed.
There are, namely, in the second place, feelings which, since their content
derives from intuition or from representation, surpass in determinacy the feeling of
the pleasant or unpleasant. To this class of feelings belong, for example, delight,
joy, hope, fear, anguish, pain, etc. Joy consists in the feeling of accordance of

210

Subjective Mind

my determinedness-in-and-for-itself with an individual event, a thing, or person.
Contentment, by contrast, is more a lasting, peacefUl harmony without intens­
ity. In merriment we find a more lively harmony. Fear is the feeling of my self,
and at the same time of an evil that threatens to destroy my self-feeling. In ter­
ror, I sense the sudden discordance between something external and my positive
self-feeling. 7
All these feelings have no content immanent in them, belonging to their peculiar
nature; the content enters into themfrom outside. 8
Lastly, there is a third kind of feelings arising when the substantial content of
right, morality, ethics, and religion, a content that derives from thinking, is also
taken up into the feeling will. When this happens, we have to do with feelings
that are distinguished from one another by their own peculiar content and gain
their j ustification by this content. To this class also belong shame and remorse;
for both have, as a rule, an ethical basis. Remorse is the feeling of the discord­
ance between my activity and my duty, or even only my advantage, in each case,
therefore, between my activity and something determined-in-and-for-itself.9
But when we said that the feelings just discussed have their own peculiar con­
tent, this must not be understood to mean that the content of right, ethics, and
religion is necessarily in feeling. That this content is not inseparably conjoined
with the feeling can be seen in an empirical way from the fact that remorse can be
sensed even over a good deed. It is, too, very far from being absolutely necessary
that in relating my action to duty, I should succumb to the agitation and heat
of feeling; I can also settle the relation in representational consciousness and thus
content myselfwith a calm consideration of the matter. 1 0
Just as little need the content enter into feeling in the second kind of feel­
ings discussed above. A sensible person, a great character, can find something in
harmony with his will without giving way to the feeling of joy, and, conversely,
can suffer misfortune without giving way to the feeling of pain. Anyone who
succumbs to such feelings is more or less caught up in the conceit of attach­
ing particular importance to the fact that just he, this particular ego, experiences
either good fortune or bad. 1 I

(�) Urges and Wilfulness
§473
The practical ought is a real judgement. The immediate adequacy, merely found
before us, of the current determinacy to the need is a negation for the self
determination of the will and inadequate to it. If the will, i.e. the implicit unity
of the universality and the determinacy, is to satisfY itself, i.e. be for itself, the
adequacy of its inner determination and the reality ought to be posited by it.1 The
will, as regards the form of its content, is initially still natural will, immediately
identical with its determinacy, urge and inclination; in so far as the totality of the

Psychology, The Mind

21 1

practical mind places itself into a single one of the many restricted determinations,
posited in general with the opposite, it is passion.2
Zusatz. In practical feeling, it is a contingent matter whether the immediate affec­
tion agrees with the inner determinacy of the will or not. This contingency, this
dependence on an external objectivity, contradicts the will that knows itself to be
determined-in-and-for-itself, that is aware of the objectivity contained in its sub­
jectivity. The will cannot, therefore, rest content with comparing its immanent
determinacy with something external and just finding the agreement of these two
sides; it must go on to posit objectivity as a moment of its self-determination, and
therefore to produce this agreement, its satisfaction, itsel£ Volitional intelligence
thereby develops into the urge. This is a subjective will-determination which gives
itself its own objectivity.
The urge must be distinguished from mere desire. Desire belongs, as we saw
in §426, to self-consciousness and so occupies the standpoint where the opposition
between the subjective and objective is not yet overcome. Desire is something indi­
vidual, and seeks only what is individual for an individual, momentary satisfac­
tion. The urge, on the other hand, since it is a form of volitional intelligence, statts
from the sublated opposition of the subjective and the objective, and involves a
series of satisfactions, and so is something whole, universal. At the same time, how­
ever, the urge, coming as it does from the individuality of practical feeling and
forming only the first negation of it, is still something particular. That is why the
man who is absorbed in urges appears as unfree.3

§474
Inclinations and passions have the same determinations for their content as prac­
tical feelings, and likewise have, on the one hand, the rational nature of the
mind as their foundation; but on the other hand, belonging as they do to the
still subjective, individual will, they are affiicted with contingency, and seem in
their particularity to stand both to the individual and to each other in an external
relationship and thus with an unfree necessity. 1
[Remark] Passion involves in its determination that it is restricted to a partic­
ularity of the determination of the will, in which the whole subjectivity of the
individual immerses itself, whatever the content of that determination may be.
But owing to this formality, passion is neither good nor evil; this form only
expresses that a subject has placed the whole vital interest of its mind, talent, char­
acter, enjoyment in one content. Nothing great has been and nothing great can be
accomplished without passion. It is only a dead, too often, indeed, a hypocritical
morality which inveighs against the very form of passion. 2
But with the inclinations, the question is immediately raised, which are good
and which evil, similarly, up to what point the good remain good, and, since each
is a particular type contrasting with the others and there are many of them, how
they must, since they all reside in one subject and, to go by experience, can hardly

212

Subjective Mind

all be satisfied, at least restrain themselves in the face of each other. Initially it is
the same situation with these numerous urges and inclinations as with the powers
of the soul, the collection of which is supposed to be the theoretical mind-a
collection which is now increased by the host of urges.3 The fonnal rationality
of the urge and the inclination consists simply in their universal urge not to be
subjective, but to sublate subjectivity by the activity of the subject itself, to be
realized. Their genuine rationality cannot emerge in an examination conducted
by external reflexion, which presupposes independent natural determinations and
immediate urges, and therefore lacks the single principle and final purpose for
them. But it is the immanent reflexion of the mind itself, going beyond their
particulafity, beyond their natural immediacy, and giving their content rationality
and objectivity, in which they become necessary relationships, rights and duties.4
It is this objectification then, which displays their content as well as their rela­
tionship to each other, in general their truth; thus it was with genuine insight
that Plato showed that he could explain what justice is in and for itself only in
the objective shape of justice, namely in the construction of the state as the ethical
life, and also that he included the whole nature of the mind under the right ofthe
mind.5
So the question which are the good, rational inclinations and how they are to be
subordinated to each other, turns into a presentation of the relationships that the
mind produces when it develops as objective mind-a development in which the
content of self-determination loses its contingency or wilfulness. The treatment of
urges, inclinations, and passions in their genuine content is thus essentially the
theory oflegal, moral, and ethical duties.

§475
The subject is the activity of satisfying urges, of formal rationality, namely of
translating the content, which in this respect is purpose, from subjectivity into
objectivity, in which the subject joins together with itself. In so far as the con­
tent of the urge is distinguished as the imponant thing from this activity of the
subject, the thing which has come about contains the moment of subjective indi­
viduality and its activity: this is interest. Nothing comes about therefore without
interest. 1
[Remark] An action is both a purpose o f the subject and also the subject's activ­
ity which carries out this purpose; it is only because the subject is in this way in
even the most unselfish action, i.e. because of its interest, that there is an action
at all . 2- Urges and inclinations are sometimes contrasted with, on the one hand,
the empty dream of a natural happiness, by which needs are supposed to find
their satisfaction without the subject's activity of producing conformity between
immediate existence and his inner determinations. They are sometimes contras­
ted quite generally, on the other hand, with duty for duty's sake, with morality.
But urge and passion are nothing but the life-blood of the subject, by which the

Psychology, The Mind

213

subject itself is in his purpose and the execution o f it. The ethical concerns the
content, which as such is the universal, an inactive thing, that has its activating
agent in the subject; the immanence of the content in the subject is interest and,
if it lays claim to the whole efficacious subjectivity, passion.3
Zusatz. Even in the purest rightful, ethical, and religious will, which has only its
concept, freedom, as its content, there also lies the individualization into a this,
to something natural. This moment of individuality must obtain its satisfaction
even in the execution of the most objective purposes; I, as this individual, do not
wish, nor ought I, to perish in the execution of the purpose. This is my interest.
This must not be confused with selfishness; for selfishness prefers its particular
content to the objective content.4

§476
The will, as thinking and implicitly free, distinguishes itself from the particular­
ity of the urges, and places itself as simple subjectivity of thinking above their
diversified content. It is thus rejlectingwill.1

§477
Such a particularity of the urge is in this way no longer immediate, but for the
first time the will's own particularity, because the will joins together with it and
thus gives itself determinate individuality and actuality. The will is at the stand­
point of choosing between inclinations, and is wilfolness. 1

§478
Will as wilfulness is free for itself, in that it is reflected into itself as the negativity
of its merely immediate self-determination. 1 However in so far as the content, in
which this formal universality of the will resolves itself into actuality, is still just
the content of the urges and inclinations, the will is actual only as subjective and
contingent will. It is a contradiction: it actualizes itself in a particularity, which is
at the same time a nullity for it, and has a satisfaction in the particularity which
it has at the same time left behind. As this contradiction, it is initially the process
of distraction and of sublating one inclination or pleasure by another, and of
sublating the satisfaction, which is just as much no satisfaction, by another to
infinity. But the truth ofparticular satisfactions is the universal satisfaction, which
the thinking will makes its purpose as happiness. 2

( y) Happiness
§479
In this representation, produced by reflective thinking, of a universal satisfac­
tion, the urges, in respect of their particularity, are posited as negative; and they

214

Subjective Mind

are supposed to be sacrificed, both sacrificed one to another for the sake of that
purpose, and sacrificed to that purpose directly, in whole or in part. 1 Their limit­
ation by each other is, on the one hand, a mixture of qualitative and quantitative
determination; on the other hand, as happiness has affirmative content in the
urges alone, the decision lies with them, and it is subjective feeling and taste
which must have the final say in deciding where its happiness lies. 2

§480
Happiness is only the represented, abstract universality of the content, a univer­
sality which only ought to be. 1 But the truth of the particular determinacy, which
just as much is as it is sublated, and of the abstract individuality, the wilfulness
which both gives and does not give itself a purpose in happiness, is the universal
determinacy of the will in the will itself, i.e. its vety self-determination, freedom.
In this way wilfulness is will only as pure subjectivity, which is pure and concrete
at once, by having as its content and purpose only that infinite determinacy, free­
dom itself. In this truth of its self-determination, where concept and object are
identical, the will is-actuallyfree will. 2

(c) FREE MIND

§481
The actual free will is the unity of theoretical and practical mind; free will, which
is for itselfas free will, now that the formalism, the contingency and limitedness
of the previous practical content have sublated themselves. By the sublation of
the mediation that was involved in all this, the will is the immediate individuality
posited by itself, but an individuality that is also purified to universal determin­
ation, to freedom itself. 1 The will has this universal determination as its object
and purpose, in that it thinks itself, is aware of this concept of itself, is will as free
intelligence. 2

§482
The mind which is aware of itself as free and wills itself as this object of itself,
i.e. has its essence as its determination and purpose, is first of all in general the
rational will, or in itselfthe Idea, thus only the concept of absolute mind. Since it is
abstract the Idea is again existent only in the immediate will, it is the side of reas­
on's reality, the individual will as knowledge of that determination of itself which
constitutes its content and purpose, and of which the will is only the formal activ­
ity. The Idea thus appears only in the will that is a finite will, but which is the
activity of developing the Idea and of positing the Idea's self-unfolding content as
reality, which, as reality of the Idea, is actuality: -objective mind. 1

215

Psychowgy, The Mind

[Remark] No Idea is so generally recognized as indeterminate, ambiguous, and
open to the greatest misconceptions, to which therefore it actually falls prey, as
the Idea offreedom, and no Idea is in common circulation with so little conscious­
ness of it. Since the free mind is the actual mind, misconceptions about it have
the most tremendous practical consequences, and when individuals and peoples
have once got in their heads the abstract concept of freedom that is for itself, there
is nothing like it in its uncontrollable strength, just because it is the very essence
of mind, and is in fact its very actuality. 2 Whole continents, Mrica and the East,
have never had this Idea, and are without it still; the Greeks and Romans, Pla­
to and Aristotle, even the Stoics, did not have it; on the contrary, they knew
only that man is actually free by birth (as an Athenian, Spartan, etc., citizen),
or by strength of character, education, by philosophy (the wise man is free even
as a slave and in chains) . This Idea came into the world through Christianity,
according to which the individual as such has an infinite value since it is the object
and aim of God's love, destined to stand in its absolute relationship with God as
mind, and to have this mind dwelling in himself, i.e. man in himselfis destined
to supreme freedom. In religion as such man is aware of the relationship to the
absolute mind as his essence, but now he has, in addition, the presence of the
divine mind, even when he enters the sphere of worldly existence, as the substance
of the state, of the family, etc. These relationships are developed through that
mind, and are constituted in conformity to it, while by such existence the ethical
disposition comes to be indwelling in the individual and then in this sphere of
particular existence, of present sensation and volition, he is actuallyfree. 3
If knowledge of the Idea, i.e. of men's knowledge that their essence, purpose,
and object is freedom, is speculative, then this Idea itself as such is the actuality of
men, not an Idea that they have about it, but an Idea that they are.4 In its adher­
ents Christianity has made it their actuality e.g. not to be a slave; if they were
made slaves, if the decision on their property were left to someone's discretion,
not to laws and law-courts, they would find the substance of their life impaired.
This will to freedom is no longer an urge which demands its satisfaction, but the
character, - the spiritual consciousness that has become urgeless being.5 But
this freedom, which has the content and purpose of freedom, is itself initially
only a concept, a principle of the mind and heart, and destined to develop into
objectivity, into legal, ethical, religious actuality, as well as scientific actuality.6

§483
The objective mind is the absolute Idea, but it is only so in itself, since it is thus
on the terrain of finitude, its actual rationality retains in it the aspect of extern­
al appearance. The free will initially has these distinctions in it immediately:
freedom is its inner determination and aim and it enters into relation with an
external objectivity that it finds before it, an objectivity that splits up into the
anthropological factor of panicular needs, external things of nature which are
for consciousness, and the relationship of individual wills to individual wills,
which are a self-consciousness of themselves in their diversity and particularity;
this aspect makes up the external material for the embodiment of the will.1

§484
But the purposive activity of this will is to realize its concept, freedom, in the
externally objective realm, making it a world determined by the will, so that in it
the will is at home with itself, joined together with itself, the concept accordingly
completed to the Idea. Freedom, shaped into the actuality of a world, acquires the
form ofnecessity, whose substantial interconnexion is the system of the determin­
ations of freedom, and its apparent interconnexion is power, recognition, i.e. its
validity in consciousness. 1

§485
This unity of the rational will with the individual will, with the immediate and
peculiar element of the operation of the rational will, constitutes the simple actu­
ality of freedom. Since freedom and its content belong to thinking and are the
universal in itself, the content has its genuine determinacy only in the form of
universality. When posited in this form for the consciousness of intelligence with
the determination of valid power, the content is law, -the content, freed from
the impurity and contingency that it has in practical feeling and in the urge, and

218

Objective Mind

likewise impressed on the subjective will, not in the form of feeling and urge, but
in its universality, as the will's habit, disposition and character, then it is custom. 1

§486
This reality in general, as embodiment of the free will, is right, which is to be taken
comprehensively, not only as restricted juridical right, but as the embodiment of
all determinations of freedom.1 In relation to the subjective will, in which they,
being universal, are supposed to have and can only have their embodiment, these
determinations are its duties, while as habit and disposition in the subjective will
they are custom. That which is a right is also a duty, and what is a duty is also a
right. For an embodiment is a right only on the basis of the free substantial will;
the very same content, in relation to the will differentiating itself as subjective
and individual, is duty. It is the same content which the subjective consciousness
recognizes as duty, and brings to embodiment in individual wills. The finitude of
the objective will is in this respect the semblance of a distinction between rights
and duties. 2
[Remark] In the field of appearance right and duty are initially correlates: to a
right on my part corresponds a duty in someone else. But, as to the concept, my
right to a thing is not merely possession, but as possession by a person it is prop­
erty, lawful possession, and it is a duty to possess things as property, i.e. to be a per­
son. When this is posited in the relationship of appearance, of relation to another
person, it develops into the duty of the other to respect my right.3 The moral duty
in general is, in me as a free subject, at the same time a right of my subjective
will, of my disposition. But in morality there arises the divergence between the
merely inner determination of the will (disposition, intention), which has its real­
ity only in me and is only subjective duty, and the actuality of that determination,
which involves a contingency and imperfection that constitute the one-sidedness
of the merely moral standpoint.4 In ethical life these two sides have reached their
truth, their absolute unity; though here too duty and right return to one anoth­
er and join together, as is the way of necessity, through mediation. The rights of
the father of the family over its members are equally duties towards them, just as
the children's duty of obedience is their right to be brought up to be free human
beings. The government's penal j ustice, its rights of administration, etc., are also
its duties to punish, to administer, etc., just as the contributions of members of
the state in taxes, military service, etc., are duties and equally their right to the
protection of their private property and of the general substantial life in which
they have their roots; all purposes of society and of the state are the personal pur­
poses of private individuals; but the path of the mediation, by which their duties
come back to them as the exercise and enjoyment of rights, produces the appear­
ance of diversity, added to which is the way in which the value assumes various
forms in the exchange, though in itself it is the same. But it essentially holds good
that whoever has no rights has no duties, and vice versa. 5

§487
The free will is:
(A) itself initially immediate, and hence individual- the person; the embod­

iment which the person gives to its freedom is property. Right as such is
formal, abstract right; 1
(B) reflected into itself, so that it has its embodiment inside it, and is thereby
at the same time determined as particular, the right of the subjective
will,- morality;2
(C) the substantial will, as the actuality, conformable to the concept of the
will, in the subject and a totality of necessity- ethical life, in family, civil
society, and state.3
[Remark] Since I have set out this part of philosophy in my Elements of Right
(Berlin, 1 82 1 ) I can express myself more briefly than I did on the other parts.

A. Right
( a ) P RO P E RTY

§488
Mind, in the immediacy of its freedom, the freedom that is for itself, is an indi­
vidual, but an individual that is aware of its individuality as absolutely free will; it
is a person, the self-awareness of this freedom, an intrinsically abstract and empty
self-awareness that does not yet have its particularity and fulfillment in itself, but
in an external thing. This thing, as an entity devoid of will, has no right against
the subjectivity of intelligence and wilfulness, and subjectivity makes it an acci­
dent of itself, the external sphere of its freedom-possession. 1

§489
The predicate of mine, which the thing obtains through the judgement of pos­
session initially in the external appropriation, is for itself merely practical, but
here it has the meaning that I put my personal will into the thing. Through this
determination the possession is property, which as possession is a means, but as
embodiment of personality is an end. 1

§490
In property the person is joined together with himself. But the thing is an
abstractly external thing, and the I in it is abstractly external. The concrete return
of me into myself in the externality is this: I, the infinite relation of me to myself,
am as a person the repulsion of me from myself, and have the embodiment of my
personality in the being ofotherpersom, in my relation to them and in recognition
by them, which is thus reciprocal. 1

§491
The thing is the mean by which the extremes, the persons who, in the awareness
of their identity as free, are at the same time mutually independent, join together.
For them my will has its determinate discernible embodiment in the thing by the
immediate physical seizure of possession, or by my forming the thing or even by
the mere designation of it. 1

Right

22 1

§492
The contingent aspect of property is that I place my will in this thing; in this
respect my will is wi!folness, so that I can as well place my will in it or not, just as
well withdraw it or not. But in so far as my will lies in a thing, only I myself can
withdraw it, and only with my will can the thing pass to another, whose property
it similarly becomes only with his will: -contract. 1

(b) CONTRA C T

§493
The two wills and their agreement in the contract are an internal matter, different
from the realization of the contract, the performance. The relatively-ideal expres­
sion in the stipulation involves the actual surrender of a property by the one will,
the transference and the reception into the other will. The contract is valid in and
for itself and does not become so only through the performance of one or the oth­
er party, which would imply an infinite regress or infinite division of the thing, the
labour, and the time. The expression in the stipulation is complete and exhaust­
ive. The inwardness of the will that surrenders the property and of the will that
receives it is in the realm of representation, and in this realm the word is deed and
thing (§462), and it is thefolly valid deed, since here the will does not come into
consideration as moral will (whether it is meant seriously or as a deception) , but
only as will over an external thing. 1

§494
In the stipulation the substance of the contract is distinguished from the real
expression in the performance, which is reduced to its consequence. Similarly a
distinction is thereby posited in the thing or performance between its immediate
specific constitution and its substance or value, in which the qualitative constitu­
tion changes into quantitative determinacy; a property thus becomes comparable
with another, and can be equated to what is qualitatively wholly heterogeneous.
It is thus posited in general as abstract, universal thing. 1

§495
Contract, as an agreement resulting from wilfulness and concerning a contingent
thing, involves at the same time the positedness of the accidental will. This will
is just as easily not in conformity with right, and thus produces wrong. But this
does not sublate right, which is in and for itself; it only gives rise to a relationship
ofright to wrong. l

222

Objective Mind
(c) RIGH T VERS US WR ONG

§496
Right, as the embodiment of freedom in the external sphere, breaks up into a mul­
tiplicity of relations to this external sphere and to other persons (§§491, 493jf).
I n this way there are ( 1 ) several legal claims. Since property i s exclusively indi­
vidual in respect both of the person and of the thing, only one of these claims is
the right, but because the claims oppose each other, they are jointly posited as the
semblance of right, in contrast to which right itself is now determined as right in
itself1

§497
Since, in opposition to this semblance, the single right in itself, still in immediate
unity with the various claims, is posited as affirmative, is willed and recognized,
the only difference lies in this, that this thing is subsumed under the right by the
particular will of these persons: inadvertent wrong. - This wrong is a simple negat­
ivejudgement, which expresses the civil lawsuit, for the settlement of which a third
judgement is required, which, as the j udgement of right in itself, has no interest in
the thing, and is the power of giving reality to itself against that semblance. 1

§498
But {2) if the semblance of right is willed as such against right-in-itself by the
particular will, which thus becomes evil, then the external recognition of right is
separated from the value of right and only the recognition is respected, while
right itself is violated. This gives the wrong offtaud: -the infinite judgement as
identical (§ 1 73),-the formal relation is retained, but the substance is lefi: out. 1

§499
(3) Finally, the particular will opposes right-in-itself by negating both right itself
and its recognition or semblance. (This is negatively infinite judgement (§ 1 73) in
which the genus is negated as well as the particular determinacy, in this case the
apparent recognition.) Thus the will is violently evil, and commits a crime. 1

§500
As violation of right, such an action is in and for itself null and void. In the action
the agent, as a will and a thinking being, sets up a law, but a formal law recog­
nized by the agent alone, a universal which is valid for him, and under which he
has at the same time subsumed himself by his action. To display the nullity of
this action, to implement at a single stroke this formal law and right-in-itself, ini­
tially through a subjective individual will, is revenge. Because revenge starts from

Right

223

the interest of immediate, particular personality, it is at the same time only a new
violation, and so on to infinity. This progression likewise sublates itself in a third
judgement, which is disinterested-punishment. 1

§501
The self-enforcement of right-in-itself is mediated a) by the fact that a particular
will, the judge, is in conformity with right and has an interest in turning against
the crime (which initially, in revenge, is contingent), 1 and �) by the (likewise ini­
tially contingent) power of implementation, the power of negating the negation
of right posited by the criminal. This negation of right has its existence in the will
of the criminal; consequently revenge or punishment is directed ( 1 ) at the person
or property of the criminal and (2) exercises coercion against him. Coercion takes
place in this sphere of right in general, even against the thing when I seize it and
maintain it against another's seizure, since in this sphere the will has its embod­
iment immediately in an external thing (in a thing as such or in bodiliness) , and
can be seized only at this point. 2- But coercion is no more than possible, in so
far as I can withdraw myself, as free, from every existence, even from the range
of existence, from life.3 Coercion is legitimate only as the sublation of a first,
immediate coercion. 4

§502
A distinction has developed between right and the subjective will. The reality
of right, which the personal will initially gives itself in an immediate manner,
shows itself to be mediated by the subjective will, by the moment that gives
embodiment to right-in-itself or perhaps diverges from it and sets itself against
it. 1 Conversely; the subjective will in this abstraction, of being the power over
right, is for itself a nullity; it has truth and reality essentially only when within
itself it becomes the embodiment of the rational will,- morality.2
[Remark] The expression natural right, which has been customary for philosoph­
ical jurisprudence, involves ambiguity: it may mean that right is present in an
immediately natural way, or it may mean that right is determined by the nature of
the thing, i.e. by the concept. Formerly it was usually meant in the first sense; so
that a state ofnature has also been concocted, in which natural right is supposed
to obtain, whereas the state of society and of the political state rather requires
and introduces a restriction of freedom and a sacrifice of natural rights. But in
fact right and all its determinations are based on the free personality alone, a self
determination, which is the very contrary of determination by nature. The right of
nature is therefore the embodiment of strength and the assertion of force, and a
state of nature a state of violence and wrong, of which nothing truer can be said
than that one ought to depart from it. Society, by contrast, is rather the state in
which alone right has its actuality; what is to be restricted and sacrificed is just the
wilfulness and violence of the state of nature. 3

B . Morality
§503
The free individual, who, in (immediate) right, is only a person, is now determ­
ined as a subject, will reflected into itself, so that the determinacy of the will
in general becomes, as embodiment within the will, the will's own determin­
acy, distinct from the embodiment of freedom in an external thing. 1 Because
the determinacy of the will is thus posited internally, the will at the same time
becomes a particular will, and there arise the further particularizations of it and
the relations of these to one another.2 The determinacy of the will is partly the
determinacy that is in itself, the determinacy of the will's reason, what is lawful
(and ethical) in itself; partly it is the embodiment present in the active expression,
an embodiment that sets out and comes into relationship with the determinacy.
The subjective will is morally free, in so far as these determinations are inwardly
posited as its own and willed by it. Its active expression with this freedom is action,
in the externality of which the will only recognizes as its own, and allows to be
imputed to it, what it has willed within itself in full awareness. 3
[Remark] It is especially this subjective or moral freedom that is called freedom
in the European sense. In virtue of the right of freedom man must specifically
possess a knowledge of the difference between good and evil in general; ethical
and religious determinations are supposed not to make a claim on him for his
compliance only as external laws and regulations of an authority, but to have their
approval, recognition, or even justification in his heart, disposition, insight, etc.
The subjectivity of the will within itself is an end in itself, an absolutely essential
moment.4
Morality must be taken in the wider sense in which it does not mean merely the
morally good. In the French language 'le moral' is contrasted with 'le physique',
and means the spiritual, intellectual in general. But here morality has the mean­
ing of a determinacy of the will, in so far as it is in the interior of the will in
general, and thus includes the purpose and the intention, as well as moral evil. s
-

(a) P URPOSE

§504
In so far as the action immediately concerns reality, then what is mine is formal,
in so far as external reality is also independent of the subject. This externality can

Morality

225

pervert his action and bring about something different from what was involved
in the action. Although all alteration as such, which is posited by the activity of
the subject, is the subject's deed, still the subject does not for that reason recognize
it as its action; it recognizes as its own, as its responsibility, only that reality in the
deed which lay in its knowledge and will, which was its purpose. 1

(b) INTENTION AND WELL -BEING

§505
The action has ( 1 ) as regards its empirically concrete content a variety of partic­
ular aspects and connections; in respect of form, the subject must have known
and willed the action in its essential determination, which embraces within itself
these individual details: right ofintention. The purpose concerns only the imme­
diate reality, but the intention concerns the substance and the aim of it. 1 (2) The
subject likewise has the right that the particularity of the content in the action,
in respect to the matter, is not a particularity external to him, but the subject's
own particularity, that it contain his needs, interests, and aims, which, when sim­
ilarly concentrated into one aim, as in happiness (§479), constitute his well-being.
the right of well-being. Happiness is distinguished from well-being only in this,
that happiness is conceived just as an immediate reality, whereas well-being is
regarded as justifiable in relation to morality.2

§506
But the essentiality of the intention is initially the abstract form of universality,
and in the empirically concrete action reflection can put this or that particular
aspect into this form and thus make it, as essential, the intention or restrict the
intention to it. In this way the supposed essentiality of the intention and the
genuine essentiality of the action can be brought into the greatest contradiction
(e.g. a good intention in a crime) . l - Similarly well-being is abstract and may
be placed in this or that: as pertaining to this subject, it is something altogether
particular.2

(c) G O OD AND E VIL

§507
The truth of these particularities, and the concreteness of their formalism, is the
content of the universal will that is in andfor itself the law and the substance of
all determinacy, the good in andfor itself, hence the absolutefinal aim ofthe world,
and the duty for the subject who ought to have insight into the good, make it his
intention and bring it about by his activity. 1

226

Objective Mind

§508
But the good is in fact the intrinsically determinate universal of the will and thus
contains particularity within itself; yet in so far as this particularity is itself ini­
tially still abstract, no principle of determination is available; determining also
occurs outside this universality; and since what is determined is the free will that
is for itself, in contrast to such determining, there arises here the deepest contra­
diction. a) Because of the indeterminate determining of the good, there are in
general varieties of good and several duties, the diversity ofwhich involves dialect­
ical opposition berween them and brings them into collision. At the same time,
because of the unity of the good, they ought to stand in harmony; and yet each of
them, though it is a particular duty, is, as duty and as good, absolute. The sub­
ject ought to be the dialectic which decisively concludes a combination of them by
excluding the others and thus sublating this absolute validity. 1

§509
�) To the subject, who in the reality of his freedom essentially becomes a par­
ticular, his interest and well-being ought, because of this reality of his freedom,
be an essential aim and therefore a duty. But at the same time in the aim of the

good, which is not the particular but only the universal of the will, the particu­
lar interest ought not to be a moment. Because of this independence of the rwo
determinations, it is likewise contingent whether they harmonize. But they ought
to harmonize, because in general the subject, as individual and universal, is in
itselfone identity. I
y) But the subject is not only in its reality a particular in general; it is also
a form of its reality to be abstract self-certainty, abstract reflection of freedom
into itself. The subject is thus distinct from the reason of the will, and capable
of making the universal itself into a particular and thus into a semblance. The
good is thus posited as a contingency for the subject, who can therefore resolve on
something opposed to the good, can be evi/.2

§5 10
o) External objectivity, i n accordance likewise with the distinction that has
emerged berween it and the subjective will (§503), constitutes the other extreme,
independent of the internal determinations of the will, a peculiar world for
itself. It is therefore contingent whether it harmonizes with the subjective aims,
whether the good realizes itself in it, while evil, the aim that is in and for itself null,
is null in it; -contingent too whether the subject finds in it his well-being, and
more precisely whether in it the good subject becomes happy and the evil subject
unhappy. But at the same time the world ought to let what is essential, the good
action, be carried out in it, as it ought to grant the good subject the satisfaction of

Morality

227

his particular interest, but refuse it to the evil subject, j ust as it ought to nullifY evil
itself. 1

§51 1
The all-round contradiction, which this multiple ought, the absolute being which
yet at the same time is not, expresses, contains the most abstract analysis of
the mind within itself, its deepest descent into itself. The relation of the self­
contradictory determinations to each other is only the abstract certainry of itself,
and for this infinity of subjectivity the universal will, the good, right, and duty,
both is and is not; it is this subjectivity that is aware of itself as what chooses and
decides. 1 This pure self-certainty, rising to its peak, appears in the two forms of
conscience and evil, which immediately pass into each other. Conscience is the will
of the good, which, however, in this pure subjectivity is the non-objective, non­
universal, the indescribable, and over which the subject is aware that he in his
individuality has the decision. But evil is this very awareness of his individuality as
the decision-maker, in so far as his individuality does not remain in this abstrac­
tion, but gives itself the content of a subjective interest contrary to the good.2

§512
This highest peak of the phenomenon of the will, which evaporates into this abso­
lute vanity- into a non-objective, but merely self-certain goodness, and a cer­
tainty of itself in the nullity of the universal- immediately collapses. 1 Evil, as
the most intimate reflection of subjectivity into itself in opposition to the object­
ive and universal (which is, for subjectivity, only semblance), is the same as the
good disposition towards the abstract good, which leaves the determination of the
good up to subjectivity: - the utterly abstract semblance, the immediate perver­
sion and annihilation of itself.2 The result, the truth of this semblance, is, on its
negative side, the absolute nullity of this willing, that is supposed to be for itself
in contrast to the good, and the absolute nullity of the good, that is supposed
to be only abstract; on the affirmative side, this semblance, thus collapsing, is, in
concept, the same simple universality of the will as the good is.3 Subjectivity, in
this its identity with the good, is only the infinite form, the operation and devel­
opment of the good. In this way the standpoint of the mere relationship between
the two, and the standpoint of the ought, is abandoned, and we have passed over
to ethical life. 4

C. Ethical Life
§513
Ethical life is the completion of objective mind, the truth of subjective and object­
ive mind itself. The one-sidedness of objective mind consists partly in having its
freedom immediately in reality, therefore in the external, the thing, partly in hav­
ing it in the good as an abstract universal. The one-sidedness of subjective mind
consists in its similarly abstract self-determination in its inward individuality
against the universal. 1 When these one-sidednesses are sublated, then subjective
freedom becomes the rational will, universal in and for itself, which has its aware­
ness of itself and the disposition in the consciousness of individual subjectivity,
and at the same time has its operation and immediate universal actuality as cus­
tom, -self-consciousfreedom become nature.2

§514
The substance aware of itself as free, in which the absolute ought is being as well,
has actuality as the spirit of a people. 1 The abstract diremption of this spirit is
individualization intopersons, of whose independence the spirit is the inner power
and necessity. 2 But the person, as thinking intelligence, is aware of that substance
as his own essence, ceases in this disposition to be an accident of substance; he
views substance, his absolute final end in actuality, as something already achieved
in the here and now, yet also produces this end by his activity, but produces it
as something that simply is. Thus without reflective choice the person fulfils his
duty as his own and as something that is and in this necessity he has himself and
his actual freedom.3

§515
Because the substance is the absolute unity of individuality and the universal­
ity of freedom, the actuality and activity of each individual, in being for himself
and caring /or himself, is conditioned by the presupposed whole in the context
of which alone it occurs, but is also a transition into a universal product. 1 -The
disposition of the individuals is awareness of the substance and of the identity of
all their interests with the whole; and when the other individuals are actual and
reciprocally aware of themselves only in this identity, this is trust, -the genuine,
ethical disposition. 2

Ethical Life

229

§51 6
The relations o f rhe individual i n the relationships to which rhe substance partic­
ularizes itself constitute his ethical duties. Ethical personality, i.e. the subjectivity
which is permeated by the substantial life, is virtue. 1 In relation to external imme­
diacy, to a stroke of fate, virtue is an attitude to being as to something that is
not negative, and is thereby calm repose wirhin itself; - in relation to substantial
objectivity, to the whole of ethical actuality, virtue, as trust, is deliberate work for
this objectivity and the capacity of sacrificing itself for it; -in relation to the con­
tingency of relationships with others, it is first justice and rhen an inclination of
benevolence; in rhis sphere, and in its attitude to its own reality and bodiliness,
the individuality expresses its particular character, temperament, etc. as virtues. 2

§517
The erhical substance is:
(a) as immediate or natural spirit, -thefamily;
(b) the relative totality of the relative relations of individuals as independent
persons to one anorher in a formal universality, -civil society;1
(c) the self-conscious substance, as rhe spirit developed to an organic actual­
ity, -the political constitution. 2

(a) THE FAMIL Y

§518
The ethical spirit, when in its immediacy, contains the natural moment that the
individual has its substantial reality in its natural universality, the genus, -rhe
sexual relationship, but elevated to a spiritual determination; - rhe unity of love
and the disposition of intimate trust; -spirit as family is sensitive spirit. 1

§519
( 1 ) The difference of the natural sexes also appears at the same time as a dif­
ference of intellectual and ethical determination.1 These personalities combine,
in accordance with their exclusive individuality, to form one person; subjective
intimacy determines them to substantial unity, makes this union into an eth­
ical relationship- marriage.2 The substantial intimacy makes marriage into an
undivided bond of persons- monogamous marriage; the physical union is a con­
sequence of the ethically formed bond.3 The further consequence is community
of personal and particular interests.

§520
(2) The property of the family as one person acquires, in virtue of the community
in which the various individuals constituting the family all stand in relation to

this property, an ethical interest,

as

do also the income, the labour and provision

§521
The ethical requirements connected with the natural generation of children and
initially posited as primary (§5 1 9) in the contracting of marriage, are realized in
the second birth of the children, their spiritual birth, -in educating them to be
independent persons. 1

§522
(3) In virtue of this independence, the children leave the concrete vitality of
the family to which they originally belong, they have become for themselves, but
destined to found another such actual family. Marriage succumbs to dissolution
by the natural moment contained in it, the death of husband and wife; but the
intimacy too, as the merely sensitive substantiality, is in itself subject to chance
and transience. By this sort of contingency, the members of the family become
persons in their relationship to each other; and in this way there enters for the first
time into this bond something in itself foreign to it, legal regulations. 1
(b) CIVIL S O CIE TY

§523
The substance, as spirit, particularizes itself abstractly into manypersom (the fam­
ily is only a single person), into families or individuals, which, in independent
freedom and as particulars, are for themselves. It thus initially loses its ethic­
al determination, since these persons as such have in their consciousness and as
their aim not the absolute unity, but their own particularity and their being-for­
self, - the system of atomism. In this way the substance becomes only a uni­
versal mediating interconnection of independent extremes and their particular
interests. The internally developed totality of this interconnection is the state as
civil society or as external state. 1

(a) The System of Needs

§524
( 1 ) First of all , the particularity of persons comprises their needs. The possib­
ility of satisfYing these needs is here situated in the social system, the general
resources from which all obtain their satisfaction. In the state of affairs in which
this standpoint of mediation is realized, immediate seizure (§488) of external

Ethical Life

23 1

objects as means to satisfaction no longer occurs, or very rarely; the objects are
property. Their acquisition is, on the one hand, conditioned and mediated by the
will of their possessors, which, as particular will, has as its aim the satisfaction
of variously determined needs, just as, on the other hand, it is conditioned and
mediated by the ever renewed production of exchangeable means by one's own
labour, this mediation of satisfaction by the labour of all constitutes the general
resources. 1

§525
(2) Universality sh i nes i n to the particularity of need� i nitially i n the followi ng
way: the intellect draws distinctions among needs and thereby multiplies indefin­
itely both the needs themselves and the means for these different needs, making
the needs and the means ever more abstract; this individualization of the con­
tent by abstraction gives rise to the division oflabour. 1 This habit of abstraction
in enjoyment, information, knowledge, and behaviour constitutes culture in this
sphere, -formal culture in general.2

§526
Labour too thus becomes more abstract, and leads on the one hand by its uni­
formiry to ease of labour and to increased production, on the other hand to
restriction to one skill, and thus to a more unconditional dependence on the
social system. The skill itself becomes in this way mechanical, and develops to
the point where the machine can take the place of human labour. 1

§527
(3) But the concrete division of the general resources, which are also a univer­
sal business, 1 among the particular masses determined by the moments of the
concept, each of which masses possesses its own basis of subsistence and, in con­
nexion with that, corresponding modes of labour, of needs, and of means for
satisfYing them, moreover of aims and interests, as well as of spiritual culture
and habit, gives rise to the difference ofestates.2-lndividuals allocate themselves
to estates according to natural talent, according to skill, choice and chance. In
belonging to such a determinate, stable sphere, they have their actual existence,
which as existence is essentially a particular existence, and in this existence they
have their ethic of integrity, their recognition and their honour.3
[Remark] Where there is civil society, and with it the state, there arise estates
distinct from each other; for the universal substance, in its vitality, exists only so
far as it organically particularizes itself; the history of constitutions is the history
of the development of these estates, of the legal relationships of individuals to
them, and of these estates to one another and to their centre.4

232

Objective Mind

§528
The substantial, natural estate has a natural and stable wealth in the fruitful
ground and soil; its activity gets direction and content through determinations of
nature, and its ethical life is grounded in faith and trust.1 The second, the reflected
estate has to rely on the wealth of society, on the element subject to mediation,
representation, and an ensemble of contingencies; the individual has to rely on
his subjective skill, talent, intellect, and diligence.2 The third, thinking estate
has for its business the universal interests; like the second it has a subsistence
mediated by its own skill, and like the first a secure subsistence, but secured by
the whole of society. 3

(�) Administration ofjustice
§529
When developed to the system mediated by natural need and free choice, to
universal relationships of the system and to a process of external necessity, the
principle of contingent particularity has within it initially formal right, as the
determination, stable for itself, of freedom.1 ( 1 ) The actualization appropriate
to right in this sphere of intellectual consciousness is that it be brought to con­
sciousness as the stable universal, that it be known and posited in its determinacy
as what is valid;- the law. 2
[Remark] The positive aspect of laws concerns only their form, in general the fact
that they are in force and known, which at the same time makes it possible for
them to be known by all in an ordinary, external way. The content here may be
rational in itself or perhaps irrational and so wrong.3 But when right, in the pro­
cess of determinate realization, is a developed right and its content analyses itself
in order to gain determinacy, then this analysis, because of the finitude of the
material, falls into the progression of bad infinity; thefinal determinacy, which is
utterly essential and breaks off this progression of unreality, can in this sphere of
the finite be attained only in a way involving contingency and discretion; whether
three years, ten thalers, etc., or only 2 k , 2�, 2 � years, and so on ad infinitum,
be the right amount, can by no means be decided from the concept, and yet the
higher demand is that it be decided. Hence on the side of external reality, positiv­
ity in the form of contingency and discretion automatically enter into right, but
of course only when determining comes to an end. This happens and has always
automatically happened in all legislations; all that is needed is to have a determin­
ate consciousness of it, in contrast to the supposed goal and chatter: that law can
and should be, at every point, determined by reason or legal intellect, by purely
rational and intellectual grounds. To have such an expectation and to make such
a demand of the sphere of the finite is the empty idea ofperfection. 4
There are people for whom laws are actually an evil and profanity, and who
regard governing and being governed from natural love, hereditary divinity or

Ethical Life

233

nobility, by faith and trust, as the genuine condition, while the reign of laws is a
corrupt and unjust condition. They overlook the circumstance that the stars, etc.,
and cattle as well, are governed, and well governed too, by laws-laws, however,
which are only internally in these objects, not for them, not laws that are posited,
whereas what makes man man is awareness of his law, and he can therefore genu­
inely obey only such known law, just as his law can only be a just law, if it is a
known law; otherwise it will inevitably be contingency and arbitrariness even in
its essential content, or at least mixed and polluted with them.5
The same empty requirement of perfection is employed for the opposite of the
above thesis, namely for the opinion that a legal code is impossible or impractic­
able. This introduces the additional absurdity of putting the essential and uni­
versal regulations in the same class as the particular detail. The finite material
is determinable to bad infinity; but this advance is not, as it is represented in
e.g. space, a generation of spatial determinations of the same quality as those
preceding them, but an advance into greater and ever greater specificity by the
acumen of the analysing intellect, inventing new distinctions, which make new
decisions necessary. If the determinations of this sort may equally be called either
new decisions or new laws, then the interest and import of these determinations
decreases proportionately as this development proceeds. They fall within the sub­
stantial, universal laws already in place, as improvements to a floor, a door, etc.,
fall within the house and are indeed something new, but not a house. If the legis­
lation of an uncultured age has begun with individual regulations and constantly
increased their number in accordance with its nature, then there arises, with the
advance in this multiplicity, the contrary need for a simpler legal code, i.e. the
need to condense that mass of individual rules into their universal determina­
tions; to know how to find and express such determinations befits the intellect
and culture of a people. Such a gathering of individual rules into general forms,
which in fact first deserve the name of laws, has recently been begun in some
respects in England by the Minister Peel, who has thereby gained the gratitude,
even the admiration, ofhis countrymen.6

§530
(2) The positive form oflaws, being expressed and made known as laws, is a condi­
tion of the external obligation to obey them, since, being laws of strict right, they
concern only the abstract will, which is also in itself external, not the moral or
ethical will.1 The subjectivity to which the will has, in this respect, a right is here
only knowledge of the law. This subjective reality, since it is the reality of what is
in and for itself in this sphere, the reality of right, is at the same time an externally
objective reality, as universal validity and necessity.2
The legality of property and of private actions concerning it obtains its uni­
versal guarantee through formalities, in accordance with the determination that
legality is something posited, recognized, and thereby in force. 3

§53 1
(3) Legality acquires the necessity, to which the objective reality determines itself,
in the administration ofjustice. 1 Right-in-itself has to present itself to the court,
to the individualized right, as proven. Here a distinction can be drawn between
right-in-itself and provable right. The coun decides and acts in the interest of
right as such, deprives the existence of right of its contingency, and in panicular
transforms this existence, when it takes the form of revenge, into punishment.
(§500)2
[Remark] The comparison of the two types, or rather two moments, of the
persuasion of j udges about the facts of an action in relation to the accused, on
the basis of the mere circumstances and testimony of others alone or on the
basis of the funher required addition of the defendant's confession, constitutes
the main issue in the question of what are called jury-courts. It is an essential
determination that the two components of a judicial decision, the judgement
about the facts and the judgement as application of the law to them, are, since
they are different aspects in themselves, exercised as different JUnctions. By the
institution mentioned they are assigned even to bodies differently qualified, from
one of which individuals belonging to the official judiciary are expressly
excluded. Taking this distinction of functions as far as this separation in the
couns rests rather on considerations that are not essential; the main point remains
only the separate performance of these intrinsically different functions.3-A
more imponant issue is whether the accused's confession to the crime is to be
made a condition of a penal sentence or not. The institution of the jury-coun
abstracts from this condition. The point is that cenainty, especially in this area,
is inseparable from truth; but confession is to be regarded as producing the
highest degree of assurance, which by its nature is subjective. The final decision
therefore lies in the confession. On this point therefore the accused has an
absolute right to the conclusiveness of the proof and of the persuasion of the
judges. This moment is incomplete, because it is only one moment; but if the
other moment, proof from mere circumstances and testimony, is taken in
the same abstract way, it is still more imperfect; and the jurors are essentially
judges and deliver a judgement. In so far as they have to rely on such object­
ive proofs, but at the same time incomplete cenainty (incomplete in so far as
it is only in them) is allowed, the jury-coun involves the mixture and confu­
sion (properly belonging to barbaric times) of objective proofs and subjective,
so-called moral, cenainty.4-To declare extraordinary punishments an
absurdity is easy, or rather too shallow, in taking offence at a mere name. In
substance, this determination involves the difference between objective proof
with and objective proof without the moment of absolute assurance which lies
in confession. 5

§532
The administration of justice has the determination of activating to necessity
only the abstract side of the freedom of the person in civil society. But this
activation rests initially on the particular subjectivity of the judge, since the unity,
itself necessary, of this subjectivity with right-in-itself is not yet present here.
Conversely, the blind necessity of the system of needs is not yet elevated into
consciousness of the universal, and activated from such consciousness.1

(y) Police and Corporation
§533
The administration of justice automatically excludes that part of actions and
interests belonging only to particularity, and leaves to contingency not only the
occurrence of crimes but also regard for welfare. 1 In civil society the aim is the
satisfaction of need, and to satisfY it, since it is in fact the satisfaction of the man
as well, in a stable, universal way, i.e. the aim is to secure this satisfaction.2 But
the mechanism of the necessity of society involves, in a great variety of ways, the
contingency of this satisfaction. This is due to the variability of the needs them­
selves, in which opinion and subjective preference play a great part. It also results
from localities, the connections of a people with other peoples, from errors and
deceptions which can be introduced into individual parts of the whole clockwork
and are capable of throwing it into disorder-as also and in particular from the
limited capacity of the individual to acquire for himself a share of those gener­
al resources. The operation of this necessity at the same time also sacrifices the
particularities by which it is brought about; it does not, for itself, involve the
affirmative aim of securing the satisfaction of individuals. With regard to them, it
may be adequate or it may not, and here the individuals are, in their own eyes, the
morally justified end.3

§534
Consciousness of the essential aim, knowledge of the way in which the powers
and v:Kiable ingredients composing this necessity operate, and maintaining that
aim in those powers and against them, has, on the one hand, the relationship
of an external universality towards the concreteness of civil society; as an act­
ive power, this order is the external state, which, in so far as it is rooted in the
higher realm, the substantial state, appears as state police. 1 On the other hand, in
this sphere of particularity the aim of substantial universality and its activation
remains restricted to the business of particular branches and interests; - the cor­
poration, in which the particular citizen in his private capacity finds the security
of his resources, and equally emerges from his individual private interest and has a

236

conscious activity for a relatively universal end, j ust as in his legal and professional
duties he has his ethical code. 2

(c) THE S TA TE

§535
The state is the self-conscious ethical substance, -the unification of the principle
of the family and the principle of civil society. The same unity, which in the fam­
ily becomes the feeling of love, is the essence of the state, but this essence at the
same time acquires the form of conscious universality from the second principle of
conscious and spontaneously active willing. Conscious subjectivity has this uni­
versality, as well as the determinations of it which develop in knowledge, as its
content and absolute aim, i.e. for itself it wills this rationality. '

§536
The state is a) initially its internal structure as self-relating develop­
ment- internal state-law or the constitution;' it is �) a particular individual, and
thus in relationship with other particular individuals- externa/state law; 2 y) but
these particular spirits are only moments in the development of the universal Idea
ofspirit in its actuality: world history. 3
-

(a) Constitutional Law

§537
The essence of the state is the universal in and for itself, the rationality of the
will; but, as self-aware and self-activating, it is subjectivity pure and simple and,
as actuality, it is one individual. ' Its work generally-in relation to the extreme of
individuality as the multitude of individuals-consists in a double function. First
it maintains them as persons, thus making right a necessary actuality, then it pro­
motes their well-being, which each initially takes care of for himself, but which
has a thoroughly universal side; it protects the family and guides civil society. 2
Secondly, it brings back both of them, the family and civil society, and, the whole
disposition and activity of the individual-whose tendency is to become a centre
for himself-into the life of the universal substance and, in this sense, as a free
power it curtails those subordinate spheres and maintains them in substantial
immanence. 3

§538
Laws express the determinations of the content of objective freedom. First, for the
immediate subject, for his independent wilfulness and particular interest, they are
restrictions. But secondly they are an absolute final end and the universal work:

Ethical Life

237

hence they are produced by the functions of the various estates, which distill
themselves more and more out of the universal particularization, and by all the
activity and private concerns of individuals. Thirdly, laws are the substance of
individuals' free willing within their bounds and of their disposition and so are
displayed as prevailing custom. 1

§539
As a living spirit pure and simple, the state can only be an organized whole,
differentiated into particular agencies, which, proceeding from the one concept
(though not known as concept) of the rational will, continually produce it as their
result. 1 The constitution is this overall articulation of state-power. It involves the
determinations of the way in which the rational will-in so far as in individuals
it is only in itselfthe universal will-firstly, comes to consciousness and under­
standing of itself and is found, and is, secondly, posited in actuality, through
the agency of the government and its particular branches, and maintained in
actuality, and also protected against the contingent subjectivity both of these gov­
ernmental departments and of individuals. The constitution is existentjustice, as
the actuality offreedom in the development of all its rational determinations.2
[Remark] Freedom and equality are the simple categories in which what should
constitute the fundamental determination and the final goal and result of the
constitution is frequently summarized. However true this is, the defect of these
determinations is first of all that they are entirely abstract: adhered to in this form
of abstraction, they are what prevents the concrete, i.e. an articulation of the state,
i.e. a constitution and a government, from arising at all, or else destroys them.
With the state there enters inequality, the distinction between governing powers
and the governed, officials, authorities, directories, etc. The consistent principle
of equality rejects all distinctions, and thus allows no sort of political condition
to subsist. -The determinations of freedom and equality are in fact the founda­
tions of this sphere, but being the most abstract they are also the most superficial,
and for that very reason they are apt to be the most familiar. It is of interest there­
fore to study them somewhat more closely. 3
First regarding equality, the familiar proposition that all men are by nature
equal, involves a misunderstanding: it confuses the natural with the concept. We
must rather say that by nature men are only unequal. But the concept of freedom,
as it initially exists as the concept, without further determination and devel­
opment, is abstract subjectivity as a person, who is capable of property (§488) .
This single abstract determination of personality constitutes the actual equality
of human beings. But that this freedom is present, that it is man (and not as in
Greece, Rome, etc. only some men) that is recognized and legally regarded as a
person, is not by nature at all; it is only a result and product of the consciousness
of the deepest principle of mind, and of the universality and cultivation of this
consciousness. 4 That the citizens are equal before the law contains a great truth,
-

238

Objective Mind

but a truth that, when expressed in this way, is a tautology; for what it expresses
is only the lawfol condition in general, that the laws rule. But, as regards the
concrete, apart from their personality the citizens are equal before the law only
in those respects in which they are in any case equal outside the law. Only the
equality that is otherwise (in whatever way it may be) contingently present, equal­
ity in wealth, age, physical strength, talent, skill, etc., or even in crimes, can
and should justifY equal treatment of them before the law in the concrete-as
regards taxation, military service, admission to the civil service, etc., punishment,
etc. The laws themselves, except in so far as they concern that narrow sphere
of personality, presuppose unequal conditions and determine the unequal legal
responsibilities and duties resulting therefrom.s
As regards freedom, it is most immediately taken partly in a negative sense
against the wilfulness of others and lawless treatment, partly in the affirmative
sense of subjective freedom; but subjective freedom is given great scope both for
one's own wilfulness and activity for one's particular ends, and as regards the
claim to one's own insight and to active involvement and participation in public
affairs.6 Formerly the legally determined rights, private as well as public rights, of
a nation, town, etc. were called its freedoms. In fact every genuine law is a free­
dom, for it involves a rational determination of objective mind, and so a content
of freedom. By contrast, nothing has become more common than the idea that
each of us must restrict our freedom in relation to the freedom of others, and
the state is the condition in which this reciprocal restriction occurs, and the laws
are the restrictions. In ideas of this son freedom is conceived only as contingent
preference and wilfulness.?-Thus it has also been said that modern peoples are
capable only of equality, or more capable of equality than of freedom, and for
no other reason than that, with an assumed definition of freedom (chiefly the
participation of all in the affairs and actions of the state), it was impossible to
find one's way in actuality-which is more rational and at the same time more
powerful than abstract presuppositions.8-0n the contrary, it has to be said that
it is just the great development and cultivation of modern states that produces
the supreme concrete inequality of individuals in actuality, whereas, through the
deeper rationality of laws and reinforcement of the lawful condition, it brings
about a freedom that is all the greater and more firmly entrenched, a freedom that
it can allow and tolerate. Even the superficial distinction involved in me words
freedom and equality points to the fact that freedom tends to inequality; but the
usual concepts of freedom proceed in the reverse direction, back to equality. But
the more we reinforce freedom, as security of property, as the possibility of devel­
oping and exercising, etc., one's talents and good qualities, the more it appears
to become a matter of course; then the consciousness and estimation of freedom
especially turns towards the subjective sense of freedom. This is the freedom of
the activity that ventures in every direction and devotes itself at pleasure to par­
ticular and to universal spiritual interests, this is the independence of individual
particularity, as well as the inward freedom in which the subject has principles, an

Ethical Life

239

insight and conviction of its own, and thus gains moral independence. But firstly
this very freedom involves for itself the supreme cultivation of the particularity of
that in which men are unequal and make themselves still more unequal by this
education; and, secondly, it only arises under conditions of objective freedom,
and has grown, and could grow, to such a height only in modern states. If, with
this cultivation of particulariry, there is an interminable increase in the number
of needs and the difficulty of satisfYing them, in quibbling and smart alecks and
their insatisfied vanity, this belongs to emancipated particularity, which is left to
get into all possible complications of its own making in its sphere and to deal with
them in its own way. This sphere is of course also the field of restrictions, because
freedom is caught up in naturalness, partiality and wilfulness, and thus has to
restrict itself; it has to do this too, of course, in view of the naturalness, partiality
and wilfulness of others, but it has to do so especially and essentially in view of
rational freedom.9
But as regards political freedom, we take this in the sense of formal participa­
tion in the public affairs of state by the will and active involvement even of those
individuals who otherwise make their chief function the particular aims and deal­
ings of civil society. It has become fairly common to call a constitution only the
side of the state which concerns such participation of these individuals in uni­
versal affairs, and to regard a state in which this does not formally occur, as a
state without a constitution. What we have to say about this meaning is initially
just this: by constitution we must understand the determination of rights, i.e.
offreedoms in general, and the organization of their actualization, and political
freedom can in any case only constitute a pan of the constitution. The following
paragraphs will deal with the constitution.1 0

§540
The guarantee of a constitution, i.e. the necessity that the laws be rational and
their actualization secured, lies in the spirit of the whole people, namely in the
determinacy by which the people has the self-consciousness of its reason. (Reli­
gion is this consciousness in its absolute substantiality.) And then the guarantee
lies at the same time in the development of that principle, in an actual organiz­
ation conforming to this self-consciousness. The constitution presupposes this
consciousness of the spirit, and conversely the spirit presupposes the constitution;
for the actual spirit itself only has a determinate consciousness of its principles, in
so far as they are present for it as existent. 1
[Remark] The question: 'To whom, to which authority and how organized,
belongs the power to make a constitution?' is the same as the question: 'Who
has to make the spirit of a people?' If one separates the idea of a constitution
from the idea of the spirit, as if the spirit exists or has existed without
possessing a constitution conformable to it, such an opinion demonstrates
only the superficiality of the thought about the connection between the spirit,

240

Objective Mind

its consciousness about itself and its actuality. What is thus called making a
constitution, has, owing to this inseparability, never occurred in history, no
more than the making of a code of laws. A constitution has only developed from
the spirit identically with that spirit's own development, and has run through,
together with the spirit, the conceptually necessary alterations and stages of
formation. It is history and the indwelling spirit (and, in fact, history is only the
history ofspirit) by which constitutions have been and are made. 2

§541
The living totality, the preservation, i.e. the continual production of the state in
general and of its constitution, is the government. The naturally necessary organ­
ization is the emergence of the family and of the estates of civil society. The
government is the universal part of the constitution, i.e. the part that has the
preservation of those parts as its intentional aim, but at the same time apprehends
and activates the universal aims of the whole which stand above the determin­
ation of the family and of civil society. The organization of the government is
likewise its differentiation into powers, according to the way in which their pecu­
liar features are determined by the concept but in the subjectivity of the concept
interpenetrate so as to form an actual unity. 1
[Remark] Since the immediate categories of the concept are those of universal­
ity and individuality, and their relationship is that of subsumption of individuality
under universality, it has come about that in the state legislative and executive
power have been differentiated, but in such a way that the legislative exists for
itselfas the absolutely supreme power, while the executive is divided again into
governmental or administrative power and judicial power, according as the laws
are applied to universal or private affairs. The division of these powers has been
regarded as the essential relationship, in the sense of their independence of each
other in existence, but with the above-mentioned connection of subsumption of
the powers of the individual under the power of the universal. 2 In these determ­
inations the elements of the concept are unmistakeable, but they are combined
by the intellect into a relationship of irrationality, instead of into the living spir­
it's joining-together-with-itself. That the functions of the universal interests of
the state should be, in their necessary distinctness, also organized separately from
each other-this division is the one absolute moment of the depth and actuality
of freedom; for freedom only has depth when it is developed into its differences
and has attained to the existence of these differences. But to make the business
of legislation an independent power (and especially with the idea that a con­
stitution and the fundamental laws first have to be made at some time-in an
environment, which includes an already existing development of differences) ,
and in fact the first power, with the specific determination of the participation
of everyone in it, and to make the governmental power a power dependent on
it and only executive, -this presupposes that the knowledge is lacking that the

Ethical Life

24 1

true Idea and so the living and spiritual actuality is the concept that joins togeth­
er with itself and thus the subjectivity that contains universality in it as only one
of its moments. Individuality is the first and the supreme pervasive determination
in the organization of the state. Only through the governmental power, and by
its comprehending in itself the particular functions (including too the legislat­
ive function, which is itself particular, abstractfor itselft, is the state one. - Here,
as everywhere else, the rational relationship of the logical is essential and exclus­
ively true, in contrast to the external relationship of the intellect, which never
gets beyond subsuming the individual and particular under the universal. What
disorganizes the unity of the logical-rational, equally disorganizes actuality.3

§542
In the government as an organic totality there is ( 1 ) subjectivity as the infin­
ite unity of the concept with itself in its development; the all-sustaining, all­
resolving will of the state, the highest pinnacle of the state and its all-pervasive
unity-the princely governmental power. In the perfect form of the state, in
which all moments of the concept have reached their free existence, this sub­
jectivity is not a so-called moral person, or resolutions issuing from a majority
(forms in which the unity of the resolving will has no actual existence) but, as
actual individuality, the will of one resolving individual, - monarchy. The mon­
archical constitution is therefore the constitution of developed reason: all oth­
er constitutions belong to lower stages of the development and realization of
reason.1
[Remark] The unification of all concrete state-powers in one existence, as in the
patriarchal system or as in a democratic constitution, in the participation of all
in all affairs, conflicts for itself with the principle of the division of powers, i.e.
the developed freedom of the moments of the Idea. But equally the division, the
elaboration of the moments advanced to a free totality, must be restored to ideal
unity, i.e. to subjectivity. The cultivated differentiation, the realization, of the Idea
essentially involves the growth of this subjectivity, as a real moment, to actual
existence; and this actuality can only be the individuality of the monarch-the
subjectivity of abstract, final decision present in one person. All those forms of
collective resolving and willing, supposedly to emerge from the atomism of indi­
vidual wills by counting them up in a democratic or aristocratic way, have the
unreality of an abstraction clinging to them. Only two determinations matter,
the necessity of a moment of the concept and the form of its actuality. Only the
nature of the speculative concept can genuinely settle this question. -This sub­
jectivity, since it is the moment of abstract decision in general, proceeds firstly
to the determination that the name of the monarch appears as the external bond
and sanction under which anything whatsoever is done in the government, and
secondly that, as simple relation to itself, it has within it the determination of

242

Objective Mind

immediacy, and thus of nature, and with this the determination of individuals for
the dignity of the princely power is established by heredity.2

§543
(2) In the particular governmental power there emerges, first, the division of
state business into its previously determined branches, the legislative power, the
administration of justice or judicial power, the administration and police power,
etc., and also the distribution of these powers to particular authorities, which,
being dependent on the laws for their functions, on this score and for this reason,
possess independence of action, while at the same time they stand under higher
supervision.1 Secondly, there arises the participation of several in state business,
who together constitute the universal estate (§528) in so far as they make the
management of universal ends the essential determination of their particular life;
the ulterior condition for being able to participate individually in this manage­
ment is training and aptitude for it. 2

§544
The council of the estates is concerned with the participation, of everyone who
belongs to civil society in general and is in this respect a private person, in the
governmental power, and in fact in legislation, namely in the universality of those
interests which do not (like peace and war) involve the emergence and action of
the state as an individual, and therefore do not belong exclusively to the nature
of the princely power for itself. By virtue of this participation, subjective freedom
and fancy and their universal opinion show themselves in an existent effectiveness
and enjoy the satisfaction of counting for something. 1
[Remark] The division of constitutions into democracy, aristocracy and monarchy
is still the most determinate statement of their difference in relation to state
power. They must at the same time be regarded as necessary formations in the
course of development, and thus in the history, of the state. Hence it is super­
ficial and foolish to represent them as an object of choice. The pure forms of
their necessity are, in so far as they are finite and temporary, connected both with
forms of their degeneration, ochlocracy, etc., and with earlier transitio nal forms.
The latter two forms are not to be confused with the genuine formations. Thus,
it may be that, because of the similarity that the will of one individual stands at
the summit of the state, oriental despotism is comprised under the vague name
of monarchy, -as also feudal monarchy, to which even the favoured name of
constitutional monarchy cannot be denied. The true difference of these forms
from genuine monarchy depends on the content of the prevailing principles of
right which have their actuality and guarantee in the state-power. These prin­
ciples are those developed in earlier spheres, the principles of freedom of property
and also of personal freedom, the principles of civil society, of its industry and of

Ethical Life

243

the communities, and of the regulated performance of the particular authorities
subject to the laws. 2
The question which is most discussed is in what sense we are to conceive the
participation of private persons in state affairs. For the members of the estate­
assemblies are initially to be taken as private persons, whether they are treated as
individuals for themselves or as representatives of a large group or of the people.
The aggregate of private persons is often called the people; but as such an aggreg­
ate it is vulgus, not populus; and in this regard it is the sole aim of the state that
a people should not come to existence, to power and action, as such an aggregate.
Such a condition of a people is the condition of lawlessness, ethical impover­
ishment, of general irrationality: in this condition the people would be only a
shapeless, wild, blind force, like that of the stormy, elemental sea, which does
not, however, destroy itself, as the people-a spiritual element-would do. We
have often heard such a condition represented as that of true freedom. If there
is to be any sense in engaging in the question of the participation of private per­
sons in public affairs, we must presuppose not the irrational mass, but an already
organized people, i.e. a people in which a governmental power is present.3-But
the advantage of such participation is not to be located in the superiority of par­
ticular insight in general that private persons are supposed to possess over state
officials- the contrary is necessarily the case-nor in the superiority of good will
for the universal benefit: the members of civil society are rather the sort of people
who make their particular interest and, especially in feudal society, the interest
of their privileged corporation their immediate determination. Take the case
of England which, because private persons have a predominant participation in
state affairs, has been regarded as having the freest of all constitutions. Experience
shows that this countty-as compared with the other culturally advanced states
of Europe-is the most backward in civil and criminal legislation, in the right
and the freedom of property, in arrangements for art and science, etc., and that
objective freedom, i.e. rational right, is rather sacrificed to formal right and to par­
ticular private interest, and this happens even in the institutions and possessions
supposedly dedicated to religion. 4 The advantage of a share for private persons
in public affairs is to be located partly in their more concrete, and therefore more
urgent, sense of universal needs, but essentially in the right of the communal spir­
it to make its appearance as an externally universal will in an orderly and express
activity for public concerns. This satisfaction breathes new life into the commu­
nal spirit, and at the same time fresh life flows into the administrative authorities,
who thus have it kept present in their consciousness that they not only have to
exact duties but just as essentially to pay regard to rights. Private citizens are in
the state the incomparably greater number; in fact they are a collection of people
who are recognized as persons. Therefore volitional reason displays its existence
in them as a multitude of free individuals, or in a universality of reflexion, whose
actuality is assured by a share in the state power. But it has already been noted as
a moment of civil society (§§527, 534) that the individuals ascend from external
-

Objective Mind

244

universality to substantial universality, namely as a particular kind- the
and it is not in the inorganic form of individuals as such (in the

estates;
democratic mode

of election) , but as organic moments, as estates, that they take up that share; a
power or activity in the state must never appear and act in a formless, inorganic
shape, i.e. on the principle of plurality and number. 5
Assemblies of estates have been designated as the

legislative power.

This is

already mistaken, in this respect: they constitute only one branch of this power, a
branch in which the particular government authorities have an essential share,
while the princely power has the absolute share of final decision. Anyway, in
a culturally advanced state, moreover, legislation can only be a refinement of
the laws in force, and so-called new laws can only be extremes of detail and
particularities (cf.

§529 Remark) , the content of which has been already prepared

by the practice of the law-courts or even provisionally decided. The so-called

finance law,

in so far as it comes up for the eo-determination of the estates,

is essentially a

government

matter, it is only improperly called a

law,

in the

general sense of comprising a wide, indeed the whole, range of the external
means of government. Although the finances concern the aggregate of needs,
the needs themselves are by their nature only

particular,

variable needs, ever

recurring anew. If the main component of the requirement were regarded as
continuing-as it very likely is- the determination of it would have more the
nature of a law; but to be a law it would have to be made once and for all, and
not made annually, or every few years, from scratch. The portion which varies
according to time and circumstances concerns in fact the smaller part of the
amount, and the determination of it has proportionately less of the character of a
law; and yet it is, and can be, only this slight variable part which is controversial,
and can be subject to a variable yearly determination, a determination that thus
falsely bears the high-sounding name of the

grant of the budget, i.e.

of the

whole

of the finances. The inadequacy of a law to be made each year and for one year
is clear even to plain common sense, which distinguishes the universal in and
for itself, as content of a genuine law, from a universality of reflexion, which
embraces only externally what is by its nature manifold. The name of a

law

for the annual fixing of financial requirements only serves, in the case of the
presupposed separation of legislative from governmental power, to s_ustain the
illusion that this separation actually obtains, and to conceal the fact that the
legislative power, when it decides about finances, is in fact dealing with what is
strictly government business.6- But the importance attached to the power of
granting the budget again and again anew, namely that the assembly of estates
possesses in it a

meam ofcoercion

against the government, and thus a guarantee

against injustice and violence- this importance is on the one hand a superficial
semblance, in that the financial arrangement necessary for the state's

survival

cannot be made to depend on any other circumstances, nor can the state's
survival be put in doubt every year; no more than the government could, e.g. ,
grant and arrange the organization of the administration of justice always for

Ethical Life

a limited time only, in order to reserve for itself, in the threat of suspending
the activity of this institution and in the fear of the emergence of a state of
brigandage, a means of coercing private individuals. But on the other hand
ideas of a relationship, in which it could be useful and indispensable to have
in one's hands a means of coercion, are panly based on the false idea of a
contractual relationship between government and people, and partly presuppose
the possibility of such a divergence in spirit between the two as would put
constitution and government quite out of the question. If we envisage the
emergence into existence of the empty possibility of getting any relief by such
means of coercion, such relief would rather be the disruption and dissolution of
the state: there would no longer be any government, only parries, and the only
remedy for it would be the domination and suppression of one pany by the other.
To represent organization of the state as a mere intellectual constitution, i.e. as
the mechanism of a balance of powers external to each other in their interior, goes
against the fundamental Idea ofwhat a state is. 7

§545
The final aspect of the state is that it is the immediate actuality of an individu­
al and naturally determined people.1 As a single individual the state is exclusive
against other such individuals. In their relationship to each other, wilfulness and
contingency obtain, because, owing to the autonomous totality of these persons,
between them the universal of right only ought to be, it is not actual. This inde­
pendence makes dispute between them a relationship of violence, a state of war,
for which the universal estate in the community determines itself to the panicular
end of maintaining the state's independence against other states, determines itself
to the estate of valour.2

§546
Warfare shows the substance of the state in its individuality proceeding to
abstract negativity, as the power in which the panicular independence of
individuals and their condition of absorption in the external reality of possession
and in natural life feels itself as a nullity, as the power which mediates
the maintenance of the universal substance by the sacrifice, taking place in
their heans, of this natural and panicular reality, by vanquishing the vanity
confronting it. I

(�) External Public Law
§547
By warfare the independence of states is put at risk, and in one respect the mutu­
al recognition of free national individualities is brought about (§430) , and by

246

Objective Mind

peace-settlements, supposed to last forever, both this universal recognition and
the particular entitlements of peoples with regard to each other, are established. 1

External public law is based partly on these positive treaties, but to that extent it
contains only rights that lack genuine actuality (§545); and it is based partly on
so-called international law, the universal principle of which is the presupposed
recognition of states and therefore restricts their otherwise unrestrained actions
agai nst one another in such a way that the possibility of peace remains. It also dis­
tinguishes between the state and individuals as private persons, and in general it is
based on customs. 2

( y) World History
§548
The determinate spirit of a people, since it is actual and its freedom is as nature,
has on this natural side the moment of geographical and climatic determinacy; it
is in time and, as regards content, essentially has a particular principle and has to
go through a development, determined by this principle, of its consciousness and
its actuality; it has a history within itself. 1 As a limited spirit its independence is a
subordinate matter; the spirit passes over into universal world-history, the events
of which display the dialectic of the particular national spirits, the judgement of

the world.2

§549
This movement is the path of liberation for the spiritual substance, the deed
by which the absolute final aim of the world is realized in the world, by which
the spirit that is at first only in itself makes its way to consciousness and self­
consciousness and thus to the revelation and actuality of its essence, the essence
that is in and for itself, and also sees itself become the externally universal spirit,
the world-spirit. 1 As this development is in time and in reality and thus takes the
form of history, its individual moments and stages are the national spirits; each
spirit, being individual and natural in a qualitative determinacy, is destined to
occupy only one stage, and accomplish only one task in the whole deed. 2
[Remark] That the presupposition is made, in the case of history, of an aim that
is in and for itself, and of the determinations that develop from that aim accord­
ing to the concept, is called an a priori view of history, and philosophy has been
reproached with writing history a priori. On this point, and on history-writing in
general, we need to go into further detail. That a final aim lies in and for itself
at the basis of history, and essentially of world-history, that the aim has actually
been and is being realized in it- the plan of providence- , that in general reason
is in history, must for itself be settled philosophically, and thus as necessary in
and for itself.3 What deserves censure can only be the presupposition of arbitrary
representations or thoughts and wanting to find and represent events and deeds

Ethical Life

247

in conformity with them. But nowadays the people who have incurred particular
responsibility for this son of a priori procedure are those who profess to want to
be pure historians, and who at the same time occasionally declare their oppos­
ition expressly to philosophizing, both in general and in history. Philosophy is
to them a troublesome neighbour, because it is an enemy of wilfulness and of
bright ideas. Such a priori history-writing has sometimes sprung up in quaners
where one would have least expected it, especially among classical scholars, and
in Germany more than in France and England, where historical writing has pur­
ified itself to a firmer and maturer character. The construction of fictions, such
as that of a primordial condition and its primordial people, which was in posses­
sion of the genuine knowledge of God and all sciences, 4 the fiction of sacerdotal
peoples,5 and, more specifically, e.g. the fiction of a Roman epic, which was the
source of the supposedly historical reports about the early history of Rome, etc., 6
has taken the place of the pragmatizing discoveries of psychological motives and
connections;? and in a wide circle it seems to be considered the prerequisite of
learned and ingenious historical writing, drawing from the sources, to concoct
such shallow ideas, and to combine them audaciously from a learned rubbish­
dump of remote, superficial circumstances, in defiance of the best-corroborated
history.
If we leave this subjective treatment of history aside, then the strictly oppos­
ite requirement, that history should not be considered in the light of an objective
aim, is on the whole equivalent to the seemingly even more justifiable require­
ment that the historian proceed with impartiality. This requirement tends to
be made in particular of the history ofphilosophy, which is supposed to show no
preference for an idea and opinion, j ust as a j udge should regard both of the con­
tending parties with equal disinterest. In the case of the judge it is at the same
time assumed that he would administer his office foolishly and badly, if he did
not have an interest, in fact an exclusive interest in justice, if he did not have
that for his aim and his sole aim, and if he abstained from judgement. We can
call this requirement on the j udge partiality for j ustice, and we know very well
here how to distinguish this from a subjective partiality.8 But in the case of the
impartiality required of the historian, this distinction disappears in the insipid,
self-satisfied chatter and both kinds of interest are rejected, if we require that the
historian should bring along no determinate aim and view by which to select,
arrange and assess events, but narrate them j ust in the contingent way in which he
finds them, in their unrelated and thoughtless particularity. This much is admit­
ted, that a history must have an object, e.g. Rome, its fortunes, or the decline of
the grandeur of the Roman empire. Little reflection is needed to see that this is
the presupposed aim which lies at the basis both of the events themselves and
of the assessment of them to decide which of these events have importance, i.e.
a closer or more remote relation to the aim. A history without such an aim and
without such an assessment would be only an idiotic effusion of the imagination,
not even a fairy tale, for even children expect some interest in their stories, i.e.

248

Objective Mind

at least a hint of an aim and the relation of events and actions to it.9 In the life
of a people the substantial aim is to be a state and to maintain itself as a state. A
people without state-formation (a nation as such) has, strictly speaking, no his­
tory, as the peoples existed before their formation of states and others still exist
now as savage nations. 1 0 What happens to a people, and takes place within it, has
its essential meaning in relation to the state; the mere particularities of individuals
are at the greatest distance from this object, an object belonging to history. It is
true that the universal spirit of an age in general leaves its imprint in the character
of the distinguished individuals of a period, and even their particularities are the
remoter and duller media in which the spirit still plays in fainter colours. Often,
even individual details of a minor occurrence, of a word, express not a subject­
ive particularity, but an age, a people, a culture, in striking vividness and brevity;
and to select such details is the task only of a historian of genius. Nevertheless,
the mass of other individual details is a superfluous mass, by the faithful accu­
mulation of which the objects worthy of history are overwhelmed and obscured.
The essential characterization of the spirit and its age is always contained in the
great events. It was an unerring sense that led to to the banishment of such por­
trayals of the particular, and the gleaning of its traits, into the novel (such as the
celebrated novels ofWalter Scort and the like); we must regard it as good taste to
combine the portrayal of the inessential, particular side of life with an inessential
material, such as the novel takes from private events and subjective passions. But
to weave the individual trivia of the age and the persons into the representation of
universal interests, in the interest of so-called truth, is not only against judgement
and taste, but against the concept of objective truth. It is involved in the sense of
objective truth that what is true for mind is only the substantial, not the trivial­
icy of external existences and contingencies, and that it is completely indifferent
whether such trifles are formally corroborated, or are, as in the novel, characterist­
ic inventions, ascribed to this or that name and circumstances. 1 1 -The interest
of Biography-to say a word on that here-seems directly opposed to a univer­
sal aim. But biography too has as its background the historical world, in which
the individual is involved; even a subjective idiosyncracy, a flash of humour, etc.
alludes to that substance and thereby increases its interest; but mere sentimental­
ity has another habitat and interest than history.
The requirement of impartiality addressed to the history ofphilosophy (arid also
addressed to the history of religion, both in general and also to church history)
generally implies an even more explicit exclusion of the presupposition of an
objective aim.12 Just now we designated the state as the point to which in political
history judgement has to relate events; so here the truth should be the object to
which the individual deeds and events of the spirit are to be related.1 3 But people
make the contrary presupposition, that the history of philosophy and of religion
are supposed to have as their content only subjective aims, i.e. only opinions and
representations, not the object that is in and for itself, not truth, and this for the
simple reason that there is no truth. On this assumption the interest in truth too

Ethical Life

249

appears only as a partiality in the usual sense, a partiality for opinions and repres­
entations, which are all of equal insubstantiality and all treated as indifferent. In
this way historical truth itself has the sense only of correctness, an accurate report
of externals, with no judgement except about this correctness itself, so that only
qualitative and quantitative j udgements are allowed, not judgements of necessity
and of the concept (cf. Remarks to §§ 1 72 and 1 78) .14 But in fact, if in political
history Rome or the German empire, etc. is an actual and genuine object and the
aim to which phenomena are to be related and by which they are to be assessed,
then it is even more the case that in universal history the universal spirit itself,
the consciousness of it and of its essence, is a genuine and actual object, content,
and an aim which all other phenomena serve in and for themselves, so that only
through their relationship to it, i.e. through the judgement in which they are sub­
sumed under it and it inheres in them, do they have their value and even their
existence. 1 5 That in the course of the spirit (and the spirit is a spirit that does not
just hover over history as over the waters, but weaves in it and is the sole moving
force) freedom, i.e. the development determined by the concept of spirit, is the
determinant and only its own concept is the spirit's final aim, i.e. truth, since the
spirit is consciousness, or in other words that reason is in history, will at least be a
plausible belief, but it is also a cognitive insight of philosophy. 16

§550
This liberation of spirit, in which it proceeds to come to itself and to actualize
its truth, and the task of this liberation, is the supreme and absolute right. 1 The
self-consciousness of a particular people is the bearer of the current stage of devel­
opment of the universal spirit in its embodiment and is the objective actuality in
which the spirit sets its will. The will of the other particular national spirits has
no rights against this absolute will, this people is the world-dominating people;
but equally the universal spirit strides beyond its current property, as a particular
stage, and then delivers it over to its chance and judgement.2

§551
While this task of actuality appears as an action, and therefore as the work, of
individuals, these individuals, as regards the substantial content of their labour,
are instruments, and their subjectivity, which is what is peculiar to them, is the
empty form of the activity. What they have gained for themselves therefore
through the individual share they have taken in the substantial task, a task
prepared and determined independently of them, is a formal universality of
subjective representation-thefame, which is their reward.1

§552
The spirit of a people involves the necessity of nature, and stands in external real­
ity (§483) ; the ethical substance is infinite within itself, but for itself a particular

250

Objective Mind

and limited substance (§§549 and 5 50) and its subjective side is encumbered
with contingency, unconscious custom, and consciousness of its content as a
temporal asset, standing in relationship to an external nature and world. But
it is the spirit thinking within the ethical substance that sublates within itself
the finitude that it has in virtue of being a national spirit, in its state and the
state's temporal interests, in the system of laws and customs. This thinking spir­
it ascends to awareness of itself in its essentiality, an awareness, however, which
itself has the immanent limitation of the national spirit. But the thinking spirit of
world history, when it sheds these limitations of the particular national spirits as
well as its own worldliness, grasps its concrete universality and ascends to aware­
ness ofthe absolute spirit, as the eternally actual truth in which rational awareness
is free for itself, and necessity, nature and history are only servants of its revelation
and vessels of its honour. 1
[Remark] We spoke of the formal aspect of mind's elevation to God in the Intro­
duction to the Logic (cf. particularly §5 1 Remark). -As regards the starting
points of this elevation, Kant has on the whole adopted the most correct starting
point, in so far as he regards belief in God as emerging from practical reason. For
a starting point implicitly contains the content or material which makes up the
content of the concept of God. But the genuine concrete material is neither being
(as in the cosmological proof) nor merely purposive activity (as in the physico­
theological proof) but the mind, whose absolute determination is efficacious reas­
on, i.e. the self-determining and self-realizing concept itself-freedom. 2 That the
elevation of subjective mind to God occurring in this determination is in Kant's
exposition again reduced to a postulate, to a mere ought, is the perversiry discussed
earlier, the immediate restoration of finitude's opposition, in whose sublation to
truth this elevation itself consists, as true and valid. 3
As regards the mediation in which the elevation to God consists, we have shown
earlier (§ 1 92; cf. §204 Remark) that the moment of negation deserves special
attention, since it is through negation that the essential content of the starting
point is purged of its finitude and in this way emerges freely. This moment was
abstract in its logical form, but it has now acquired its most concrete meaning.
The finite, from which we here set out, is the real ethical self-consciousness; the
negation through which this self-consciousness raises its spirit to its trutl), is the
purification, actually accomplished in the ethical world, of its knowledge from
subjective opinion, and the liberation of its will from the selfishness of desire.
Genuine religion and genuine religiosity emerge only from ethical life and they
are the ethical life at thought, i.e. becoming conscious of the free universality of
its concrete essence. Only from ethical life and by ethical life is the Idea of God
known as free spirit; it is therefore futile to look for genuine religion and religios­
ity outside the ethical spirit. 4
But as happens everywhere in the speculative, this emergence itself at the
same time acquires the ·meaning that what is initially set up as consequent and

Ethical Life

25 1

emergent is rather the absolute antecedent of that by which it is, on its appear­
ance, mediated, and here, in the realm of mind, it is also known as the truth of its
mediator.s
Here then is the place to go more deeply into the relationship between the state
and religion, and in doing so to elucidate the categories that are customary on the
topic. The immediate consequence of the foregoing is that ethical life is the state
drawn back into its substantial interior, while the state is the development and
actualization of ethical life, but that the substantiality of ethical life itself and of
the state is religion. According to this relationship, the state rests on the ethical
disposition, and this rests on the religious disposition. Since religion is the con­
sciousness of absolute truth, whatever is supposed to count as right and justice, as
duty and law, i.e. as true in the world of the free will, can only count in so far as
it is has a share in that truth, is subsumed under that truth and follows from it. But
if genuine ethics is to be a consequence of religion, then this requires that religion
have the genuine content, i.e. that the Idea of God known in it be the genuine
one. Ethical life is the divine spirit as indwelling in self-consciousness, in the actu­
al presence of self-consciousness as a people and the individual members of that
people; this self-consciousness retreating into itself out of its empirical actuality
and bringing its truth to consciousness, has in its faith and in its conscience only
what it has in the certainty of itself, in its spiritual actuality. The two are insep­
arable; there cannot be two sorts of conscience, a religious conscience and an
ethical conscience, differing from it in substance and content. But in respect of
form, i.e. for thinking and knowing (and religion and ethical life belong to intelli­
gence and are a type of thinking and knowing), the religious content, as the pure
truth that is in and for itself and thus supreme, wields a sanction over the eth­
ical life standing in empirical actuality; thus for self-consciousness religion is the
basis of ethical life and of the state. It has been the massive error of our times to
want to regard these inseparables as separable from one another, in fact even as
mutually indifferent. The view taken of the relationship of religion and the state
has been that the state already exists for itself in some other way and from some
force and power, while religion is the subjective affair of individuals and had to
be added, perhaps as something desirable only for strengthening the state, or is
even a matter of indifference, since the ethical life of the state, i.e. rational law
and constitution, stands firm for itself on its own ground.6 As the inseparability
of the two sides has been indicated, it is of interest to note the separation that
appears on the side of religion. It initially concerns the form, i.e. the relationship
of self-consciousness to the content of truth. Since this content is the substance,
the indwelling spirit, of self-consciousness in its actuality, self-consciousness has
in this content the certainty of itself and is free in the content. But there can
emerge, in respect to form, the relationship of unfreedom, even though the impli­
cit content of religion is absolute spirit. This great difference (to cite something
more determinate) is found within the Christian religion itself, in which it is not
the natural element that makes the content of God, nor does anything of the sort

Objective Mind

252

even enter as a moment into the substance of God; no, the content is God who
is known in the

spirit and in the truth. And yet in the catholic religion this spirit

is in actuality set in rigid opposition to the self-conscious spirit. First of all, in the

external thing. (In the Lutheran
enjoyment, i.e. in the annihilation of

host God is presented to religious worship as an
church, by contrast, only and solely in the

the externality of the host, and in thefaith, i.e. in the spirit that is at the same time
free and self-certain, only then is the host first consecrated and exalted to God
in his presence.) From that first and supreme relationship of externality flow all
the other external, hence unfree, unspiritual and superstitious relationships; espe­

laity, which receives knowledge of divine truth, as well as the direction of
wilt and conscience, from outside and from another class, a class that itself does not

cially a

gain possession of that knowledge in a spiritual way only, but essentially needs
an external consecration for it. And there is more: the style of praying, firstly
just moving the lips by themselves, then spiritless in that the subject foregoes the
direct approach to God and asks others to pray for him; addressing devotion to
miracle-working images, even to bones, and expecting miracles from them; in
general,

justification by external

works, a merit which is supposed to be gained by

actions, even supposed transferable to others, etc.-all this binds the spirit under
a

self-externality,

by which the concept of spirit is misconceived and perverted in

its innermost core, and right and justice, ethics and conscience, responsibility and
duty are corrupted at their root. 7
Corresponding to such a principle and to this development of spiritual unfree­
dom in the religious sphere there can only be a legislation and constitution of
legal and ethical unfreedom, and a condition of lawlessness and ethical depravity
in the actual state. Consistently with this, the Catholic religion has been loudly
praised and is still often praised as the only religion which secures the stability of
governments,-the son of governments in fact that are connected with institu­
tions based on the unfreedom of the spirit, the spirit that is supposed to be legally
and ethically free, based, that is, on institutions of injustice and on a condition
of ethical corruption and barbarism. But these governments are not aware that
in fanaticism they have a terrible power, a power that does not rise in hostility
against them only so long as and only on condition that they remain sunk under
the servitude of injustice and immorality. But in the mind there is still anoth­
er power available; against this self-externality and disintegration consciousness
gathers into its inner free actuality;

worldly wisdom awakens in the mind of gov­

ernments and peoples, i.e. wisdom in what in actuality is right and rational in
and for itself. The production of thinking and more specifically philosophy has
rightly been called

worldly wisdom,

for thinking presents the truth of the mind,

introduces the mind into the world, and thus liberates the mind in its actuality
and in its own self. s
The content thereby assumes an entirely different shape. The unfreedom of the
form, i.e. of awareness and subjectivity, has the consequence, for the ethical con­
tent, that self-consciousness is represented as not immanent in the content, that

Ethical Life

253

the content is represented as remote from self-consciousness, so that the content
is supposed to be genuine only as negative towards its actuality. In this untruth
the ethical content is called a holy thing. But the divine spirit's self-introduction
into actuality, the liberation of actuality to spirit, means that what in the world is
supposed to be holiness is displaced by ethical life. Instead of the vow of chastity,
only now does marriage rank as the ethical, and, therefore, the family as the
highest condition in this aspect of humanity. Instead of the vow of poverty (cor­
responding to which, embroiled in contradiction, is the merit of giving away
one's goods to the poor, i.e. enriching them) what counts is the activity of acquis­
ition by one's own intellect and industry, and honesty in this traffic and use of
wealth, ethical life in civil society. Instead of the vow of obedience, what matters
is obedience to the law and the legal arrangements of the state-an obedience that
is itself genuine freedom, because the state is one's own reason, self-actualizing
reason: ethical life in the state. Only so can right and morality then obtain.9 It
is not enough for religion to command: Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to
God what is God's. For the question is precisely to determine what is Caesar's, i.e.
what belongs to the worldly authority; and we know well enough everything the
worldly authority has wilfully arrogated to itself, just as for its part the spiritual
authority has done. The divine spirit must penetrate the worldly sphere imman­
ently, then wisdom is concrete within it, and the justification of worldliness is
determined in its own self. But this concrete indwelling is the aforesaid structures
of ethical life, the ethic of marriage as against the sanctity of the celibate estate,
the ethical activity of wealth and acquisition against the sanctity of poverty and
its idleness, the ethic of obedience dedicated to the right of the state as against
the sanctity of undutiful and lawless obedience, of the servitude of conscience.
With the need for right and ethical life and insight into the free nature of mind,
the dispute sets in between them and the religion of unfreedom. It would be no
use for the laws and the political order to be transformed into a rational organ­
ization of right, if in religion the principle of unfreedom is not given up. The
two are incompatible with each other; it is a foolish idea to want to assign separ­
ate spheres to them, under the impression that their diversity will keep the peace
between them and not flare up into contradiction and conflict. Principles oflaw­
ful freedom can only be abstract and superficial, and political institutions derived
from them must be for themselves untenable, if the wisdom of those principles
misunderstands religion so grossly that it is unaware that the principles of the
reason of actuality have their ultimate and supreme verification in the religious
conscience, in subsumption under the consciousness of absolute truth. Suppose
that, no matter how, a legislation had arisen, so to speak a priori, which had
the principles of reason as its foundation, but in contradiction with the nation­
al religion based on principles of spiritual unfreedom. Then the operation of the
legislation lies in the hands of individuals, b�th in the government as such and
at all levels and branches of the administration; it is just an abstract, empty idea,

Objective Mind

254

to delude ourselves with the possibility that the individuals will act only accord­
ing to the sense or lener of the legislation, and not in the spirit of their religion,
where their inmost conscience and supreme obligation lies. In this contrast with
what religion pronounces holy, the laws appear as a human artefact; they could,
even if they were backed by sanctions and externally introduced, offer no lasting
resistance to the contradictions and assaults on them of the religious spirit. Such
laws, even if they have the genuine content, founder on the conscience, whose
spirit is different from the spirit of the laws and does not sanction them. It is
to be considered j ust a folly of modern times to alter a system of corrupt eth­
ical life, its political constitution and legislation without changing the religion,
to have made a revolution without a reformation, to suppose that with the old
religion and its sanctities a political constitution opposed to it
peace and harmony, and that stability

can

can

have internal

be procured for the laws by external

guarantees, e.g. so-called chambers, and the power given them to determine the
budget (c£

§544

Remark) and the like. To want to separate the rights and laws

from religion, when we are powerless to descend into the depths of the religious
spirit and to elevate that very spirit to its truth, is to be regarded as no more than
a stopgap. Those guarantees are but ronen suppons against the

conscience of the

subjects who are supposed to apply the laws- and that includes the guarantees
themselves; in fact it is the most profane, the supreme contradiction to want to
bind and subject the religious conscience to a worldly legislation that it regards as

a profanity. 1 0

To take a specific case, the recognition had dawned on

Plato of the

gulf that

had opened up in his day between, on the one hand, the established religion
and the political constitution and, on the other hand, the deeper requirements
made on religion and the political order by a freedom that was now becoming
conscious of its inwardness.

Plato conceives the thought that a genuine constitu­

tion and political life have their deeper foundation on the Idea, on the principles,
universal and genuine in and for themselves, of eternal justice. To know and
recognize these principles is certainly the determination and task of philosophy.

Plato sallies forth into the famous or infam­
Socrates declare so very emphatically that philosophy and

It is from this point of view that
ous passage where he has

political power must coincide, that the Idea

must be the sovereign, if the distress

of peoples is to come to an end. Here Plato had the determinate conception that
the Idea, which

in itseljis certainly the free self-determining thought, can come to

consciousness only in the form of thought; as a content that, in order to be true,
must be drawn out into universality and brought to consciousness in its most

abstract form. 1 1

I n order to compare the Platonic standpoint i n complete determinacy with
the point of view from which the state is here considered in relation to reli­
gion, we need to be reminded of the conceptual differences on which everything
essentially depends here. The first consists in the fact that in natural things their
substance, the genus, is different from their existence, in which the substance is

Ethical Life

255

as subject; but in addition this subjective existence of the genus is distinct from
the existence that the genus or in general the universal gets, accentuated as such
for itself, in the representer, the thinker. This further individuality, the habitat
of the free existence of universal substance, is the selfof the thinking mind. The
content of natural things does not acquire the form of universality and essenti­
ality through itself, and their individuality is not itself the form; only subjective
thinking is the form for itself and in philosophy gives that universal content an
existence for itself.12 The human content by contrast is the free mind itself, and
it comes to existence in mind's self-consciousness. This absolute content, the
intrinsically concrete mind, is just this: to have the form itself, thinking, for its
content. 13 Aristotle soared above the Platonic Idea (the genus, the substantial) to
the heights of the thinking consciousness of this determination in his concept of
the entelechy of thinking, which is v6rJOLS Tijs vo�aEws. I 4 But thinking in gener­
al involves, just because of the determination indicated, the immediate being-for­
selfof subjectivity as well as universality, and the genuine Idea of the intrinsically
concrete mind is in the one of its determinations, subjective consciousness, just
as essentially as in the other, universality, and is the same substantial content in
the one as in the other. But the first of these forms involves feeling, intuition,
representation, and it is in fact necessary that consciousness of the absolute Idea
should be conceived in this shape earlier in time, and stand there in its immediate
actuality as religion before it does so as philosophy. 1 5 Philosophy first develops
only from this foundation again, as surely as Greek philosophy is later than Greek
religion and attained its completion by conceiving and comprehending in all its
determinate essentiality the principle of the mind that first manifests itself in reli­
gion. But Greek philosophy could only set itself in opposition to its religion, and
the unity of thought and the substantiality of the Idea could only take up a hos­
tile attitude to the polytheism of fantasy, to the cheerful and frivolous jocularity
of this poetic invention. The form in its infinite truth, the subjectivity of mind,
burst forth at first only as subjective free thinking, which was not yet identical
with substantiality itself, and so substantiality was not yet conceived as absolute
mind. Thus religion could first appear purified only through pure thinking that is
for itself, through philosophy; but the form immanent in the substantial, the form
combatted by philosophy, was that poetic fantasy. 16 The state, which develops
in the same way from religion, but earlier than philosophy, exhibits in actual­
ity the one-sidedness, involved in its implicitly genuine Idea, as corruption. Plato,
recognising, in common with all his thinking contemporaries, this corruption of
democracy and the defectiveness even of its principle, accentuated the substan­
tial, but could not work into his Idea of the state the infinite form of subjectivity,
which was still hidden from his mind; his state is therefore intrinsically without
subjectivefreedom (§503 Remark, §5 1 3, etc.). That is why he conceives the truth,
which should reside in the state, constitute and control it, only in the form of
thought truth, of philosophy; and hence he made that announcement that as long
as philosophers do not rule in states, or those who are now called kings and rulers

256

Objective Mind

do not philosophize thoroughly and comprehensively, until then neither the state
nor the human race will find any liberation from their ailments; until then the
Idea of his political constitution can never become a possibility and see the light
of dayY It was not granted to Plato to advance to the point of saying that as
long as the genuine religion does not arise in the world and become dominant
in states, then the genuine principle of the state has not yet come into actuality.
But until then this principle could not even enter into thought, the genuine Idea
of the state could not be conceived by thought, - the Idea of substantial ethical
life, with which the freedom of the self-consciousness that is for itself is identical.
Only in the principle of the mind that is aware of its essence, is in itselfabsolutely
free, and has its actuality in the activity of its liberation, is the absolute possibility
and necessity to be found for state power, religion, and the principles of philo­
sophy to coincide, for the reconciliation of actuality in general with the mind, of
the state with the religious conscience as well as with philosophical knowledge,
to be accomplished. Since subjectivity that is for itself is absolutely identical with
substantial universality, both religion as such and the state as such, as forms in
which the principle exists, contain in them the absolute truth, so that this truth,
when it appears as philosophy, is itself only in one of its forms. 1 8 But since reli­
gion too, in the development of itself, develops the distinctions contained in
the Idea (§§566 ff.), the reality can , in fact must, appear in its first immediate,
i.e. itself one-sided manner, and religion's existence become corrupted to sens­
ory externality, and so proceed to the suppression of the freedom of spirit and
to perversity of political life. But the principle contains the infinite elasticity of
the absolute form, so as to overcome this corruption of the deterrriinations of its
form, and the consequent degeneration of the content, and to bring about the
reconciliation of the spirit within itself. So at last, in the Protestant conscience
the principle of the religious conscience and of the ethical conscience becomes
one and the same, -the free mind aware of itself in its rationality and truth.
The constitution and legislation, as well as their operation, have as their content
the principle and the development of ethical life, which proceeds, and can only
proceed, from the truth of religion, when this truth is established as the origin­
al principle of ethical life and thereby first becomes actual as such. The ethical
life of the state and the religious spirituality of the state are thus firm reciprocal
guarantees. l 9

SECTION I l l
AB S O LUTE M I N D
§553
The concept of mind has its reality in the mind. That this reality be knowledge
of the absolute Idea and thus in identity with the concept, involves the neces­
sary aspect that the implicitly free intelligence be in its actuality liberated to its
concept, in order to be the shape worthy of the concept. The subjective and the
objective mind are to be regarded as the way on which this aspect of reality or
existence develops itself. I

§554
The absolute mind is identity, both an identity that is eternally within itself and
an identity that returns and has returned into itself: the one and universal sub­
stance as spiritual, the judgement discerning itself into itselfand an awareness, an
awareness for which the substance is as such.1 Religion, as this supreme sphere can
in general be designated, is to be regarded as issuing from the subject and situ­
ated in the subject, but is equally to be regarded as objectively issuing from the
absolute spirit, which as spirit is in its community.2
[Remark] That here, and in general, belief is not opposite to knowledge, but that
belief is rather a sort of knowledge, belief being only a particular form of know­
ledge, has been observed above in the Remark to §63. If nowadays there is so
little knowledge of God and so little attention is given to his objective essence,
whereas people speak all the more of religion, i.e. of God's indwelling in the sub­
jective sphere, and if religion, not the truth as such, is called for, this at least
involves the correct determination that God must be conceived as spirit in his
community.3

§555
The subjective consciousness of the absolute mind is essentially a process with­
in itself, a process whose immediate and substantial unity is belief through the

258

Absolute Mind

witness of the spirit as certainty of the objective truth. Belief-at once this imme­
diate unity and containing this unity as the relationship of these different determ­
inations-has, in devotion, in the implicit or explicit cult, passed over into the
process of sublating the contrast up to spiritual liberation, the process of verifYing
that initial certainty by this mediation, and of gaining the concrete determination
of this certainty, namely the reconciliation, the actuality of the spirit. 1

A. Art
§556
As immediate (-the moment of the finitude ofart), 1 the shape of this knowledge
is, on the one hand, a disintegration into a work of external common reality,
the subject producing the work, and the intuiting and venerating subject.2 On
the other hand, it is the concrete intuition and representation of the implicitly
absolute mind as the ideal. In this ideal- the concrete shape born of subjective
mind-natural immediacy is only a sign of the Idea, it is so transfigured by the
informing mind for the expression of the Idea, that nothing else is shown in the
shape; - the shape of beauty.3

§557
The sensory externality in the beautiful, the fonn of immediacy as such, is at the
same time a detenninacy ofcontent, and along with his spiritual determination the
god also has within him at the same time the determination of a natural element
or reality. - He contains the so-called unity of nature and spirit- i.e. the imme­
diate unity, the form of intuition; and so not the spiritual unity, in which the
natural is posited only as something ideal, something sublated, and the spiritual
content stands in relation only to itself; it is not the absolute mind that enters into
this consciousness} On the subjective side the community is of course an ethical
community, since it is aware of its essence as spiritual and its self-consciousness
and actuality are herein elevated to substantial freedom. But encumbered with
immediacy, the freedom of the subject is only custom, without infinite reflection
into itself, without the subjective inwardness of conscience; in its further develop­
ment too the devotion and the cult of the religion of beautiful art is determined
accordingly.2

§558
Art not only needs, for the intuitions to be produced by it, an external given

material, which includes subjective images and representations. It also needs,
for the expression of spiritual content, the given forms of nature together with
their meaning, which art must discern and appropriate (c£ §4 1 1 ) . Among such

260

Absolute Mind

formations the human is the supreme and genuine formation, because only in it
can the spirit have its bodiliness and thus an expression accessible to intuition. 1
[Remark] This takes care of the principle of the imitation ofnature in art, about
which no agreement is possible when the contrast is so abstract, as long as the
natural is taken only in its externality, not as a characteristic, meaningful natural
form signifYing the spirit. 2

§559
In such individuality of shaping the absolute mind cannot be explicated; the spir­
it of beautiful art is therefore the limited spirit of a people, a spirit whose implicit
universality, when advance is made to the further determination of its riches, dis­
integrates into an indeterminate polytheism. 1 With the essential restrictedness
of its content, beauty in general becomes no more than the penetration of the
intuition or the image by the spiritual,-becomes something formal, so that the
representation or the content of the thought can, just like the material which the
content uses for its embodiment, be of the most diverse and even inessential kind,
and yet the work can still be something beautiful and a work of art. 2

§560
The one-sidedness of immediacy in the ideal involves the opposite one-sidedness
(§556) : it is something made by the artist. 1 The subject is theformality of activity
and the work ofart is an expression of the god only when there is no sign of sub­
jective particularity in it, and the content of the indwelling spirit has conceived
and brought itself forth into the world, without admixture and unsullied by its
contingency. Bur as freedom only advances as far as thinking, the activity filled
with this indwelling content, the impiration of the artist, is, as an unfree passion,
like an alien power within the artist; the producing has in it the form of natural
immediacy, it belongs to the genius as this particular subject-and is at the same
time a labour occupied with technical intelligence and mechanical externalities.
The work of art therefore is just as much a work of free wilfulness, and the artist is
the master of the god.2

§561
In this inspiration, reconciliation appears as the beginning in such a way that it
is immediately accomplished in the subjective self-consciousness, which is thus
secure and cheerful within itself, without the depth and without consciousness
of its contrast to the essence that is in and for itself.! Beyond the completion
of beauty in classical art attained in such reconciliation lies the art of sublimity,
symbolic art, in which the figuration suitable to the Idea is not yet found; the
thought, going forth and struggling with the shape, is displayed as a negative

Art

26 1

attitude towards it, while at the same time it endeavours to embody itself in the
shape. The meaning, the content, thereby shows that it has not yet reached the
infinite form, that it is not yet known as free spirit and not yet conscious of itself
as free spirit. The content is only the abstract god of pure thinking or a striving
towards him, a striving without rest or reconciliation which throws itself into
shape after shape, since it cannot find its goal. 2

§562
But the other mode of incongruity between the Idea and the figuration is this:
the infinite torm, subjectivity, is not, as in that first extreme, only superficial per­
sonality, but the inmost depth, and the god is known not as merely seeking its
shape or satisfYing himself in an external shape, but as finding himself only within
himself, thus assuming his adequate shape in the spiritual alone. So art, romantic
an, gives up the task of showing God as such in external shape and by means
of beauty; it displays him as only condescending to appearance, and presents
the divine as inwardness in the externality from which it disengages itself. This
externality can therefore here appear in a contingent relation to its meaning. 1
[Remark] The philosophy of religion has to discern the logical necessity in the
progression of the determinations of the essence known as the absolute. It has
to ascertain the determinations to which a particular kind of worship primar­
ily corresponds. It has to discover how worldly self-consciousness, consciousness
of what is the supreme determination of man, and hence how the nature of
a people's ethical life, the principle of its law, of its actual freedom and of its
constitution, as well as of its an and science, correspond to the principle that con­
stitutes the substance of a religion. That all these moments of a people's actuality
make up one systematic totality and that one spirit creates and informs them, this
insight lies at the basis of the further insight that the histoty of religions coincides
with world-histoty.2
"VQe need to make a more specific remark about the close connection of an with
religio ns: beautifol art can belong only to those religions in which the principle is
the concrete spirituality that has become free within itself, but is not yet absolute.3
In religions in which the Idea has not yet been revealed and is not yet known in its
free determinacy, the need of an does of course make itself felt, in order to bring
the representation of the essence to consciousness in intuition and fantasy, in fact
art is even the only organ in which the abstract, intrinsically unclear content, a
mishmash of natural and spiritual elements, can strive to bring itself to conscious­
ness. But this art is defective; because it has such a defective content, the form is
defective too; for the content is defective owing to that fact that it does not have
the form immanent in it. The ponrayal retains a side of tastelessness and spirit­
lessness, since the vety interior is still encumbered with spiritlessness, hence has
not the power freely to imbue the external with meaning and shape. Beautifol an,
by contrast, has for its condition the self-consciousness of the free spirit, hence

262

Absolute Mind

the consciousness that the sensory and merely natural lacks independence in the
face of spirit, and so makes the sensory and natural into nothing more than the
expression of spirit; it is the inner form that expresses itself alone. 4
Connected with this is a further, higher consideration: the advent of art
announces the demise of a religion still bound to sensory externality. At the
same time, since it seems to give religion the supreme transfiguration, expression,
and splendour, it has elevated religion beyond its limitation. In the sublime
divinity whose expression is achieved by the work of art, the artist's genius
and the spectator are at home, with their own sense and sensation, satisfied
and liberated; the intuition and consciousness of the free spirit are granted and
attained. Beautiful art, on its side, has performed the same service as philosophy:
purification of the spirit from unfreedom.5 The religion in which the need of
beautiful art first engenders itself, and engenders itself for that very reason, has in
its principle a thoughtless and sensory beyond; the images devoutly worshiped
are the unbeautiful idols, as wonder-working talismans, which point to an
unspiritual otherworldly objectivity, and bones perform the same or even better
service than such images.6 But beautiful art is only a stage of liberation, not
the supreme liberation itself. -Genuine objectivity, which resides only in the
element of thought, the element in which alone the pure spirit is for the spirit,
in which liberation is accompanied with reverence, is also lacking in the sensory
beauty of the work of art, still more in that external, unbeautiful sensoriness. 7

§563
Beautiful art (like the religion peculiar to it) has its future in genuine religion.
The restricted content of the Idea passes over in and for itself into the univer­
sality identical with the infinite form, -intuition, immediate knowledge bound
to sensoriness, passes over into self-mediating knowledge, into a reality which is
itself knowledge, into revelation; so that the content of the Idea has as its principle
the determination of the free intelligence, and, as absolute spirit, isfor the spirit. 1

B . Revealed Religion
§564
It lies essentially in the concept of genuine religion, i.e. the religion whose con­
tent is absolute mind, that it is revealed, and in fact revealed by God. For since
knowledge, the principle by which the substance is mind, is, as the infinite form
that is for itself, self-determining knowledge, it is manifestation pure and simple;
the spirit is only spirit in so far as it is for the spirit, and in the absolute religion
it is the absolute spirit that no longer manifests abstract moments of itself, but its
very self. 1
[Remark] T o the ancient idea of nemesis, according t o which the divine and
its operation in the world was conceived by the still abstract intellect only as an
equalizing power, shattering the high and mighty, Plato and Aristotle retorted that
God is not grudging. 2 The same retort can be made to recent assertions that man
cannot get to know God; these assertions (for these claims are no more than asser­
tions) are all the more inconsistent, when they are made within a religion that
is expressly called the revealed religion, so that according to these assertions it
would rather be the religion in which nothing was revealed of God, in which he
had not revealed himself, and these adherents of it would be 'the heathen' 'who
know nothing of God'. If the word God is taken seriously in religion at all, then
the determination too may and must start from him, the content and principle
of religion, and if self-revelation is denied to him, then all that would remain of a
co�ent of God would be to ascribe envy to him. But if the word mind is to have a
se �s�at all, then mind involves the revelation ofirself.3
If- we consider the difficulty of systematic knowledge of God as spirit, know­
ledge that cannot acquiesce in the simple representations of faith but proceeds
to thinking, initially to the reflective intellect, but is supposed to proceed to
conceptual thinking, it is hardly surprising that so many people, particularly
theologians, who are specifically called upon to concern themselves with these
Ideas, have lapsed into getting off more lightly with them and have willingly
accepted what was offered them for this purpose; the easiest thing of all is the
result indicated: that man knows nothing of God. To apprehend correctly and
determinately in thought what God as spirit is, requires thorough speculation. 4
For a start, the following propositions are involved in it: God is God only in so
far as he knows his own self; his self-knowledge is, moreover, a self-consciousness
in man and man's knowledge ofGod, which proceeds to man's self-knowledge in

264

Absolute Mind

God. S - See the thorough elucidation of these propositions in the work from
which they are taken: Aphorisms on Knowing and Not-knowing, etc, by C. F.

§565
The absolute spirit in the sublated immediacy and sensoriness of shape and of
knowledge is, in content, the spirit that is in and for itself, the spirit of nature and
of mind; in form it is initially for the subjective knowledge of representation. 1 On
the one hand, representation gives independence to the moments of its content
and makes them into presuppositions with respect to each other and into appear­
ances following each other and into happeningr interconnected according to finite
determinations of rejlexion;2 on the other hand, the form of this finite mode of
representation is also sublated in the faith in the one spirit and in the devotion of
worship.3

§566
In this separation, the form diverges from the content and in the form the dif­
ferent moments of the concept diverge into particular spheres or elements, in
each of which the absolute content displays itself, (a) as eternal content, remain­
ing together with itself in its manifestation; (�) as differentiation of the eternal
essence from its manifestation, which through this difference becomes the world
of appearance into which the content enters; (y) as infinite return and recon­
ciliation of the alienated world with the eternal essence, the withdrawal of the
essence from appearance into the unity of its fullness.1

§567
(a) In the moment of universality, of the sphere of pure thought or the abstract
element of the essence, it is therefore the absolute spirit that is first of all the
presupposition, not, however, self-enclosed and static. As substantial power in the
reflexion-determination of causality, it is creator of heaven and eanh; but in this
eternal sphere it generates only its own selfas its son; it remains in original identity
with what is thus differentiated from itself, but equally this determination-of
being what is differentiated from the universal essence-eternally sublates itself,
and, through this mediation of self-sublating mediation, the first substance essen­
tially becomes concrete individuality and subjectivity, - is spirit. 1

§568
(�) But in the moment of the particularity of the judgement, 1 this concrete etern­
al essence is what is presupposed, and its movement is the creation of appearance, 2
the disintegration of the eternal moment of mediation, of the unitary son, into

Revealed Religion

265

independent opposites, on the one hand heaven and eanh , elemental and con­
crete nature, and, on the other hand, spirit as standing in relationship with nature,
hence finite spirit.3 Spirit, as the extreme of the negativity that is within itself,
asserts its independence to the point of evil; it is such an extreme through its rela­
tion to a nature confronting it and through its own naturalness which is thereby
posited; in this naturalness it is, as thinking, also directed towards the eternal, but
it stands in an external relation with it.4

§569
(y) In the moment of individuality as such, viz. of subjectivity and the concept
itself, as the opposition of universality and particularity that has returned into
its identicaL ground,1 ( 1 ) the universal substance presents itself as presupposition,
actualized out of its abstraction to individual self-consciousness; it presents this
self-consciousness as immediately identical with the essence, as that son of the
eternal sphere transposed into temporality; and in him it presents evil as implicitly
sublated. But further, this immediate and thus sensory existence of the absolutely
concrete, putting itself in judgement and expiring into the pain of negativity, in
which it, as infinite subjectivity, is identical with itself, has become for itself as
absolute return from negativity and as universal unity of universal and individual
essentiality, - the Idea of the eternal, but living spirit, present in the world.2

§570
(2) This objective totality is the presupposition, a presupposition that is in itself,
for the finite immediacy of the individual subject. For the subject therefore it
is initially something other and intuited, but the intuition of the truth that is
in itselp Through this witness of the spirit in him, the subject, owing to his
immediate nature, initially determines himself as what is nugatory and evil, and
further, according to the example of its truth, by means of faith in the unity,
accOn:�plished implicitly in that example, of universal and individual essentiality,
he is �o the movement of shedding his immediate natural determinacy and his
own will, and of joining together with that example and its ln-itselfin the pain of
negativity, and so of recognizing himself as united with the essence. 2 (3) Through
this mediation the essence brings about its own indwelling in self-consciousness,
and is the actual presence of the spirit that is in and for itself as the universal
spirit.3

§571
These three syllogisms, which constitute the one syllogism of the absolute medi­
ation of spirit with itself, are the revelation of spirit, a revelation that explicates
the life of spirit in the cycle of concrete shapes of representation. l In its result,
the joining of spirit together with itself, the unfolding of the mediation pulls itself

266

Absolute Mind

together out of its dispersal and out of its temporal and external succession, not
only to the simplicity of faith and devotional feeling, but also to thinking. In the
immanent simplicity of thinking the unfolding likewise has its expansion, but
known as an inseparable connection of the universal, simple and eternal spirit
within itself. In this form of truth, truth is the object ofphilosophy. 2
[Remark] If the result, the spirit that is for itself, in which all mediation has sub­
lated itself, is taken only in afonnal, contentless sense, so that the spirit is not at
the same time known as being in itselfand objectively unfolding itself, then that
infinite subjectivity is the merely formal self-consciousness that knows itselfwith­
in itself as absolute- irony. Irony, which knows how to reduce every objective
content to nothing, to a vanity, is therefore itself the emptiness and vanity that for
its determination derives its content from itself, a content that is thus contingent
and arbitrary, it remains master over the content, is not bound by it, and, with
the assurance that it stands at the very summit of religion and philosophy, it falls
back rather into hollow wilfulness. Only when the pure infinite form, the self­
manifestation that is together with itself, sheds the one-sidedness of subjectivity
in which it is the vanity of thinking, is it the free thinking which also has its infin­
ite determination as absolute content that is in and for itself, and has that content
as an object in which it is likewise free. In this respect, thinking is itself only the
formal aspect of the absolute content.3

C. Philosophy
§572
This science is the unity of art and religion, in so far as art's mode of intuition,
external in form, its subjective production and splintering of the substantial con­
tent into many independent shapes, is not only held together into a whole in
religion's totality, in religion's expansion unfolding itself in representation and
its mediation of what is thus unfolded. It is also unified into the simple spiritual
intuition and then elevated in it to self-conscious thinking. This knowledge is thus
the thinkingly cognized concept of art and religion, in which the diversity in the
content is cognized as necessary, and this necessity is cognized as free. 1

§573
Philosophy accordingly determines itself into a cognition of the necessity of the
content of the absolute representation, as well as of the necessity of the two forms:
on the one hand, immediate intuition and its poetry and the presupposing represent­
ation, the objective and external revelation; on the other hand, first the subjective
withdrawal into self, then the subjective movement outwards and the identific­
ation offaith with the presupposition.1 This cognition is thus the recognition of
this content and its form, and liberation from the one-sidedness of the forms and
the elevation of them into the absolute form, which determines itself to the con­
tent and remains identical with the content, and is in this respect the cognition of
that ne�ity that is in and for itself.2 This movement, which philosophy is, finds
itself already accomplished, when at the conclusion it grasps its own concept, i.e.
only looks back on its knowledge. 3
[Remark] This would seem to be the place to deal with the relationship ofphilo­
sophy to religion in a determinate discus.s.ion. The whole question turns entirely
on the difference of the forms of speculative thinking from the forms of repres­
entation and of the reflective intellect. But it is the whole course of philosophy,
and of logic in particular, which has not only made known this difference, but
also assessed it, or rather has let its nature develop and direct itself in these very
categories.4 Only on the basis of this cognition of the forms can the genuine
conviction that was in question be won, that the content of philosophy and of
religion is the same, apart from the additional content of external nature and
of finite mind which does not fall within the scope of religion. But religion is

268

Absolute Mind

the truth for all men, faith rests on the witness of the spirit, the spirit that, as
witnessing, is the spirit in man. This witness, substantial in itself, initially couches
itself, in so far as it is driven to explicate itself, in terms of the general culture of its
worldly consciousness and intellect; in this way the truth lapses into the determ­
inations and relationships of finitude in general. This does not prevent the spirit,
even in the use of sensory representations and the finite categories of thinking,
from holding on to its content, which being religious is essentially speculative, in
the face of these representations and categories, from doing violence to them and
being inconsistent with them. By this inconsistency it corrects their defects; that
is why there is nothing easier for the intellect than to point out contradictions
in the exposition of faith, and so to stage triumphs for its principle, formal iden­
tity. If the spirit gives way to this finite reflection, which has called itself reason
and philosophy (- rationalism), then it reduces the religious content to finitude,
reduces it in fact to nothing. Religion in that case has a perfect right to protest
against such reason and philosophy and to open hostilities with them.s But it
is a different matter if religion sets itself against conceptual reason, and against
philosophy in general, and specifically also against a philosophy whose content is
speculative and thus religious. Such opposition rests on deficiency of insight into
the nature of the difference indicated and of the value of spiritual forms in gen­
eral, and particularly of the thought-forms, and, most specifically of all, it rests
on deficiency of insight into the difference between these forms and the content,
which can be the same in both forms. Philosophy has endured reproaches and
accusations, on the basis of its form from the side of religion, and, conversely,
because of its speculative content from a self-styled philosophy, and likewise from
a contemless piety; it had too Little of God in it for the former, too much for
the latter.
The charge of atheism, which used often to be brought against philoso­
phy, -that it has too little of God, has become rare; but the charge of pantheism,
that it has too much of him, has become all the more widespread; so much so,
that it is treated not so much as an accusation, but as a proven fact, or even as
a fact in need of no proof, a sheer fact. Piety in particular, which in any case
in its pious superiority believes itself exempt from giving proofs, commits itself,
in unison with the empty philosophy of the intellect (to which it claims to be
so opposed, though in fact it rests entirely on this culture), to the assurance, as
if it were just the mention of a familiar matter, that philosophy is the all-one
doctrine or pantheism.6 It must be said that it did more credit to piety and
theology to accuse a philosophical system (e.g. Spinozism) of atheism than of
pantheism, although at first sight the former accusation looks harsher and more
invidious (cf. §71 Remark) . After all, the accusation of atheism presupposes a
determinate representation of a contentfitl God, and then arises from the fact
that representation does not recognize in the philosophical concepts the peculiar
forms to which it is committed.? That is to say, philosophy can indeed recognize
its own forms in the categories of the religious mode of representation, and thus

Philosophy

269

also its own content in religious content, and do justice to religious content;
but the converse does not hold, since the religious mode of representation does
not apply the critique of thought to itself and does not comprehend itself, and
is therefore exclusive in its immediacy. s The charge of pantheism instead of
atheism against philosophy belongs especially to modern culture, to the new
piety and new theology, which finds in philosophy too much God, so much
so, that God, according to the assurance of the new theology, is supposed to
be in fact everyrhing and everyrhing to be God. For this new theology, which
makes religion only a subjective feeling and denies the knowledge of God's
nature, thereby retains nothing more than a God in general without objective
determinations. Without any interest of its own in the concrete, fulfilled concept
of God, it regards such a concept only as an interest which others once had,
and hence treats what belongs to the doctrine of God's concrete nature merely
as something historical. The indeterminate God is to be found in all religions;
every kind of piety (§72) -Indian piety towards monkeys, cows, etc. or towards
the Dalai Lama, Egyptian piety towards the ox, etc. - is always veneration of an
object which, along with its absurd determinations, also involves the abstraction
of the genus, of God in general. If such a God is sufficient for this view to find
God in everyrhing that is called religion, then it must find at least such a God
recognized in philosophy too, and can no longer very well accuse it of atheism.
The mitigation of the reproach of atheism into that of pantheism has its ground
therefore only in the superficiality of the representation to which this leniency
has managed to attenuate and evacuate God.9 As this representation sticks to
its abstract universality, from which all determinacy is excluded, the determinacy
is, in addition, only the profane, the worldly existence of things, which thereby
persists in fixed, undisturbed substantiality. With such a presupposition, despite
the universality that is in and for itself, which is affirmed of God in philosophy
and in which the being of external things has no truth, they persist as before
in maintaining that worldly things nevertheless retain their being and that it is
worlillNhings that constitute what is determinate in the divine universality. So
they m � this universality into what they call pantheistic universality, -that
everything (i.e. empirical things without distinction, the commonplace as well
as those more highly regarded) is, possesses substantiality, and this being of
worldly things is God. -It is only their own thoughtlessness, and a falsification
of concepts stemming from it, that generates the representation and assurance of
pantheism. 10
But if those who depict any philosophy as pantheism are not able and willing
to see this-for it is precisely the insight into concepts that they repudiate-they
should above all have confirmed j ust as afact, that somephilosopher or some human
being has indeed ascribed reality that is in and for itself, substantiality, to all
things and regarded them as God, that such an idea has entered the head of some
human being besides themselves alone. I propose to shed more light on this fact
in this exoteric discussion; and this can only happen if the facts themselves are

270

Absolute Mind

placed before our eyes. 1 1 If we want to take so-called pantheism in its poetical,
most sublime or, if you prefer, most crass shape, we must, as we all know, look
for this in oriental writers, and the most extensive presentations are to be found
in Indian literature. Among the riches open to us on this matter, I select from the
most authentic account available to us, the Bhagavad Gita, and from among its
tirades, dilated and repeated ad nauseam, a few of the most striking passages. In
the l Oth Lesson (in Schlegel, p. 1 62)12 Krishna says of himself:
I am the breath, indwelling in the body of living things; I am the beginning,
the middle ofliving things, and likewise their end. -1 am the radiant sun among
the stars, I am the moon among the lunar signs. I am the book of hymns among
the holy books, sense among the senses, the intellect of living things, etc. I am
Siva among the Rudras, Meru among the mountain peaks, Himalaya among the
mountains, etc., among beasts I am the lion, etc., among letters I am A, I am the
spring among the seasons, etc. I am the seed of all things, there is nothing that is
without me, etc.
Even in these entirely sensory portrayals, Krishna (and we must not suppose
that there is here, apart from Krishna, God, or a god, besides; he said just now,
that he is Siva, also lndra, and later (Lesson 1 1 , Couplet 1 5) it is said of him
that Brahma too is in him) claims to be, not everything, but only supreme among
everything; everywhere there is a distinction drawn between external, unessen­
tial existences and an essential existence among them, which he is. Even if, at the
beginning of the passage, he is said to be the beginning, middle, and end ofliving
things, this totality is distinguished from the living things themselves as individu­
al existences. Thus even a portrayal which extends divinity so far in its existence
cannot yet be called pantheism; we should rather say only that the infinitely man­
ifold empirical world, the Everything, is reduced to a limited number of essential
existences, to a polytheism. But the quoted passages already imply that even these
substantialities of the externally existent do not retain the independence required
to be called gods; even Siva, Indra, etc. dissolve in the one Krishna. B
A more explicit advance towards this reduction occurs in the following por­
trayal (Lesson 7, Couplets 7 ff.); Krishna speaks: I am the origin of the whole
world and its dissolution. There is nothing superior to me. The universe hangs
on me, like rows of pearls on a string. I am the taste in the waters, the lustre in
sun and moon, the mystic name in all holy books, etc., the life in every living
thing, etc., the intellect of the intelligent, the power of the strong, etc. Then he
adds that through Maya (Schlegel: Magia), which is nothing independent either,
but only his own Maya, through the peculiar qualities, the world is deceived and
so does not know him, the higher one, the unchangeable one, and this Maya is
hard to break through; but those who have a share in him have overcome Maya,
etc.14-Then the representation is condensed in a simple expression; at the end
of many rebirths, says Krishna, the man endowed with science advances to me:
Vasudeva (i.e. Krishna) is the All; the great-souled one, the one who has this con­
viction, is hard to find. Others turn to other gods; I reward them according to

Philosophy

27 1

their faith, but the reward o f those of little insight is limited. Fools regard me as
visible, - me, the invisible, imperishable one, etc. 1 5
This All, which Krishna declares himself t o be, is not the Everything, any more
than the Eleatic one or Spinoza's substance is the Everything. This Everything,
the infinitely various sensory variety of the finite, is in all these representations
determined as the accidental, which is not in and for itself, but has its truth in
the substance, the one, which is different from the accidental and is alone the
divine and God. 16 In any case, the Indian religion progresses to the representa­
tion of Brahma, the pure unity of thought within itself, in which the empirical
Everything of the world, as also those proximate substantialities that are called
gods, disappear. That is why Colebroke and many others have determined the
Indian religion in its essentials as monotheism. That this determination is not
incorrect emerges from our brief quotations.17 But this unity of God, and in fact
of a spiritual God, is so far from concrete within itself, so powerless as it were, that
the Indian religion is the monstrous confusion of being just as much the wildest
polytheism. But the idolatry of the wretched Indian, when he worships the ape, or
whatever else, is still not that wretched idea of a pantheism, for which everything is
God, and God is everything. Indian monotheism, by the way, is itself an example
of how little is gained by mere monotheism, if the Idea of God is not deeply
determined within itself. For that unity, in so far as it is abstract within itself and
therefore empty, itself has the effect of letting the concrete, whether as a number
of gods or of empirical, worldly individualities, remain independent outside it. 1 8
I n fact, according to the shallow representation o f it, even that pantheism could
consistently be called a monotheism as well; for if, according to this representa­
tion, God is identical with the world, then as there is only one world there would
be in this pantheism only one God too. Perhaps empty numerical unity must be
predicated of the world, but this abstract determination has no further particular
interest; on the contrary, this numerical unity is just this: that in its content it is
the infinite multiplicity and variety of finitudes. But it is only this illusion about
empty unity, which makes possible and gives rise to the misconception of a pan­
theism. It is only the repres� n, floating in the indeterminate void, of the
world as one thing, the All, that was ever able to be considered combinable with
God; only that made it possible for people to think that we had meant that God
is the world; for if the world had been taken as it is, as everything, as the endless
mass of empirical existences, then it would hardly have been even held possible
for there to have been a pantheism that asserted of such content that it is God. 1 9
But to return once more to the facts o f the case. I f we want t o see the con­
sciousness of the one, not split, in the Indian way, into the determinationless
unity of abstract thinking, on the one hand, and on the other, the tiresome; even
litany-like, implementation in the particular, but in the finest purity and sublim­
ity, we must consult the Mohammedans.When, e.g., in the excellent ]elaleddin­
Rumi in particular, we find displayed the unity of the soul with the One, and this
unity displayed as love, then this spiritual unity is an elevation above the finite

272

Absolute Mind

and the commonplace, a transfiguration of the natural and the spiritual, in which
precisely the externality, the transience of immediate nature, and of empirical
worldly spirit, is discarded and absorbed. 20*
' In the interests of a more precise idea, I cannot refrain from quoting a few passages here, which
may at the same time give some idea of the marvellous art of Ruckeri s rendering, from which they
are taken:
III. I saw but One through all heaven's starry spaces gleaming:
I saw but One in all sea billows wildly streaming.
I looked into the heart, a waste of worlds, a sea, I saw a thousand dreams, -yet One amid all dreaming.
And earth, air, water, fire, when thy decree is given,
Are molten into One: against thee none hath striven.
There is no living heart but bears unfailingly
In the one song of praise to thee, from earth and heaven.

V. As one ray of thy light appears the noonday sun,
But yet thy light and mine eternally are one.

As dust beneath thy feet the heaven that rolls on high:

Yet only one, and one for ever, thou and I.
The dust may rum to heaven, and heaven to dust decay;
Yet art thou one with me, and shalt be one for ave.
How may the words of life that fill heaven's uUU:ost part
Rest in the narrow casket of one poor human heart?
How can the sun's own rays, a fairer gleam to fling,
Hide in a lowly husk, the jewel's covering'
How may the rose-grove all its glorious bloom unfold,
Drinking in mire and slime, and feeding on the mould?
How can the darksome shell that sips the salt sea stream
Fashion a shining pearl, the sunlight's joyous beam?
Oh, heart! should warm winds fan thee, should'st thou floods endure,
One element are wind and flood; but be thou pure.

IX. I'll tell thee how from out the dust God moulded man,­

Because the breath of Love He breathed into his dav:
I'll tell thee why the spheres their whirling paths began,­
They mirror to God's throne Love's glory day by day:
I'll tell thee why the morning winds blow o'er the grove,­
It is to bid Love's roses bloom abundanth�
I'll tell thee why the night broods deep the earth above,­
Love's bridal tent to deck with sacred canopy:
All riddles of the earth dost thou desire to prove?­
To every earthly riddle is Love alone the key.

XV. Life shrinks from Death in woe and fear,

Though Death ends well Life's bitter need.
So shrinks the heart when Love draws near,
As though 'rwere Death in very deed:
For wheresoever Love finds room,
There Self, the sullen tyrant, dies.
So let him perish in the gloom, Thou to the dawn of freedom rise.21

In this poetry, which soars above the external and sensory, who will recognize the prosaic idea which
is formed of so-called pantheism and which rather transposes the divine down into the external and
the sensory? The copious reportS which Tholuck gives us of the poems ofJelaleddin and others in his

Philosophy

27 3

I refrain from multiplying examples of the religious and poetic representations
which it is customary to call pantheistic. Of the philosophies to which that name
has been given, e.g. the Eleatic, or Spinozist, it has already been remarked earli­
er (§50, Remark) that so far are they from identifYing God with the world and
making him finite, that in these philosophies this Everything has no truth, and
that we should more correctly designate them as monotheisms and, in relation to
the representation of the world, as acosmisms. They would be most accurately
determined as the systems that conceive the absolute only as substance. Of the ori­
ental, especially the Mohammedan, modes of representation, we may rather say
that the absolute appears as the utterly universal genus which resides in the species,
in the existences, but in such a way that no actual reality accrues to them. The
fault of all these modes of representation and systems is that they do not proceed
to the determination of substance as subject and as mind. 23
These systems and modes of representation stan from the one need common
to all philosophies, as well as all religions, the need to conceive a representation
of God and then of the relationship of God and the world. In philosophy it is
more precisely recognised that God's relationship to the world is determined by
the determination of God's nature. The reflective intellect begins by rejecting all
systems and modes of representation, which, whether they spring from the hean,
fantasy or speculation, express the interconnection of God and the world; and in
order to have God purely in faith or consciousness, he is separated as the essence
from the appearance, as the infinite from the finite. But after this separation the
conviction also arises of the relation of the appearance to the essence, of the finite
to the infinite, and so on, and with it the now reflective question as to the nature
of this relation. It is in the form of the reflection about this relation that the whole
difficulty of the matter lies. It is this relation that is called the incomprehensible
by those who insist on knowing nothing of God's nature.24 The close of philo­
sophy is no longer the place, and not at all in an exoteric discussion, to waste a
word on the question of what comprehending means. But as the view taken of this
relation is closely connected with the view taken of science generally and with
all the accusations against it, we may add this remark about it: since philosophy
certainly has to do with unity in general, though not with abstract unity, mere
work, Anthology of Oriental Mysticism, are made /Tom the very point of view here under discussion.
In the Introduction,Tholuck proves how profoundly his hean has comprehended mysticism; there,
too, he determines in more detail the character of oriental mysticism, and the contrasting character
of western and Christian mysticism. Despite their difference, they share the determination of being
mysticism. The combination of mysticism with so-called pantheism, he says (p. 33), involves the
inner vitality of hean and mind which essentially consists in this: annihilation of that external
Everything that is usually ascribed to pantheism. Otherwise Tholuck leaves matters standing at the
usual unclear representation of pantheism; a more thorough discussion of this representation was
initially of no interest for the author's emotional standpoint; but we see that he himself is gripped
by remarkable enthusiasm for a mysticism which, according to the usual expression, is to be called
entirely pantheistic. Where, however, he engages in philosophizing (p. 12), he does not get beyond
the usual standpoint of the metaphysic of the intellect and its uncritical categories. 22

274

Absolute Mind

identity and the empty absolute, but with concrete unity (the concept), and in
its whole course it has to do entirely with this alone; each stage of the advance
is a peculiar determination of this concrete unity, and the deepest and last of the
determinations of unity is the determination of absolute mind. Now those who
want to pass j udgement on philosophy and hold forth about it might be expected
to involve themselves with these determinations of unity and to take the trouble
to get acquainted with them, at least to know this much, that of these determin­
ations there is a great number, and that among them there is a great variety. But
they show so little acquaintance with them, and still less any effort over them,
that as soon as they hear of unity-and relation instantly involves unity-they
stop short at wholly abstract, indeterminate unity, and abstract from the only
thing of any interest, namely the unity's mode of determinacy. Hence they do not
know how to say anything about philosophy except that dry identity is its prin­
ciple and result, and that it is the system of identity. Clinging to this conceptless
thought of identity, they really have not the faintest conception of concrete unity,
the concept and the content of philosophy, but only of its opposite. 25 They pro­
ceed in the field of philosophy, as physicists do in the field of physics. Physicists
too are well aware that they have before them a variety of sensory properties and
stuffs-or usually stuffs only (for properties get transformed into stuffs too for
the physicist) - and that these stuffs also stand in relation to one another. Now
the question is: What type of relation is it? and the peculiarity and the entire dif­
ference of all natural things, inorganic and living, depends solely on the different
determinacy ofthis unity. But instead of getting to know this unity in its different
determinacies, ordinary physics (including chemistry too) conceives only one sort
of unity, the most external, worst unity, viz. composition, applies only this unity in
the whole range of natural structures and so incapacitates itself from understand­
ing any of them. 26
That insipid pantheism results just as immediately from this insipid identity;
those who employ this brain-child of their own to accuse philosophy, learn from
the consideration of God's relation to the world that one, but really only one
moment, of this category, relation, and in fact the moment of indeterminacy, is
identity; their conception now stops halfway, and they assert what is in fact false,
that philosophy maintains the identity of God and the world, and since for them
each of the two, the world as much as God, has solid substantiality, they work
out that in the philosophical Idea God is composed of God and the world; and this
is then the representation which they form of pantheism and which they ascribe
to philosophy.27 Those who in their thinking and apprehension of thoughts do
not get beyond such categories, and with these categories, which they import into
philosophy wherever nothing of the kind is to be found, give philosophy an itch
so that they can scratch it, instantly and very easily avoid any difficulties that
emerge in their conception of God's relation to the world, by confessing that this
relation contains for them a contradiction which they do not understand at all;
hence, they have to leave it at the wholly indeterminate representation of such a

Philosophy

275

relation and likewise of the specific modes of it, e.g. omnipresence, providence,
etc. In this sense faith means no more than a refusal to advance to a determin­
ate representation, to get more involved in the content. That men and classes of
uncultivated intellect are satisfied with indeterminate representations is appropri­
ate; but when a cultivated intellect and an interest in reflective study is willing
to put up with indeterminate representations in what is acknowledged to be a
higher and the highest interest, then it is hard to tell whether the mind really
takes the content seriously. 28 But if those who cling to the aforesaid bare intel­
lect took seriously e.g. the assertion of God's omnipresence, in the sense that they
pictured the faith in it to themselves in determinate representation, in what dif­
ficulty would they be entangled by the faith they have in the genuine reality of
sensory things? They surely would not want, like Epicurus, to let God dwell in
the interspaces of things, i.e. in the pores of the physicists, the pores being the neg­
ative, which is supposed to be alongside the material reality. Even in this alongside
they would have their pantheism of spatiality, - their Everything, determined as
the asunderness of space. But since they would ascribe to God, in his relation to
the world, an efficacy on and in filled space, on and in the world, they would
have the infinite fragmentation of divine actuality into infinite materiality, they
would have the misconception that they call pantheism or all-one-doctrine, in
fact only as the necessary consequence of their own misconceptions of God and
the world.29 But to saddle philosophy with such a thing as this much-discussed
unity or identity is so great a negligence of justice and truth that it can only
be made comprehensible by the difficulty of getting thoughts and concepts into
one's head, i.e. not abstract unity, but the multifarious modes of its determinacy.
If factual claims are advanced and the facts are thoughts and concepts, then it is
indispensable to understand such things. But even the fulfillment of this require­
ment has been rendered superfluous, by the fact that it long ago became aforegone
conclusion that philosophy is pantheism, a system of identity, an all-one doc­
trine, so that anyone who was unaware of this fact would be treated either as
ignorant of a familiar matter, or as prevaricating for some purpose. On account
of this chorus, I believed that I had to speak my mind at greater length and exo­
terically on the outward and inward untruth of this alleged fact; for initially it
is only possible to speak exoterically about the external view of concepts as mere
facts, by which the concepts themselves are perverted into their opposite. But
the esoteric study of God and identity, as well as of cognition and concepts, is
philosophy itsel£30

§574
This concept of philosophy is the self-thinking Idea, the knowing truth (§236) ,
the logical with the meaning that it is the universality verified in the concrete con­
tent as in its actuality. In this way science has returned to its beginning, and the
logical is its result as the spiritual, such that out of the presupposing judgement, in

276

Absolute Mind

which the concept was only in itselfand the beginning was something immediate,
thus out of the appearance which it had in it there, the logical has risen into its
pure principle and also into its element. 1

§575
It is this appearing which initially grounds the further development. The first
appearance is constituted by the syllogism that has the logical as its ground, its
starting-point, and nature as the middle that joins the mind together with the
logical. The logical becomes nature and nature becomes mind. 1 Nature, which
stands berween the mind and its essence, does not in fact separate them into
extremes of finite abstraction, nor does it separate itself from them into some­
thing independent, that as an other only joins together others; for the syllogism is
determined within the Idea, and nature is essentially determined only as a trans­
it point and negative moment and in itself the Idea; but the mediation of the
concept has the external form of transition, and science has the form of the pro­
gression of necessity, so that only in the one extreme is the freedom of the concept
posited as its joining together with itself.2

§576
In the second syllogism this appearance is sublated in so far as this syllogism is
already the standpoint of the mind itself, which is the mediator of the process,
presupposes nature and joins it together with the logica/. 1 It is the syllogism of
spiritual rejlexion within the Idea; science appears as a subjective cognition, whose
aim is freedom and which is itself the way to produce its freedom. 2

§577
The third syllogism is the Idea of philosophy, which has self-knowing reason,
the absolutely universal, for its middle, a middle that divides into mind and
nature, making mind the presupposition, as the process of the Idea's subjective
activity, and nature the universal extreme, as the process of the Idea that is in
itself, objective. 1 The self-judging of the Idea into the rwo appearances (§§575,
576) determines them as its (self-knowing reason's) manifestations, and in it
a unification takes place: it is the concept, the nature of the subject-matter,
that moves onwards and develops, and this movement is equally the activity of
cognition. The eternal Idea, the Idea that is in and for itself, eternally remains
active, engenders and enjoys itself as absolute mind.2
Aristotle, Metaphysics, XII, 7
Thinking that is in itself is of what is best in itself; and the highest thinking is of
the highest object.3

Phiwsophy

277

The intellect thinks itself by communion in the thinkable. For the intellect
becomes thinkable by touching and thinking. 4 So intellect and thinkable are the
same; for what is receptive of the thinkable and the essence is intellect. But when
it has it, it is active. So the divine feature which the intellect seems to have is the
former rather than the latter; and contemplation is the pleasantest and best.5 If
therefore God does as well always, as we do sometimes, it is wonderful; but if he
does better than we do, it is even more wonderful; and that is how it is.6
And life is present in him too. For the activity of intellect is life; but intellect is
the activity; and activity that is in itself is the intellect's best and eternal life. We
say that God is an eternal living thing, the best. So life and unceasing and eternal
duration belong to God. For this is what God is. 7
