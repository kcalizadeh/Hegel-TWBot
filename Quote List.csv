6,[kantian philosophy] was a justification from a philosophical quarter for the renunciation of speculative thought,113.0
7,There was seen the strange spectacle of a cultured nation without metaphysics−like a temple richly ornamented but without a holy of holies.,139.0

26,"The understanding determines, and holds the determinations fixed",64.0
27,"Reason is negative and dialectical, because it resolves the determinations of the understanding into nothing",108.0

35,But as a universal which is within itself concrete,50.0
36,A given particular is not subsumed under this universal ,56.0
37,"But in this determining, this positing of a difference, and the resolving of it, the particular has already determined itself",125.0
38,This movement is the absolute method of knowing and at the same time is the immanent soul of the content itself,111.0

53,It is an advantage when a language possesses an abundance of logical expressions,80.0
54,Many prepositions and articles denote relationships based on thought,68.0

56,To find the union of opposites naively shown in the dictionary as one word with opposite meanings,97.0
57,This result of speculative thinking is nonsensical to the understanding,71.0

85,"When in philo. reflection the categories are made to serve as means, then thinking is treated as subordinate to the other activities of mind",140.0

90,Universality which we are conscious ourselves of being,54.0
91,We are disposed to regard ourselves as caught up in these particular states and dominated by them,97.0
92,It is much more difficult to believe that the forms of thought which permeate all our ideas are tools for us rather than that we serve them,139.0
93,"When we give ourselves up to a sensation, a purpose, an interest, and in it feel ourselves confined and unfree,",111.0
94,"The place into which we can withdraw ourselves back into freedom is this region of self−certainty, of pure abstraction, of thought",130.0
95,"We call the nature or the essence of things their notion, and this is only for thought;",87.0

163,Reason is as cunning as it is powerful,38.0
164,"Logic on the contrary, cannot presuppose any of these forms of reflection and laws of thinking, for these constitute part of its own content",140.0
165,"What logic is cannot be stated beforehand, rather this knowledge of what it is first emergea as the final outcome of the whole exposition",137.0
166,The notion of logic has its genesis in the course of exposition and cannot therefore be premised,96.0
167,"But in the first place, it is quite inept to say that logic abstracts from all content",86.0
168,"As thinking and the rules of thinking are supposed to be the subject matter of logic, these directly constitute its peculiar content;",133.0
169,"Hitherto, the notion of logic has rested on the separation, ... of the content of cognition and its form, or of truth and certainty",131.0
170,"The object is regarded as something complete on its own account, something which can wholly dispense with thought for its actuality",131.0
171,It based itself on the fact that the knowledge of things obtained through thinking is alone what is really true in them,119.0
172,"Thus this metaphysic believed that thinking (and its determinations) is not anything alien to the object, but rather is its essential nature",140.0

174,The insight into the necessary conflict of the determinations of the understanding with themselves.,99.0
175,But equally it must transcend these its separating determinations and straightway connect them,94.0
176,It is at the stage of this connecting of the determinations that their conflict emerges.,88.0
177,This connecting activity of reflection belongs in itself to reason,66.0
178,"The rising above determinations, which attains an insight into their conflict, is the great negativestep towards the true notion of reason",138.0
179,"The insight, when not thorough−going, commits the mistake of thinking that it is reason which is in contradiction with itself;",126.0
180,It does not recognise that the contradiction is precisely the rising of reason above the limits of the understanding & the resolving of them,140.0
181,"[kant] attributes to us a correct perception, with the rider that nevertheless we cannot percieve what is true but only what is false",133.0
182,Determinations of finite & infinite conflict in the same way whether they are applied to to the world or are determinations within the mind,139.0

184,The forms of objective thinking are removed by this critique only from the thing; they are left in the subject just as they were originally,139.0
185,This abstract shadow divorced from all content - hegel,54.0
186,"But this attempt, because it proceeded from a subjective standpoint, could not be brought to a successful conclusion",116.0
187,The insubstantial nature of logical forms originates solely in the way in which they are considered and dealt with,114.0
188,The content which is missing in the logical forms is nothing else than a solid foundation and a concretion of these abstract determinations;,140.0
189,If logic is supposed to lack a substantial content the fault is not with its subject matter but with the way in which this matter is grasped,140.0
190," [logic] cannot be justified in any other way than by this emergence in consciousness, all the forms of which are resolved into this notion",139.0
191,A definition of science−or more precisely of logic−has its proof solely in the already mentioned necessity of its emergence in consciousness,140.0
192,"Argumentation is open to the most manifold and various opinions, on which a decision can finally be determined only arbitrarily",127.0
193,It is only in absolute knowing that separation of the object from the certainty of itself is completely eliminated,114.0
194,Thus pure science presupposes liberation from the opposition of consciousness.,78.0
195,"Logic is to be understood as the system of pure reason, as the realm of pure thought",84.0
196,One must discard the prejudice that truth must be something tangible.,69.0
197,Only in its notion does a thing possess actuality; to the extent that it is distinct from its notion it ceases to be actual & is a nonentity,140.0
198, now if logic has not undergone any change since aristotle ... then surely ... it is all the more in need of a total reconstruction; ,133.0
199,"The addition of psychological, pedagogic & physiological material which logic received in the past has now been recognised as disfigurement",139.0
200,The method is the consciousness of the form of the inner self−movement of the content of logic,94.0
201,The negative is just as much positive - hegel,45.0
202,"What is self−contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, ... but essentially only into the negation of its particular content",135.0
203,The result essentially contains that from which it results;,59.0
204,"Because the result, the negation, is a specific negation, it has content",72.0
205,"[the result of negation] is richer by the negation or opposite of its predecessor, therefore contains it, but also something more",129.0
206,The method which i follow in this system of logic −− or rather which this system in its own self follows −−,107.0
207,That which enables the notion to advance itself is the already mentioned negative which it possesses within itself,114.0
208,"If no advance is made beyond the abstract negative aspect of dialectic, the result is only that reason is incapable of knowing the infinite",139.0
209,It is only after profounder acquaintance with the other sciences that logic ceases to be for subjective spirit a merely abstract universal,138.0
210,The value of logic is only apprehended when it is preceded by experience of the sciences - hegel,96.0
211,"The system of logic is the realm of shadows, the world of simple essentialities freed from all sensuous concreteness",116.0
212,"In the philosophical treatment of classification, the notion itself must show that it is itself the course of those determinations. ",132.0
213,"In [logic] the opposition in consciousness between a subject, and a second an object, is known to be overcome; ",111.0
214,"Because they are at the same time known as distinct (yet not with an independent being), their unity is not abstract and inert, but concrete",140.0
215,"We must not understand the judgment as a resolving of a concrete unity back into its determinations, as if these had independent subsistence",140.0
216,It is easy to perceive that such an abstraction as the thing−in−itself is itself only a product of thought,106.0
217,"An object is a thought, and to determine it means partly, first to produce it, and partly, to have further thoughts about it",124.0
218,It is first and immediately ontology whose place is taken by objective logic,76.0
219,The subjective logic is the logic of the ... the subject itself,63.0
220,"What philosophy begins with must be either mediated or immediate, & it can be neither one nor the other; either way of beginning is refuted",139.0
221,In this science of manifested spirit the beginning is made from empirical consciousness - this is immediate knowledge in the strict sense,137.0
222,"Logic is pure science, that is, pure knowledge in the entire range of its development",85.0
223,"Thus the principle ought also to be the beginning, and what is the first for thought ought also to be the first in the process of thinking.",139.0
224,"There is nothing, nothing in heaven, or in nature or in mind or anywhere else which does not equally contain both immediacy and mediation",137.0
225,[mediation and immediacy] reveal themselves to be unseparated and inseparable and the opposition between them to be a nullity,125.0
226,All that is needed to ensure that the beginning remains immanent in its scientific development is simply to take up what is there before us.,140.0
227,"Pure knowing is without any distinction & as thus distinctionless, ceases itself to be knowledge; what is present is only simple immediacy",138.0
228,"This simple immediacy, therefore, in its true expression is pure being",70.0
229,"If no presupposition is made & the beginning itself is taken immediately, then its only determination is that it is the beginning of logic",138.0
230,Absolute truth must be a result,31.0
231,Thus consciousness on its onward path from the immediacy with which it began is led back to absolute knowledge as its innermost truth,133.0
232,The whole of the science of logic must be within itself a circle in which the first is also the last and the last is also the first. ,133.0
233,"Absolute spirit at the end of the development is known as freely externalising itself, abandoning itself to the shape of an immediate being ",140.0
234,"On the other hand, it is equally necessary to consider as result that into which the movement returns as into its ground",120.0
235,The progress from that which forms the beginning is to be regarded as only a further determination of it,104.0
236,That which forms the starting point of the development remains at the base of all that follows and does not vanish from it.,123.0
237,"This pure being is the unity into which pure knowing withdraws,",63.0
238,"Here at the start, where the subject matter itself is not yet to hand, philosophy is an empty word or some assumed, unjustified conception",138.0
239,"Pure being is to be considered as the unity into which knowing has collapsed at the extreme point of its union with the object,",127.0
240,"In the beginning, being and nothing are present as distinguished from each other;",81.0
241,"That which begins already is, but equally, too, is not as yet.",62.0
242,"That which constitutes the beginning, the beginning itself, is to be taken as something unanalysable, taken in its simple unfilled immediacy",140.0
243,"Absolute truth must be a result, and a result presupposes a prior truth",71.0
244,"Absolute spirit reveals itself as freely externalising itself, abandoning itself to the shape of an immediate being",115.0
245,It is equally necessary to consider as result that into which the movement returns as into its ground.,102.0
246,"The beginning of philosophy is present & preserved throughout the development, remaining completely immanent in its further determinations",138.0
247,"Because that which forms the beginning is still undeveloped, devoid of content, it is not truly known in the beginning;",119.0
248,It lies in the very nature of a beginning that it must be being and nothing else.,81.0
249,"Where the subject matter itself is not yet to hand, philosophy is an empty word or some assumed, unjustified conception",119.0
250,"That which begins already is, but equally, too, is not as yet.",62.0
251,"The opposites being and nonbeing are therefore directly united in the beginning, or, otherwise expressed, it is their undifferentiated unity",140.0
252,"In this sense, the abstract concept would be the first definition of the absolute & all further determinations only richer definitions of it",140.0
253,"The beginning cannot be made with anything concrete, anything containing a relation within itself",97.0
254,"That which constitutes the beginning, the beginning itself, must be taken as something unanalysable, taken in its simple unfilled immediacy",139.0
255,But the ego as such is at the same time the most concrete of all things −− the consciousness of itself as an infinitely manifold world. ,136.0
256,The pure knowing which has in truth overcome the opposition of consciousness.,77.0

93,"But in the second place, there are also many most important things outside of Philosophy, which are yet the work of Thought, and which are left unconsidered. 
 - HoP 1",167.0
94,"Such are Religion, Political History, forms of Government, and the Arts and Sciences. 
 - HoP 1",95.0
96,"Moreover, in the third place, we must first take a general survey before we descend to particulars, else the whole is not seen for the mere details-the wood is not seen for the trees, nor Philosophy for mere philosophies. 
 - HoP 1",231.0
97,"We require to have a general idea of the nature and aim of the whole in order to know what to look for. 
 - HoP 1",113.0
99,"This is nowhere more the case than with Philosophy, and also with its history. 
 - HoP 1",88.0
100,"In the case of a history, indeed, the establishment of the Universal seems to be less needful than in that of one of the sciences proper. 
 - HoP 1",147.0
101,"For history seems at first to be a succession of chance events, in which each fact stands isolated by itself, which has Time alone as a connecting-link. 
 - HoP 1",162.0
102,"But even in political history we are not satisfied with this. 
 - HoP 1",71.0
103,"We see, or at least divine in it, that essential connection in which the individual events have their place and relation to an end or aim, and in this way obtain significance. 
 - HoP 1",185.0
104,"For the significant in history is such only through its relation to and connection with a Universal. 
 - HoP 1",110.0
105,"To perceive this Universal is thus to apprehend the significance. 
 - HoP 1",75.0
106,"There are, therefore, the following points with which I wish to deal in this introduction. 
 - HoP 1",100.0
107,"The first of these will be to investigate the character of the history of Philosophy, its significance, its nature, and its aim, from which will follow inferences as to its treatment. 
 - HoP 1",193.0
108,"In particular, we shall get an insight into the relation of the history of Philosophy to the science of Philosophy, and this will be the most interesting point of all. 
 - HoP 1",177.0
109,"That is to say, this history represents, not merely the external, accidental, events contained within it, but it shows how the content, or that which appears to belong to mere history, really belongs to the science of Philosophy. 
 - HoP 1",239.0
110,"The history of Philosophy is itself scientific, and thus essentially becomes the science of Philosophy. 
 - HoP 1",113.0
113,"It might be supposed that the history of Philosophy should take account of all these ideas. 
 - HoP 1",101.0
117,"And I will not occupy further space with reflections on the use of the history of Philosophy, and other methods of treating it. 
 - HoP 1",137.0
118,"The use is evident. 
 - HoP 1",29.0
119,"But, in conclusion, I wish to consider the sources of the history of Philosophy, for this is customary. 
 - HoP 1",113.0
120,"THE thought which may first occur to us in the history of Philosophy, is that the subject itself contains an inner contradiction. 
 - HoP 1",139.0
121,"For Philosophy aims at understanding what is unchangeable, eternal, in and for itself: its end is Truth. 
 - HoP 1",114.0
122,"But history tells us of that which has at one time existed, at another time has vanished, having been expelled by something else. 
 - HoP 1",139.0
123,"Truth is eternal; it does not fall within the sphere of the transient, and has no history. 
 - HoP 1",100.0
124,"But if it has a history, and as this history is only the representation of a succession of past forms of knowledge, the truth is not to be found in it, for the truth cannot be what has passed away. 
 - HoP 1",207.0
126,"But in order to get a better understanding of this apparent contradiction, we must distinguish between the outward history of a religion or a science and the history of the subject itself. 
 - HoP 1",198.0
127,"And then we must take into account that the history of Philosophy because of the special nature of its subject-matter, is different from other histories. 
 - HoP 1",163.0
128,"It is at once evident that the contradiction in question could not refer to the outward history, but merely to the inward, or that of the content itself. 
 - HoP 1",163.0
129,"There is a history of the spread of Christianity and of the lives of those who have avowed it, and its existence has formed itself into that of a Church. 
 - HoP 1",163.0
130,"This in itself constitutes an external existence such that being brought into contact with temporal affairs of the most diverse kind, its lot is a varied one and it essentially possesses a history. 
 - HoP 1",207.0
131,"And of the Christian doctrine it is true that it, too, has its history, but it necessarily soon reached its full development and attained to its appointed powers. 
 - HoP 1",172.0
132,"And this old creed has been an acknowledged influence to every age, and will still be acknowledged unchanged as the Truth, even though this acknowledgment were become no more than a pretence, and the words an empty form. 
 - HoP 1",230.0
134,"The other sciences, including Philosophy, have also an external history like Religion. 
 - HoP 1",96.0
135,"Philosophy has a history of its origin, diffusion, maturity, decay, revival; a history of its teachers, promoters, and of its opponents-often, too, of an outward relation to religion and occasionally to the State. 
 - HoP 1",223.0
136,"This side of its history likewise gives occasion to interesting questions. 
 - HoP 1",84.0
141,"The content of Christianity, which is Truth, has, however, remained unaltered as such, and has therefore little history or as good as none. 
 - HoP 1",149.0
142,"Hence in Religion, on account of its very nature as Christianity, the conflict referred to disappears. 
 - HoP 1",112.0
143,"The errors and additions constitute no difficulty. 
 - HoP 1",60.0
144,"They are transitory and altogether historical in character. 
 - HoP 1",69.0
145,"The other sciences, indeed, have also according to their content a History, a part of which relates to alterations, and the renunciation of tenets which were formerly current. 
 - HoP 1",185.0
146,"But a great, perhaps the greater, part of the history relates to what has proved permanent, so that what was new, was not an alteration on earlier acquisitions, but an addition to them. 
 - HoP 1",195.0
147,"These sciences progress through a process of juxtaposition. 
 - HoP 1",69.0
149,"With a science like Mathematics, history has, in the main, only the pleasing task of recording further additions. 
 - HoP 1",123.0
150,"Thus to take an example, elementary geometry in so far as it was created by Euclid, may from his time on be regarded as having no further history. 
 - HoP 1",156.0
151,"The history of Philosophy, on the other hand, shows neither the motionlessness of a complete, simple content, nor altogether the onward movement of a peaceful addition of new treasures to those already acquired. 
 - HoP 1",221.0
152,"It seems merely to afford the spectacle of ever-recurring changes in the whole, such as finally are no longer even connected by a common aim. 
 - HoP 1",151.0
153,"At this point appear these ordinary superficial ideas regarding the history of Philosophy which have to be referred to and corrected. 
 - HoP 1",143.0
155,"The History of Philosophy as an accumulation of Opinions. 
 - HoP 1",67.0
156,"History, at the first glance, includes in its aim the narration of the accidental circumstances of times, of races, and of individuals, treated impartially partly as regards their relation in time, and partly as to their content. 
 - HoP 1",239.0
157,"The appearance of contingency in time-succession is to be dealt with later on. 
 - HoP 1",88.0
158,"It is contingency of content which is the idea with which we have first to deal-the idea of contingent actions. 
 - HoP 1",121.0
159,"But thoughts and not external actions, or griefs, or joys, form the content of Philosophy. 
 - HoP 1",100.0
160,"Contingent thoughts, however, are nothing but opinions, and philosophical opinions are opinions relating to the more special content of Philosophy, regarding God, Nature and Spirit. 
 - HoP 1",191.0
161,"Thus we now meet the view very usually taken of the history of Philosophy which ascribes to it the narration of a number of philosophical opinions as they have arisen and manifested themselves in time. 
 - HoP 1",211.0
163,"This view is not only held by those who recognize their ignorance of Philosophy. 
 - HoP 1",90.0
165,"But the same view is even held by those who write or have written on the history of Philosophy. 
 - HoP 1",105.0
166,"This history, considered only as the enumeration of various opinions, thus becomes an idle tale, or, if you will, an erudite investigation. 
 - HoP 1",149.0
167,"For erudition is, in the main, acquaintance with a number of useless things, that is to say, with that which has no intrinsic interest or value further than being known. 
 - HoP 1",179.0
168,"Yet it is thought that profit is to be derived from learning the various opinions and reflections of other men. 
 - HoP 1",121.0
169,"It stimulates the powers of thought and also leads to many excellent reflections; this signifies that now and then it occasions an idea, and its art thus consists in the spinning one opinion out of the other. 
 - HoP 1",218.0
172,"An opinion is a subjective conception, an uncontrolled thought, an idea which may occur to me in one direction or in another: an opinion is mine,3 it is in itself a universal thought which is existent in and for itself. 
 - HoP 1",229.0
173,"But Philosophy possesses no opinions, for there is no such thing as philosophical opinions. 
 - HoP 1",101.0
174,"When we hear a man speaking of philosophical opinions, even though he be an historian of philosophy itself, we detect at once this want of fundamental education. 
 - HoP 1",171.0
175,"Philosophy is the objective science of truth, it is science of necessity, conceiving knowledge, and neither opinion nor the spinning out of opinions. 
 - HoP 1",159.0
176,"The more precise significance of this idea is that we get to know opinions only, thus laying emphasis upon the word Opinion. 
 - HoP 1",134.0
177,"Now the direct opposite of opinion is the Truth; it is Truth before which mere opinion pales. 
 - HoP 1",103.0
178,"Those who in the history of Philosophy seek mere theories, or who suppose that on the whole only such are to be found within it, also turn aside when that word Truth confronts them. 
 - HoP 1",191.0
179,"Philosophy here encounters opposition from two different sides. 
 - HoP 1",73.0
181,"Of the relation existing between Religion and Philosophy and of its history, we shall deal later on. 
 - HoP 1",110.0
183,"But this affirmation of the right of reason is turned round in an astonishing manner, so that it results in making knowledge of the truth through reason an impossibility. 
 - HoP 1",180.0
184,"This so-called reason on the one hand has combated religious faith in the name and power of thinking reason, and at the same time it has itself turned against reason and is true reasons adversary. 
 - HoP 1",206.0
185,"Instinct and feeling are maintained by it against the true reason, thus making the measure of true value the merely subjective-that is a particular conviction such as each can form in and for himself in his subjective capacity. 
 - HoP 1",237.0
186,"A personal conviction such as this is no more than the particular opinion that has become final for men. 
 - HoP 1",114.0
187,"If we begin with what meets us in our very first conceptions, we cannot neglect to make mention of this aspect in the history of Philosophy. 
 - HoP 1",150.0
188,"In its results it permeates culture generally, being at once the misconception and true sign of our times. 
 - HoP 1",116.0
189,"It is the principle through which men mutually understand and know each other; an hypothesis whose value is established and which is the ground of all the other sciences. 
 - HoP 1",180.0
190,"In theology it is not so much the creed of the church that passes for Christianity, as that every one to a greater or less degree makes a Christianity of his own to tally with his conviction. 
 - HoP 1",201.0
192,"The endeavour to know the Truth is then of course relinquished. 
 - HoP 1",73.0
193,"It is true that personal conviction is the ultimate and absolute essential which reason and its philosophy, from a subjective point of view, demand in knowledge. 
 - HoP 1",171.0
195,"In the former case conviction is opinion. 
 - HoP 1",51.0
197,"It is the same opposition as that which existed in the decadence of Roman public and political life under Augustus, and subsequently when Epicureanism and indifference set themselves up against Philosophy. 
 - HoP 1",215.0
199,"Who makes this statement has gone beyond it indeed. 
 - HoP 1",61.0
201,"To the impartial man, the Truth has always been a heart-stirring word and one of great import. 
 - HoP 1",104.0
202,"As to the assertion that the Truth cannot be known, we shall consider it more closely in the history of Philosophy itself where it appears. 
 - HoP 1",149.0
205,"Proof of the futility of Philosophical Knowledge obtained through the History of Philosophy itself. 
 - HoP 1",109.0
206,"From another point of view another consequence ensues from the above conception of the history of Philosophy which may at will be looked at as an evil or a benefit. 
 - HoP 1",174.0
207,"In view of such manifold opinions and philosophical systems so numerous, one is perplexed to know which one ought to be accepted. 
 - HoP 1",139.0
208,"In regard to the great matters to which man is attracted and a knowledge of which Philosophy would bestow, it is evident that the greatest minds have erred, because they have been contradicted by others. 
 - HoP 1",213.0
211,"But this diversity in philosophical systems is far from being merely an evasive plea. 
 - HoP 1",95.0
212,"It has far more weight as a genuine serious ground of argument against the zeal which Philosophy requires. 
 - HoP 1",116.0
213,"It justifies its neglect and demonstrates conclusively the powerlessness of the endeavour to attain to philosophic knowledge of the truth. 
 - HoP 1",148.0
214,"When it is admitted that Philosophy ought to be a real science, and one Philosophy must certainly be the true, the question arises as to which Philosophy it is, and when it can be known. 
 - HoP 1",196.0
215,"Each one asserts its genuineness, each even gives different signs and tokens by which the Truth can be discovered; sober reflective thought must therefore hesitate to give its judgment. 
 - HoP 1",195.0
216,"This, then, is the wider interest which the history of Philosophy is said to afford. 
 - HoP 1",94.0
217,"Cicero  gives us from this point of view, a most slovenly history of philosophic thought on God. 
 - HoP 1",106.0
218,"He puts it in the mouth of an Epicurean, but he himself knew of nothing more favourable to say, and it is thus his own view. 
 - HoP 1",134.0
219,"The Epicurean says that no certain knowledge has been arrived at. 
 - HoP 1",75.0
221,"This fact, which cannot be denied, seems to contain the justification, indeed the necessity for applying to Philosophy the words of Christ, Let the dead bury their dead; arise, and follow Me. 
 - HoP 1",201.0
225,"Behold the philosophy by which thine own will be refuted and displaced shall not tarry long as it has not tarried before. 
 - HoP 1",131.0
226,"Explanatory remarks on the diversity in Philosophies. 
 - HoP 1",63.0
227,"Certainly the fact is sufficiently well established that there are and have been different philosophies. 
 - HoP 1",114.0
228,"The Truth is, however, one; and the instinct of reason maintains this irradicable intuition or belief. 
 - HoP 1",112.0
229,"It is said that only one philosophy can be true, and, because philosophies are different, it is concluded that all others must be erroneous. 
 - HoP 1",150.0
230,"But, in fact, each one in turn gives every assurance, evidence and proof of being the one and true Philosophy. 
 - HoP 1",120.0
231,"This is a common mode of reasoning and is what seems in truth to be the view of sober thought. 
 - HoP 1",104.0
232,"As regards the sober nature of the word at issue-thought-we can tell from every-day experience that if we fast we feel hunger either at once or very soon. 
 - HoP 1",164.0
233,"But sober thought always has the fortunate power of not resulting in hunger and desire, but of being and remaining as it is, content. 
 - HoP 1",143.0
234,"Hence the thought expressed in such an utterance reveals the fact that it is dead understanding; for it is only death which fasts and yet rests satisfied. 
 - HoP 1",164.0
235,"But neither physical life nor intellectual remains content with mere abstention; as desire it presses on through hunger and through thirst towards Truth, towards knowledge itself. 
 - HoP 1",189.0
236,"It presses on to satisfy this desire and does not allow itself to feast and find sufficiency in a reflection such as this. 
 - HoP 1",132.0
237,"As to this reflection, the next thing to be said of it is that however different the philosophies have been, they had a common bond in that they were Philosophy. 
 - HoP 1",171.0
238,"Thus whoever may have studied or become acquainted with a philosophy, of whatever kind, provided only that it is such, has thereby become acquainted with Philosophy. 
 - HoP 1",175.0
240,"But it is really important to have a deeper insight into the bearings of this diversity in the systems of Philosophy. 
 - HoP 1",127.0
241,"Truth and Philosophy known philosophically, make such diversity appear in another light from that of abstract opposition between Truth and Error. 
 - HoP 1",155.0
242,"The explanation of how this comes about will reveal to us the significance of the whole history of Philosophy. 
 - HoP 1",120.0
245,"Further we find that in the history of Philosophy we have to deal with Philosophy itself. 
 - HoP 1",99.0
246,"The facts within that history are not adventures and contain no more romance than does the history of the world. 
 - HoP 1",122.0
247,"They are not a mere collection of chance events, of expeditions of wandering knights, each going about fighting, struggling purposelessly, leaving no results to show for all his efforts. 
 - HoP 1",196.0
248,"Nor is it so that one thing has been thought out here, another there, at will; in the activity of thinking mind there is real connection, and what there takes place is rational. 
 - HoP 1",187.0
249,"It is with this belief in the spirit of the world that we must proceed to history, and in particular to the history of Philosophy. 
 - HoP 1",140.0
250,"The above statement, that the Truth is only one, is still abstract and formal. 
 - HoP 1",88.0
251,"In the deeper sense it is our starting point. 
 - HoP 1",55.0
253,"Thus what is most essential is to know that the single truth is not merely a solitary, empty thought, but one determined within itself. 
 - HoP 1",145.0
254,"To obtain this knowledge we must enter into some abstract Notions which, as such, are quite general and dry, and which are the two principles of Development and of the Concrete. 
 - HoP 1",187.0
255,"We could, indeed, embrace the whole in the single principle of development; if this were clear, all else would result and follow of its own accord. 
 - HoP 1",157.0
256,"The product of thinking is the thought; thought is, however, still formal; somewhat more defined it becomes Notion, and finally Idea is Thought in its totality, implicitly and explicitly determined. 
 - HoP 1",208.0
257,"Thus the Idea, and it alone is Truth. 
 - HoP 1",47.0
258,"Now it is essentially in the nature of the Idea to develop, and only through development to arrive at comprehension of itself, or to become what it is. 
 - HoP 1",161.0
259,"That the Idea should have to make itself what it is, seems like a contradiction; it may be said that it is what it is. 
 - HoP 1",128.0
260,"The idea of development is well known, but it is the special characteristic of Philosophy to investigate such matters as were formerly held as known. 
 - HoP 1",159.0
261,"What is dealt with or made use of without consideration as an aid to daily life, is certainly the unknown to man unless he be informed in Philosophy. 
 - HoP 1",159.0
262,"The further discussion of this idea belongs to the science of Logic. 
 - HoP 1",78.0
263,"In order to comprehend what development is, what may be called two different states must be distinguished. 
 - HoP 1",116.0
264,"The first is what is known as capacity, power, what I call being-in-itself ; the second principle is that of being-for-itself, actuality. 
 - HoP 1",147.0
266,"But while the child only has capacities or the actual possibility of reason, it is just the same as if he had no reason; reason does not yet exist in him since he cannot yet do anything rational, and has no rational consciousness. 
 - HoP 1",240.0
267,"Thus what man is at first implicitly becomes explicit, and it is the same with reason. 
 - HoP 1",96.0
268,"If, then, man has actuality on whatever side, he is actually rational; and now we come to reason. 
 - HoP 1",107.0
269,"What is the real meaning of this word? That which is in itself must become an object to mankind, must arrive at consciousness, thus becoming for man. 
 - HoP 1",159.0
270,"What has become an object to him is the same as what he is in himself; through the becoming objective of this implicit being, man first becomes for himself; he is made double, is retained and not changed into another. 
 - HoP 1",227.0
271,"For example, man is thinking, and thus he thinks out thoughts. 
 - HoP 1",72.0
272,"In this way it is in thought alone that thought is object; reason produces what is rational: reason is its own object. 
 - HoP 1",128.0
273,"The fact that thought may also descend to what is destitute of reason is a consideration involving wider issues, which do not concern us here. 
 - HoP 1",152.0
275,"The whole variation in the development of the world in history is founded on this difference. 
 - HoP 1",103.0
278,"This constitutes the enormous difference in their condition. 
 - HoP 1",70.0
279,"All knowledge, and learning, science, and even commerce have no other object than to draw out what is inward or implicit and thus to become objective. 
 - HoP 1",160.0
280,"Because that which is implicit comes into existence, it certainly passes into change, yet it remains one and the same, for the whole process is dominated by it. 
 - HoP 1",170.0
281,"The plant, for example, does not lose itself in mere indefinite change. 
 - HoP 1",81.0
282,"From the germ much is produced when at first nothing was to be seen; but the whole of what is brought forth, if not developed, is yet hidden and ideally contained within itself. 
 - HoP 1",187.0
283,"The principle of this projection into existence is that the germ cannot remain merely implicit, but is impelled towards development, since it presents the contradiction of being only implicit and yet not desiring so to be. 
 - HoP 1",232.0
284,"But this coming without itself has an end in view; its completion fully reached, and its previously determined end is the fruit or produce of the germ, which causes a return to the first condition. 
 - HoP 1",207.0
285,"The germ will produce itself alone and manifest what is contained in it, so that it then may return to itself once more thus to renew the unity from which it started. 
 - HoP 1",176.0
286,"With nature it certainly is true that the subject which commenced and the matter which forms the end are two separate units, as in the case of seed and fruit. 
 - HoP 1",168.0
287,"The doubling process has apparently the effect of separating into two things that which in content is the same. 
 - HoP 1",121.0
288,"Thus in animal life the parent and the young are different individuals although their nature is the same. 
 - HoP 1",115.0
289,"In Mind it is otherwise: it is consciousness and therefore it is free, uniting in itself the beginning and the end. 
 - HoP 1",125.0
290,"As with the germ in nature, Mind indeed resolves itself back into unity after constituting itself another. 
 - HoP 1",116.0
291,"But what is in itself becomes for Mind and thus arrives at being for itself. 
 - HoP 1",86.0
293,"That for which the other  is, is the same as that other;  and thus alone Mind is at home with itself in its other. 
 - HoP 1",124.0
294,"The development of Mind lies in the fact that its going forth and separation constitutes its coming to itself. 
 - HoP 1",120.0
295,"This being-at-home-with-self, or coming-to-self of Mind may be described as its complete and highest end: it is this alone that it desires and nothing else. 
 - HoP 1",166.0
297,"Only in this manner does Mind attain its freedom, for that is free which is not connected with or dependent on another. 
 - HoP 1",129.0
298,"True self-possession and satisfaction are only to be found in this, and in nothing else but Thought does Mind attain this freedom. 
 - HoP 1",140.0
299,"In sense-perception, for instance, and in feeling, I find myself confined and am not free; but I am free when I have a consciousness of this my feeling. 
 - HoP 1",162.0
300,"Man has particular ends and interests even in will; I am free indeed when this is mine. 
 - HoP 1",97.0
301,"Such ends, however, always contain another,  or something which constitutes for me another,  such as desire and impulse. 
 - HoP 1",130.0
302,"It is in Thought alone that all foreign matter disappears from view, and that Mind is absolutely free. 
 - HoP 1",112.0
303,"All interest which is contained in the Idea and in Philosophy is expressed in it. 
 - HoP 1",91.0
304,"As to development, it may be asked, what does develop and what forms the absolute content? Development is considered in the light of a formal process in action and as destitute of content. 
 - HoP 1",198.0
305,"But the act has no other end but activity, and through this activity the general character of the content is already fixed. 
 - HoP 1",133.0
306,"For being-in-self and being-for-self are the moments present in action; but the act is the retention of these diverse elements within itself. 
 - HoP 1",151.0
307,"The act thus is really one, and it is just this unity of differences which is the concrete. 
 - HoP 1",101.0
308,"Not only is the act concrete, but also the implicit, which stands to action in the relation of subject which begins, and finally the product is just as concrete as the action or as the subject which begins. 
 - HoP 1",216.0

400,"The first question which may be asked in reference to this history, concerns that distinction in regard to the manifestation of the Idea, which has just been noticed. 
 - HoP 1",176.0
401,"It is the question as to how it happens that Philosophy appears to be a development in time and has a history. 
 - HoP 1",120.0
402,"The answer to this question encroaches on the metaphysics of Time, and it would be a digression from our object to give here more than the elements on which the answer rests. 
 - HoP 1",184.0
403,"It has been shown above in reference to the existence of Mind, that its Being is its activity. 
 - HoP 1",104.0
404,"Nature, on the contrary, is, as it is; its changes are thus only repetitions, and its movements take the form of a circle merely. 
 - HoP 1",139.0

 - HoP 1",73.0

408,"But consciousness really implies that for myself, I am object to myself. 
 - HoP 1",82.0
409,"In forming this absolute division between what is mine and myself, Mind constitutes its existence and establishes itself as external to itself. 
 - HoP 1",153.0
410,"It postulates itself in the externality which is just the universal and the distinctive form of existence in Nature. 
 - HoP 1",126.0
411,"But one of the forms of externality is Time, and this form requires to be further examined both in the Philosophy of Nature and the finite Mind. 
 - HoP 1",154.0
412,"This Being in existence and therefore Being in time is a moment not only of the individual consciousness, which as such is essentially finite, but also of the development of the philosophical Idea in the element of Thought. 
 - HoP 1",233.0
413,"For the Idea, thought of as being at rest, is, indeed, not in Time. 
 - HoP 1",77.0
414,"To think of it as at rest, and to preserve it in the form of immediacy is equivalent to its inward perception.

421,"The higher stage, on the other hand, centuries later reveals itself in another race of people. 
 - HoP 1",104.0
426,"Philosophy in its concrete Idea is the activity of development in revealing the differences which it contains within itself; these differences are thoughts, for we are now speaking of development in Thought. 
 - HoP 1",217.0
427,"In the first place, the differences which rest in the Idea are manifested as thoughts. 
 - HoP 1",96.0
428,"Secondly, these distinctions must come into existence, one here and the other there; and in order that they may do this, they must be complete, that is, they must contain within themselves the Idea in its totality.

429,"The concrete alone as including and supporting the distinctions, is the actual; it is thus, and thus alone, that the differences are in their form entire. 
 - HoP 1",164.0
430,"A complete form of thought such as is here presented, is a Philosophy. 
 - HoP 1",80.0
431,"But the Idea contains the distinctions in a peculiar form. 
 - HoP 1",68.0
433,"But everything hangs on this: these forms are nothing else than the original distinctions in the Idea itself, which is what it is only in them. 
 - HoP 1",153.0
434,"They are in this way essential to, and constitute the content of the Idea, which in thus sundering itself, attains to form. 
 - HoP 1",133.0
435,"The manifold character of the principles which appear, is, however, not accidental, but necessary: the different forms constitute an integral part of the whole form. 
 - HoP 1",175.0
436,"They are the determinations of the original Idea, which together constitute the whole; but as being outside of one another, their union does not take place in them, but in us, the observers. 
 - HoP 1",200.0
437,"Each system is determined as one, but it is not a permanent condition that the differences are thus mutually exclusive. 
 - HoP 1",129.0
438,"The inevitable fate of these determinations must follow, and that is that they shall be drawn together and reduced to elements or moments.

 - HoP 1",78.0
442,"It may seem as if this progression were to go on into infinitude, but it has an absolute end in view, which we shall know better later on; many turnings are necessary, however, before Mind frees itself in coming to consciousness.

 - HoP 1",62.0

 - HoP 1",51.0
1540,"The second satisfaction is in the belief of securing liberty through ascetic exercises, pains, torments, and penances.

1541,"The third has to do with time-the idea that liberty will come in the course of time and without study. 
 - HoP 1",112.0
1542,"The fourth satisfaction is obtained in a belief in luck-in believing that liberty depends on fate. 
 - HoP 1",108.0
1543,"The external mode of obtaining satisfaction relates to continence from enjoyment, but continence from sensuous motives, such as dislike to the unrest of acquisition, and fear of the evil consequences of enjoyment.

1544,"There are, again, several means of perfecting the intelligence adduced, and, amongst others, there is the direct psychological mode of perfecting mind, as is seen in the act of reasoning, in friendly converse, and so on. 
 - HoP 1",230.0
1545,"This we may find, indeed, in our applied logic. 
 - HoP 1",57.0
1546,"There is still somewhat to be remarked as to the main points of the system. 
 - HoP 1",85.0
1547,"The Sanchya, and likewise the other Indian systems of Philosophy, occupy themselves particularly with the three qualities  of the absolute Idea, which are represented as substances and as modifications of nature. 
 - HoP 1",222.0
1548,"It is noteworthy that in the observing consciousness of the Indians it struck them that what is true and in and for itself contains three determinations, and the Notion of the Idea is perfected in three moments. 
 - HoP 1",221.0
1549,"This sublime consciousness of the trinity, which we find again in Plato and others, then went astray in the region of thinking contemplation, and retains its place only in Religion, and there but as a Beyond. 
 - HoP 1",218.0
1550,"Then the understanding penetrated through it, declaring it to be senseless; and it was Kant who broke open the road once more to its comprehension. 
 - HoP 1",157.0
1551,"The reality and totality of the Notion of everything, considered in its substance, is absorbed by the triad of determinations; and it has become the business of our times to bring this to consciousness. 
 - HoP 1",212.0
1553,"It prevails in fire, and therefore flames rise up and sparks fly upwards; if it has ascendency in men, as it does have in the eight higher orders, it is the origin of virtue. 
 - HoP 1",184.0
1554,"This also is the universal-throughout and in every aspect the affirmative-in abstract form. 
 - HoP 1",101.0
1556,"The third and last quality is darkness ; it is inert and obstructive, allied to care, dullness, and disappointment, predominating in earth and water, and hence these fall down and tend ever downwards. 
 - HoP 1",210.0
1557,"With living beings stupidity takes its origin in this. 
 - HoP 1",64.0
1560,"With the Indians the third is still change and negation. 
 - HoP 1",66.0
1561,"These three qualities are represented as the essential being of nature. 
 - HoP 1",81.0
1562,"The Sanchya says, We speak of them as we do of the trees in a wood. 
 - HoP 1",77.0
1563,"Yet this is a bad simile, for the wood is but an abstract universal, in which the individuals are independent. 
 - HoP 1",120.0
1565,"Further determinations of the intelligence in respect of these qualities follow. 
 - HoP 1",90.0
1567,"This last is eight-fold, and hence eight special qualities are given as being present; viz. 
 - HoP 1",101.0
1570,"The Sanchya ascribes this power to man, in so far as he elevates himself through the working of his thought into inward subjectivity. 
 - HoP 1",143.0
1573,"But the quickest mode of reaching happiness through deep contemplation is that worship of God which consists in ever murmuring the mystic name of God, Om. 
 - HoP 1",164.0
1574,"This idea is a very general one. 
 - HoP 1",42.0
1575,"Colebrooke deals more particularly with the theistic and atheistic divisions of the Sanchya as distinguished. 
 - HoP 1",119.0
1578,"But, he says, the existence of effects depends on the soul, on consciousness, and not on Iswara. 
 - HoP 1",106.0
1579,"Everything proceeds from the great Principle, which is Intelligence;  to this the individual soul belongs, and through this it is brought about. 
 - HoP 1",154.0

1583,"They perceive that effects exist even before the operation of the causes; for what does not exist cannot be made explicit in existence through causality.

 - HoP 1",100.0
2070,"The advance made by the determination of the principle as infinite in comprehensiveness rests in the fact that absolute essence no longer is a simple universal, but one which negates the finite.

2071,"At the same time, viewed from the material side, Anaximander removes the individuality of the element of water; his objective principle does not appear to be material, and it may be understood as Thought.

 - HoP 1",195.0
2079,"As to the further question of how the infinite determines the opposite in its separation, it seems that the theory of the quantitative distinction of condensation and rarefaction was held by Anaximander as well as by Thales.

2117,"We shall leave these now and go on to Pythagoras, who was a contemporary of Anaximander; but the continuity of the development of the principle of physical philosophy necessitated our taking Anaximenes with him. 
 - HoP 1",221.0
2118,"We see that, as Aristotle said, they placed the first principle in a form of matter-in air and water first, and then, if we may so define Anaximanders matter, in an essence finer than water and coarser than air.

2119,"Heraclitus, of whom we have soon to speak, first called it fire.

2124,"No one recognized better the deficiencies in this philosophy than did Aristotle in the work already quoted. 
 - HoP 1",117.0
2125,"Two points appear in his criticism of these three modes of determining the absolute: Those who maintain the original principle to be matter fall short in many ways.

2130,"Matter is indeed itself immaterial as this reflection into consciousness; but such philosophers do not know that what they express is an existence of consciousness.

2131,"Thus the first great defect here rests in the fact that the universal is expressed in a particular form. 
 - HoP 1",114.0
2132,"Secondly, Aristotle says : From this it may be seen that first cause has only been by all these expressed in the form of matter.

2141,"This origination is to be shown as separation or as union, and hence the contradiction comes about that one in time comes earlier than the other.

2296,"What first strikes us as surprising is the boldness of such language, which at once sets aside everything which to the ordinary idea is real and true, doing away with sensuous existence and making it to be the creation of thought. 
 - HoP 1",240.0
2297,"Existence is expressed as something which is not sensuous, and thus what to the senses and to old ideas is altogether foreign, is raised into and expressed as substance and as true Being.

2298,"But at the same time the necessity is shown for making number to be likewise Notion, to manifest it as the activity of its unity with Being, for to us number does not seem to be in immediate unity with the Notion. 
 - HoP 1",223.0
2299,"Now although this principle appears to us to be fanciful and wild, we find in it that number is not merely something sensuous, therefore it brings determination with it, universal distinctions and antitheses.

 - HoP 1",68.0
2311,"The enigmatic character of the determination through number is what most engages our attention. 
 - HoP 1",105.0
2314,"Hence number is not immediate Notion, but only a beginning of thought, and a beginning in the worst possible way; it is the Notion in its extremest externality, in quantitative form, and in that of indifferent distinction. 
 - HoP 1",232.0
2315,"In so far, the one has within itself both the principle of thought and that of materiality, or the determination of the sensuous. 
 - HoP 1",139.0
2317,"On the other hand, in the number three, for instance, there are always three units, of which each is independent; and this is what constitutes both their defect and their enigmatic character. 
 - HoP 1",201.0
2318,"For since the essence of the Notion is innate, numbers are the most worthless instruments for expressing Notion-determinations. 
 - HoP 1",137.0
2319,"Now the Pythagoreans did not accept numbers in this indifferent way, but as Notion. 
 - HoP 1",93.0
2320,"At least they say that phenomena must be composed of simple elements, and it would be contrary to the nature of things if the principle of the universe pertained to sensuous phenomena. 
 - HoP 1",194.0
2321,"The elements and principles are thus not only intangible and invisible, but altogether incorporeal. 
 - HoP 1",109.0
2325,"In the Pythagoreans we see the necessity for one enduring universal idea as a thought-determination. 
 - HoP 1",110.0
2326,"Aristotle , speaking of ideas, says: According to Heraclitus, everything sensuous flows on, and thus there cannot be a science of the sensuous; from this conviction the doctrine of ideas sprang. 
 - HoP 1",204.0
2328,"It is impossible to discern what interest this in itself can have; the only thing which is necessary for us as regards the Pythagoreans, is to recognize any indications of the Idea, in which there may be a progressive principle.

2329,"This is the whole of the Pythagorean philosophy taken generally. 
 - HoP 1",74.0
2330,"We now have to come to closer quarters, and to consider the determinations, or universal significance. 
 - HoP 1",112.0
2331,"In the Pythagorean system numbers seem partly to be themselves allied to categories-that is, to be at once the thought-determinations of unity, of opposition and of the unity of these two moments. 
 - HoP 1",206.0
2333,"The first determination is unity generally, the next duality or opposition. 
 - HoP 1",85.0
2334,"It is most important to trace back the infinitely manifold nature of the forms and determinations of finality to their universal thoughts as the most simple principles of all determination. 
 - HoP 1",199.0
2335,"These are not differences of one thing from another, but universal and essential differences within themselves. 
 - HoP 1",121.0
2336,"Empirical objects distinguish themselves by outward form; this piece of paper can be distinguished from another, shades are different in colour, men are separated by differences of temperament and individuality. 
 - HoP 1",221.0
2339,"Necessary progression and proof are not to be sought for here; comprehension, the development of duality out of unity are wanting. 
 - HoP 1",140.0
2340,"Universal determinations are only found and established in a quite dogmatic form, and hence the determinations are dry, destitute of process or dialectic, and stationary. 
 - HoP 1",180.0
2341,"The Pythagoreans say that the first simple Notion is unity ; not the discrete, multifarious, arithmetic one, but identity as continuity and positivity, the entirely universal essence. 
 - HoP 1",193.0
2342,"They further say, according to Sextus : All numbers come under the Notion of the one; for duality is one duality and triplicity is equally a one, but the number ten is the one chief number. 
 - HoP 1",199.0
2343,"This moved Pythagoras to assert unity to be the principle of things, because, through partaking of it, each is called one. 
 - HoP 1",132.0
2344,"That is to say, the pure contemplation of the implicit being of a thing is the one, the being like self; to all else it is not implicit, but a relationship to what is other. 
 - HoP 1",183.0
2345,"Things, however, are much more determined than being merely this dry one. 
 - HoP 1",83.0
2346,"The Pythagoreans have expressed this remarkable relationship of the entirely abstract one to the concrete existence of things through simulation. 
 - HoP 1",155.0
2347,"The same difficulty which they here encounter is also found in Platos Ideas; since they stand over against the concrete as species, the relation of concrete to universal is naturally an important point. 
 - HoP 1",212.0
2348,"Aristotle  ascribes the expression participation   to Plato, who took it in place of the Pythagorean expression simulation. 
 - HoP 1",133.0
2349,"Simulation is a figurative, childish way of putting the relationship; participation is undoubtedly more definite. 
 - HoP 1",123.0
2350,"But Aristotle says, with justice, that both are insufficient; that Plato has not here arrived at any further development, but has only substituted another name. 
 - HoP 1",170.0
2351,"To say that ideas are prototypes and that other things participate in them is empty talk and a poetic metaphor; for what is the active principle that looks upon the ideas?. 
 - HoP 1",182.0
2352,"Simulation and participation are nothing more than other names for relation; to give names is easy, but it is another thing to comprehend. 
 - HoP 1",148.0
2353,"What comes next is the opposition, the duality , the distinction, the particular; such determinations have value even now in Philosophy; Pythagoras merely brought them first to consciousness. 
 - HoP 1",201.0
2354,"Now, as this unity relates to multiplicity, or this being-like-self to being another, different applications are possible, and the Pythagoreans have expressed themselves variously as to the forms which this first opposition takes. 
 - HoP 1",240.0
2355,"They said, according to Aristotle : The elements of number are the even and the odd; the latter is the finite   and the former is the infinite; thus the unity proceeds from both and out of this again comes number. 
 - HoP 1",223.0
2356,"The elements of immediate number are not yet themselves numbers: the opposition of these elements first appears in arithmetical form rather than as thought. 
 - HoP 1",166.0
2357,"But the one is as yet no number, because as yet it is not quantity; unity and quantity belong to number. 
 - HoP 1",114.0
2358,"Theon of Smyrna42 says: Aristotle gives, in his writings on the Pythagoreans, the reason why, in their view, the one partakes of the nature of even and odd; that is, one, posited as even, makes odd; as odd, it makes even. 
 - HoP 1",231.0
2359,"This is what it could not do unless it partook of both natures, for which reason they also called the one, even-odd. 
 - HoP 1",126.0
2360,"If we follow the absolute Idea in this first mode, the opposition will also be called the undetermined duality. 
 - HoP 1",121.0
2363,"Duality is just as essential a moment in the Notion as is unity. 
 - HoP 1",74.0
2364,"Comparing them with one another, we may either consider the unity to be form and duality matter, or the other way; and both appear in different modes. 
 - HoP 1",160.0
2365,"Unity, as the being-like-self, is the formless; but in duality, as the unlike, there comes division or form. 
 - HoP 1",118.0
2366,"If, on the other hand, we take form as the simple activity of absolute form, the one is what determines; and duality as the potentiality of multiplicity, or as multiplicity not posited, is matter. 
 - HoP 1",206.0
2368,"He also ascribes this to Plato, that instead of showing the undetermined to be simple , he made of it a duality-the great and small. 
 - HoP 1",142.0
2369,"Further consideration of this opposition, in which Pythagoreans differ from one another, shows us the imperfect beginning of a table of categories which were then brought forward by them, as later on by Aristotle. 
 - HoP 1",223.0
2370,"Hence the latter was reproached for having borrowed these thought-determinations from them; and it certainly was the case that the Pythagoreans first made the opposite to be an essential moment in the absolute. 
 - HoP 1",220.0
2371,"They further determined the abstract and simple Notions, although it was in an inadequate way, since their table presents a mixture of antitheses in the ordinary idea and the Notion, without following these up more fully.

 - HoP 1",205.0
2384,"We find the further progress of these determinations in Sextus , when he speaks about an exposition of the later Pythagoreans. 
 - HoP 1",136.0
2385,"It is a very good and well considered account of the Pythagorean theories, which has some thought in it. 
 - HoP 1",114.0
2386,"The exposition follows these lines: The fact that these two principles are the principles of the whole, is shown by the Pythagoreans in manifold ways. 
 - HoP 1",160.0
2387,"There are three methods of thinking things; firstly, in accordance with diversity, secondly, with opposition, and thirdly, according to relation. 
 - HoP 1",155.0
2388,"What is considered in its mere diversity, is considered for itself; this is the case with those subjects in which each relates only to itself, such as horse, plant, earth, air, water and fire. 
 - HoP 1",202.0
2389,"Such matters are thought of as detached and not in relation to others. 
 - HoP 1",80.0
2390,"This is the determination of identity with self or of independence. 
 - HoP 1",77.0
2392,"One is only comprehensible from the other; for I cannot tell which is my left excepting by my right. 
 - HoP 1",110.0
2393,"Each of these relations in its opposition, is likewise set up for itself in a position of independence. 
 - HoP 1",113.0
2394,"The difference between relationship and opposition is that in opposition the coming into existence of the one is at the expense of the other, and conversely. 
 - HoP 1",167.0
2395,"If motion is taken away, rest commences; if motion begins, rest ceases; if health is taken away, sickness begins, and conversely. 
 - HoP 1",139.0
2396,"In a condition of relationship, on the contrary, both take their rise, and both similarly cease together; if the right is removed, so also is the left; the double goes and the half is destroyed. 
 - HoP 1",204.0
2397,"What is here taken away is taken not only as regards its opposition, but also in its existence. 
 - HoP 1",105.0
2398,"A second difference is that what is in opposition has no middle; for example, between sickness and health, life and death, rest and motion, there is no third. 
 - HoP 1",168.0
2399,"Relativity, on the contrary, has a middle, for between larger and smaller there is the like; and between too large and too small the right size is the medium. 
 - HoP 1",168.0
2400,"Pure opposition passes through nullity to opposition; immediate extremes, on the other hand, subsist in a third or middle state, but in such a case no longer as opposed. 
 - HoP 1",179.0
2401,"This exposition shows a certain regard for universal, logical determinations, which now and always have the greatest possible importance, and are moments in all conceptions and in everything that is. 
 - HoP 1",209.0
2402,"The nature of these opposites is, indeed, not considered here, but it is of importance that they should be brought to consciousness. 
 - HoP 1",142.0
2403,"Now since these three represent three different genera, the subjects and the two-fold opposite, there must be a higher genus over each of them which takes the first place, since the genus comes before its subordinate kinds. 
 - HoP 1",233.0
2404,"If the universal is taken away, so is the kind; on the other hand, if the kind, not the genus, for the former depends on the latter, but not the contrary way. 
 - HoP 1",168.0
2405,"The Pythagoreans have declared the one to be the highest genus of what is considered as in and for itself  ; this is, properly speaking, nothing more than translating the determinations of the Notion into numbers. 
 - HoP 1",223.0
2406,"What is in opposition has, they say, as its genus the like and the unlike; rest is the like, for it is capable of nothing more and nothing less; but movement is the unlike. 
 - HoP 1",182.0
2407,"Thus what is according to nature is like itself; it is a point which is not capable of being intensified ; what is opposed to it is unlike. 
 - HoP 1",149.0
2408,"Health is like, sickness is unlike. 
 - HoP 1",45.0
2409,"The genus of that which is in an indifferent relationship is excess and want, the more and the less;  in this we have the quantitative relation just as we formerly had the qualitative. 
 - HoP 1",194.0
2410,"We now come for the first time to the two opposites: These three genera of what is for itself, in opposition and in relationship, must now come under -yet simpler, higher-genera,  ie thought-determinations. 
 - HoP 1",216.0
2411,"Similarity reduces itself to the determination of unity. 
 - HoP 1",66.0
2412,"The genus of the subjects is the very being on its own account. 
 - HoP 1",73.0
2413,"Dissimilarity, however, consists of excess and want, but both of these come under undetermined duality;  they are the undetermined opposition, opposition generally. 
 - HoP 1",174.0
2414,"Thus from all these relationships the first unity and the undetermined duality proceed;  the Pythagoreans said that such are found to be the universal modes of things. 
 - HoP 1",177.0
2415,"From these, there first comes the one of numbers and the two of numbers; from the first unity, the one; from the unity and the undetermined duality the two; for twice the one is two. 
 - HoP 1",192.0
2416,"The other numbers take their origin in a similar way, for the unity over moves forward, and the undetermined duality generates the two. 
 - HoP 1",145.0
2417,"This transition of qualitative into quantitative opposition is not clear. 
 - HoP 1",83.0
2419,"The nature of these determinations is to be found in transition and in movement. 
 - HoP 1",90.0
2420,"The deeper significance of this reflection rests in the connection of universal thought-determinations with arithmetic numbers-in subordinating these and making the universal genus first. 
 - HoP 1",197.0
2421,"Before I say anything of the further sequence of these numbers, it must be remarked that they, as we see them represented here, are pure Notions. 
 - HoP 1",155.0

 - HoP 1",178.0
2485,"That is to say, if we begin with the point, the first negation of vacuity, the point corresponds to unity; it is indivisible and the principle of lines, as the unity is that of numbers.

 - HoP 1",229.0
2498,"The differences here show themselves as various relations of numbers, and this mode of determining what is musical is the only one. 
 - HoP 1",141.0
2499,"The relation borne by tones to one another is founded on quantitative differences whereby harmonies may be formed, in distinction to others by which discords are constituted. 
 - HoP 1",184.0
2500,"The Pythagoreans, according to Porphyry , treated music as something soul-instructing and scholastic Psychagogisches und PÃ¤dagogisches. 
 - HoP 1",146.0
2501,"Pythagoras was the first to discern that musical relations, these audible differences, are mathematically determinable, that what we hear as consonance and dissonance is a mathematical arrangement. 
 - HoP 1",207.0
2502,"The subjective, and, in the case of hearing, simple feeling which, however, exists inherently in relation, Pythagoras has justified to the understanding, and he attained his object by means of fixed determinations.

2503,"For to him the discovery of the fundamental tones of harmony are ascribed, and these rest on the most simple number-relations. 
 - HoP 1",136.0
2505,"And finally he applied the same, and experimented in strings, by which means there were three different relations presented to him-Diapason, Diapente, and Diatessaron. 
 - HoP 1",177.0
2506,"It is known that the tone of a string, or, in the wind instrument, of its equivalent, the column of air in a reed, depends on three conditions; on its length, on its thickness, and on the amount of tension. 
 - HoP 1",216.0
2507,"Now if we have two strings of equal thickness and length, a difference in tension brings about a difference in sound. 
 - HoP 1",127.0
2508,"If we want to know what tone any string has, we have only to consider its tension, and this may be measured by the weight depending from the string, by means of which it is extended. 
 - HoP 1",192.0
2510,"A different number of vibrations in like times determines the height and depth of the tone, and this number is likewise proportionate to the weight, if thickness and length are equal. 
 - HoP 1",193.0
2511,"In the first case, the more distended string makes as many vibrations again as the other; in the second case, it makes three vibrations for the others two, and so it goes on. 
 - HoP 1",184.0
2512,"Here number is the real factor which determines the difference, for tone, as the vibration of a body, is only a quantitatively determined quiver or movement, that is, a determination made through space and time. 
 - HoP 1",221.0
2513,"For there can be no determination for the difference excepting that of number or the amount of vibrations in one time; and hence a determination made through numbers is nowhere more in place than here. 
 - HoP 1",211.0
2515,"From this point the Pythagoreans enter into further applications of the theory of music, in which we cannot follow them. 
 - HoP 1",130.0
2517,"But in all that treats of the further construction of the universe as a numerical system, we have the whole extent of the confusion and turbidity of thought belonging to the later Pythagoreans. 
 - HoP 1",203.0
2518,"We cannot say how much pains they took to express philosophic thought in a system of numbers, and also to understand the expressions given utterance to by others, and to put in them all the meaning possible. 
 - HoP 1",217.0
2519,"When they determined the physical and the moral universe by means of numbers, everything came into indefinite and insipid relationships in which the Notion disappeared. 
 - HoP 1",178.0
2520,"In this matter, however, so far as the older Pythagoreans are concerned, we are acquainted with the main principles only. 
 - HoP 1",131.0
2521,"Plato exemplifies to us the conception of the universe as a system of numbers, but Cicero and the ancients always call these numbers the Platonic, and it does not appear that they were ascribed to the Pythagoreans. 
 - HoP 1",224.0
2522,"It was thus later on that this came to be said; even in Ciceros time they had become proverbially dark, and there is but little after all that is really old. 
 - HoP 1",167.0
2523,"The Pythagoreans further constructed the heavenly bodies of the visible universe by means of numbers, and here we see at once the barrenness and abstraction present in the determination of numbers. 
 - HoP 1",207.0
2526,"These nine are, first the milky way, or the fixed stars, and after that the seven stars which were then all held to be planets: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Sun, Moon, and in the last and ninth place, the Earth. 
 - HoP 1",235.0
2527,"The tenth is thus the Antichthone, and in regard to this it must remain uncertain whether the Pythagoreans considered it to be the side of the Earth which is turned away, or as quite another body. 
 - HoP 1",206.0
2528,"Aristotle says, in reference to the specially physical character of these spheres , Fire was by the Pythagoreans placed in the middle, but the Earth was made a star that moved around this central body in a circle. 
 - HoP 1",223.0
2529,"This circle is, then, a sphere, which, as the most perfect of figures, corresponds to the dekad. 
 - HoP 1",106.0
2530,"We here find a certain similarity to our ideas of the solar system, but the Pythagoreans did not believe the fire to be the sun. 
 - HoP 1",138.0
2532,"This fire, that which is in the centre, they called Jupiters place of watch. 
 - HoP 1",86.0
2533,"Now these ten spheres make, like all that is in motion, a tone; but each makes a different one, according to the difference in its size and velocity. 
 - HoP 1",159.0
2536,"We have, comprehended here in thought, a system of the universe; the solar system is alone rational to us, for the other stars are devoid of interest. 
 - HoP 1",160.0
2537,"To say that there is music in the spheres, and that these movements are tones, may seem just as comprehensible to us as to say that the sun is still and the earth moves, although both are opposed to the dictates of sense. 
 - HoP 1",231.0
2538,"For, seeing that we do not see the movement, it may be that we do not hear the notes. 
 - HoP 1",95.0
2539,"And there is little difficulty in imagining a universal silence in these vast spheres, since we do not hear the chorus, but it is more difficult to give a reason for not hearing this music. 
 - HoP 1",199.0
2540,"The Pythagoreans say, according to the last quoted passage of Aristotle, that we do not hear it because we live in it, like the smith who gets accustomed to the blows of his hammer. 
 - HoP 1",191.0
2541,"Since it belongs to our substance and is identical with ourselves, nothing else, such as silence, by which we might know the other, comes into relationship with us, for we are conceived of as entirely within the movement. 
 - HoP 1",231.0
2543,"We may thus set aside sound; the music of the spheres is indeed a wonderful conception, but it is devoid of any real interest for us. 
 - HoP 1",143.0
2544,"If we retain the conception that motion, as measure, is a necessarily connected system of numbers, as the only rational part of the theory, we must maintain that nothing further has transpired to the present day.

 - HoP 1",218.0
2550,"The Pythagoreans also applied their principle to the Soul, and thus determined what is spiritual as number.

 - HoP 1",78.0

 - HoP 1",187.0
2683,"If we say of God that this the highest Being is outside of and over us, we can know nothing more of it but that it is, and thus it is the undetermined; for if we knew of determinations, this would be to possess knowledge. 
 - HoP 1",231.0
2684,"The truth then simply is that God is the One, not in the sense that there is one God , but only that He is identical with Himself; in this there is no other determination, any more than in the utterance of the Eleatic school. 
 - HoP 1",235.0
2686,"With this the dialectic reasoning of the Eleatics is closely connected in respect that they have also proved that nothing can originate or pass away.

2693,"The unity of God is further proved by Xenophanes: If God is the mightiest, He must be One; for were He two or more, He would not have dominion over the others, but, not having dominion over the others, He could not be God. 
 - HoP 1",232.0
2694,"Thus were there several, they would be relatively more powerful or weaker, and thus they would not be gods, for Gods nature is to have nothing mightier than He.

 - HoP 1",115.0
2704,"The one does not move itself, nor is it unmoved; to be unmoved is non-being, for to it none other comes, nor does it go into another; but to be moved must mean to be several, for one must move into another.

2709,"The nothing is like nothing and does not pass into Being or conversely; thus nothing can originate from like. 
 - HoP 1",119.0
2710,"This, the oldest mode of argument, holds its place even to the present day, as, for example, in the so-called proof of the unity of God. 
 - HoP 1",146.0
2711,"This proceeding consists of making presuppositions such as the power of God, and from them drawing conclusions and denying the existence of predicates; that is the usual course in our mode of reasoning. 
 - HoP 1",212.0
2712,"In respect of determinations, it must be remarked that they, as being negative, are all kept apart from the positive and merely real being. 
 - HoP 1",149.0
2714,"It is the same separation, only that we also allow the finite to be Being, which the Eleatics deny. 
 - HoP 1",109.0
2715,"Or else we too proceed from finite things to kinds and genera, leaving the negative out bit by bit; and the highest order of all is God, who, as the highest Being, is affirmative only, but devoid of any determination. 
 - HoP 1",227.0
2716,"Or we pass from what is finite to the infinite, for we say that the finite as limited must have its basis in the infinite.

2717,"In all these different forms which are quite familiar to us, there is the same difficult question which exists in reference to the Eleatic thought. 
 - HoP 1",157.0

2722,"For what he thinks to speak most perfectly   He knows that not at all; his own opinions cleave to all.

2724,"Thus philosophers come into this world as into a great house to seek the truth, but were they to reach it, they could not tell whether they really had attained to it. 
 - HoP 1",176.0
2725,"The indefinite expressions of Xenophanes might also merely mean that none knows that which he  here makes known. 
 - HoP 1",122.0
2726,"In the second passage Sextus puts it thus: Xenophanes does not make all knowledge void, but only the scientific and infallible; opinionative knowledge is, however, left. 
 - HoP 1",179.0
2727,"He expresses this in saying that opinion cleaves to all. 
 - HoP 1",66.0
2728,"So that with him the criterion is made to be opinion, ie the apparent, and not that which is firm and sure; Parmenides, on the contrary, condemns opinion. 
 - HoP 1",164.0
2729,"But from his doctrine of the One, there follows the annihilation of ordinary ideas, which is what he did in the foregoing dialectic; it is evident, however, that nobody could know the truth which he hereby utters. 
 - HoP 1",223.0
2730,"If a thought such as this passed through ones head, one could not tell that it was true, and in such a case it would only be an opinion. 
 - HoP 1",146.0
2731,"We here find in Xenophanes a double consciousness; a pure consciousness and consciousness of Being, and a consciousness of opinion. 
 - HoP 1",141.0
2732,"The former was to him the consciousness of the divine, and it is the pure dialectic, which is negatively related to all that is determined and which annuls it.

2957,"Zeno now brings forward four different arguments against motion; the proofs rest on the infinite divisibility of space and time. 
 - HoP 1",138.0
2958,"This is his first form of argument:-Movement has no truth, because what is in motion must first reach the middle of the space before arriving at the end.

 - HoP 1",72.0
3482,"Aristotle shows the trace of universality present here; for to him it may be termed essential in dealing with the Notion of the principle, that which is in and for itself. 
 - HoP 1",181.0
3483,"But this is only the Notion, or the thought which is present in and for itself; we have not yet seen such a principle, for we find it first in Anaxagoras. 
 - HoP 1",164.0
3484,"If Aristotle found the principle of motion missed in ancient philosophers, in the Becoming of Heraclitus, he again missed in Heraclitus the still deeper principle of the Good, and hence wished to discover it in Empedocles. 
 - HoP 1",232.0
3486,"Aristotle thus entirely controverts Heraclitus, because his principle is change alone, without remaining like self, maintaining self, and going back within self. 
 - HoP 1",171.0
3488,"That is, when the All falls asunder through strife amongst the elements, fire is thereby united into one, and so is each of the other elements. 
 - HoP 1",153.0
3490,"But when everything through friendship goes back into one, it is necessary that the parts of each element undergo separation again. 
 - HoP 1",141.0
3491,"The being in one is itself a manifold, a diverse relation of the four diversities, and thus the going together is likewise a separation. 
 - HoP 1",146.0
3492,"This is the case generally with all determinateness, that it must in itself be the opposite, and must manifest itself as such. 
 - HoP 1",136.0
3493,"The remark that, speaking generally, there is no union without separation, no separation without union, is a profound one; identity and non-identity are thought-determinations of this kind which cannot be separated. 
 - HoP 1",225.0
3494,"The reproach made by Aristotle is one that lies in the nature of the thing. 
 - HoP 1",85.0
3497,"What would be most interesting is the determination of their relationship. 
 - HoP 1",84.0
3499,"Aristotle says with justice  that Empedocles contradicts both himself and appearances. 
 - HoP 1",96.0
3500,"For at one time he maintains that none of the elements springs out of the other, but all else comes from them; and, at another time, he makes them into a whole through friendship, and again destroys this unity through strife. 
 - HoP 1",235.0
3501,"Thus through particular differences and qualities, one becomes water, the other fire, &c Now if the particular differences are taken away , it is evident that water arises from earth, and the reverse.

3511,"The connection of his philosophy with what precedes is as follows: In Heraclitus Idea as motion, all moments are absolutely vanishing. 
 - HoP 1",144.0
3512,"Empedocles represents the gathering together of this motion into a unity, but into a synthetic unity; and with Leucippus and Democritus it is the same. 
 - HoP 1",161.0
3513,"With Empedocles, however, the moments of this unity are the existent elements of fire, water, &c, and with the others, pure abstractions, implicit being, thoughts. 
 - HoP 1",173.0
3514,"But in this way universality is directly asserted, for the opposing elements have no longer any sensuous support. 
 - HoP 1",123.0
3517,"The unity as universal, returns from the opposition into itself, while in the synthesis of Empedocles, what is opposed is still apart from it and independent, and Thought is not Being.

3848,"It was the Sophists who now applied the simple Notion as thought  to worldly objects generally, and with it penetrated all human relations. 
 - HoP 1",149.0
3852,"For we call culture just the Notion as applied in actuality, in so far as it makes its appearance not purely in its abstraction, but in unity with the manifold content of all ordinary conceptions. 
 - HoP 1",206.0
3853,"But in culture, the Notion is the predominant as also the actuating, because in both the determinate is recognized in its limits, in its transition into something else. 
 - HoP 1",178.0
3854,"This culture became the general aim of education, and there were hence a number of teachers of Sophistry. 
 - HoP 1",115.0
3855,"Indeed, the Sophists are the teachers of Greece through whom culture first came into existence in Greece, and thus they took the place of poets and of rhapsodists, who before this were the ordinary instructors. 
 - HoP 1",220.0
3856,"For religion was no instructress, since no teaching was in it imparted; and though priests certainly offered sacrifices, prophesied and interpreted the sayings of the oracle, instruction is something quite different from this. 
 - HoP 1",236.0
3857,"But the Sophists educated men in wisdom, in the sciences, music, mathematics, &c, and this was their foremost aim. 
 - HoP 1",124.0
3859,"For the end of the State is the universal, under which the particular is comprehended. 
 - HoP 1",96.0
3861,"Now culture is certainly an indefinite expression. 
 - HoP 1",60.0
3862,"It has, however, this meaning, that what free thought is to attain must come out of itself and be personal conviction; it is then no longer believed but investigated-in short, it is the so-called enlightenment of modern times. 
 - HoP 1",236.0
3863,"Thought seeks general principles by which it criticizes everything which is by us esteemed, and nothing has value to us which is not in conformity with these principles. 
 - HoP 1",179.0
3865,"These aspects, which are properly not independent, but only moments of a whole, when detached from it, relate themselves to themselves, and in this way assume the form of universality. 
 - HoP 1",194.0
3866,"Any one of them can thus be elevated to a reason, ie to a universal determination, which is again applied to particular aspects. 
 - HoP 1",138.0
3869,"A man of culture thus knows how to say something of everything, to find points of view in all. 
 - HoP 1",104.0
3870,"Greece has to thank the Sophists for this culture, because they taught men to exercise thought as to what should have authority for them, and thus their culture was culture in philosophy as much as in eloquence. 
 - HoP 1",221.0
3871,"In order to reach this double end, the Sophists were one in their desire to be wise. 
 - HoP 1",94.0
3872,"To know what constitutes power amongst men and in the State, and what I have to recognize as such, is counted as wisdom; and because I know the power, I also know how to direct others in conformity with my end. 
 - HoP 1",220.0

 - HoP 1",206.0
3877,"They further had the most ordinary practical end, to give a consciousness of that which is involved in the moral world and which satisfies man. 
 - HoP 1",153.0
3878,"Religion taught that the gods are the powers which rule over men. 
 - HoP 1",75.0
3879,"Immediate morality recognized the rule of laws; man was to find satisfaction in conforming to laws, and was to assume that others also find satisfaction because they follow these laws. 
 - HoP 1",194.0
3881,"Thus the impulses and desires that man has, become his power; and only inasmuch as he affords them satisfaction does he become satisfied. 
 - HoP 1",147.0
3882,"Now the Sophists taught how these powers could be moved in empirical man, for the good as ordinarily recognized, no longer determined them. 
 - HoP 1",149.0
3883,"Rhetoric, however, teaches how circumstances may be made subject to such forces; it even makes use of the wrath and passions of the hearer in order to bring about a conclusion. 
 - HoP 1",186.0
3888,"This is the position taken up by the Sophists. 
 - HoP 1",56.0
3889,"But we find a perfectly definite picture of their further progress and procedure in Platos Protagoras. 
 - HoP 1",112.0
3890,"Plato here makes Protagoras express himself more precisely respecting the art of the Sophists. 
 - HoP 1",104.0
3892,"On the way, Socrates now asks Hippocrates what is this wisdom of the Sophists which he wishes to learn. 
 - HoP 1",113.0
3893,"Hippocrates at first replies Rhetoric, for the Sophist is one who knows how to make men clever  in speech. 
 - HoP 1",116.0
3894,"In fact, what is most striking in a man or people of culture is the art of speaking well, or of turning subjects round and considering them in many aspects. 
 - HoP 1",166.0
3895,"The uncultivated man finds it unpleasant to associate with people who know how to grasp and express every point of view with ease.

3897,"We may have mastered a speech quite completely, but if we have not culture, it is not good speaking. 
 - HoP 1",110.0

 - HoP 1",105.0
3899,"What is to be obtained from the Sophists is thus the power of keeping the manifold points of view present to the mind, so that the wealth of categories by which an object may be considered, immediately occurs to it. 
 - HoP 1",225.0
3900,"Socrates, indeed, remarks that the principle of the Sophists is not hereby determined in a sufficiently comprehensive way, and thus it is not sufficiently known what a Sophist is, yet,  he says, we have a desire to go on. 
 - HoP 1",231.0
3901,"For likewise, if anyone wishes to study Philosophy, he does not as yet know what Philosophy is, else he would not need to study it.

3904,"Protagoras praises his discretion, and replies that they act wisely to make use of this precaution. 
 - HoP 1",109.0
3906,"On this point Protagoras speaks at length: I assert that the art of the Sophists is old; but that those of the ancients who practised it in fear of giving offence   veiled and concealed it. 
 - HoP 1",199.0
3907,"One section, like Homer and Hesiod, taught it in their poetry; others, like Orpheus and MusÃ¦us, through mysteries and oracles. 
 - HoP 1",137.0
3908,"Some, I believe, like Iccus of Tarentum, and the Sophist now living and unsurpassed-Herodicus, of Selymbria-in gymnastics, but many more through music. 
 - HoP 1",161.0
3909,"We see that Protagoras usually describes the end of mental culture as being to bring about morality, presence of mind, sense of order and general capacity. 
 - HoP 1",165.0
3910,"He adds: all those who feared envy arising against the sciences, required such veils and screens. 
 - HoP 1",107.0

 - HoP 1",159.0
3914,"Further on, where the arts which Hippocrates was to acquire under Protagoras instruction were discussed, Protagoras answered Socrates: What you ask is sensible, and I like to answer a sensible question.

3915,"Hippocrates will not have the same experience that he would have with other teachers. 
 - HoP 1",95.0

 - HoP 1",74.0
4201,"Socrates, whose birth occurs in the fourth year of the 77th Olympiad , was the son of Sophroniscus, a sculptor, and of PhÃ¦narete, a midwife.

 - HoP 1",175.0
4208,"Another feature in his life was that he fulfilled the duty of protecting his country, which rested on him as an Athenian citizen. 
 - HoP 1",139.0

 - HoP 1",97.0

4216,"In this campaign it is said that once, sunk in deep meditation, he stood immovable on one spot the whole day and night, until the morning sun awoke him from his trance-a condition in which he is said often to have been. 
 - HoP 1",229.0
4217,"This was a cataleptic state, which may bear some relation to magnetic somnambulism, in which Socrates became quite dead to sensuous consciousness.

4219,"In him we see pre-eminently the inwardness of consciousness that in an anthropological way existed in the first instance in him, and became later on a usual thing.

4433,"We understand from this the following criticism which Aristotle makes  on the quality of virtue as expounded by Socrates. 
 - HoP 1",131.0
4434,"He says: Socrates spoke better of virtue than did Pythagoras, but not quite justly, for he made virtues into a science. 
 - HoP 1",129.0
4435,"But this is impossible, since, though all knowledge has some basis  this basis only exists in thought. 
 - HoP 1",112.0
4436,"Consequently, he places all the virtues in the thinking  side of the soul. 
 - HoP 1",84.0
4437,"Hence it comes to pass that he does away with the feeling  part of the soul, that is, the inclination  and the habits ,  which, however, also pertain to virtue. 
 - HoP 1",170.0
4438,"But Plato rightly distinguished the thinking and the feeling sides of the soul. 
 - HoP 1",89.0
4439,"This is a good criticism. 
 - HoP 1",35.0
4440,"We see that what Aristotle misses in the determination of virtue in Socrates, is the side of subjective actuality, which we now call the heart. 
 - HoP 1",153.0
4441,"Certainly virtue is determination in accordance with universal, and not with particular ends, but perception is not the only element in virtue. 
 - HoP 1",153.0
4443,"If we understand the reality of the good as universal morality, substantiality is wanting to the perception; but matter, when we regard the inclination of the individual subjective will as this reality. 
 - HoP 1",212.0
4445,"Socrates thus omits, in characterizing virtue, just what we saw had also disappeared in actuality, that is, first the real spirit of a people, and then reality as the sympathies of the individual. 
 - HoP 1",206.0
4446,"For it is just when consciousness is not yet turned back into itself, that the universal good appears to the individual as the object of his sympathy. 
 - HoP 1",160.0
4448,"But in order that the universal should be reality, it must be worked out through consciousness as individual, and the carrying into effect pertains to this individuality.

4450,"Yet this is not the place in which to unravel all the false ideas and contradictions present in our culture. 
 - HoP 1",118.0
4451,"Aristotle , supplementing the one-sidedness of Socrates, further says of him: Socrates in one respect worked on right lines, but not in the other. 
 - HoP 1",156.0
4452,"For to call virtue scientific knowledge is untrue, but to say that it is not without scientific basis is right. 
 - HoP 1",121.0
4453,"Socrates made virtues into perceptions , but we say that virtue exists with perception. 
 - HoP 1",97.0
4454,"This is a very true distinction; the one side in virtue is that the universal of end belongs to thought. 
 - HoP 1",114.0
4455,"But in virtue, as character, the other side, active individuality, real soul, must necessarily come forth; and indeed with Socrates the latter appears in a characteristic form of which we shall speak below. 
 - HoP 1",216.0
4456,"If we consider the universal first, it has within it a positive and a negative side, which we find both united in Xenophons Memorabilia,  a work which aims at justifying Socrates. 
 - HoP 1",189.0
4458,"But in regard to the content of his teaching and the point reached by him in the development of thought, we have in the main to look to Xenophon. 
 - HoP 1",155.0
4459,"The fact that the reality of morality had become shaken in the mind of the people, came to consciousness in Socrates; he stands so high because he gave expression to what was present in the times. 
 - HoP 1",206.0
4462,"To the Notion too, because to it the determinateness of laws in the form in which they have value to unperceiving consciousness has dissolved, only the purely implicit universal Good is the true. 
 - HoP 1",205.0
4463,"But since this is empty and without reality, we demand, if we are not satisfied with a dull monotonous round, that again a movement should be made towards the extension of the determination of the universal. 
 - HoP 1",217.0
4464,"Now because Socrates remains at the indeterminateness of the good, its determination means for him simply the expression of the particular good. 
 - HoP 1",154.0
4467,"But since the dialectic sublates the particular, the abstract universal also becomes shaken. 
 - HoP 1",102.0
4469,"That is, he showed them the good and true in what is determined, going back into it because he did not wish to remain in mere abstraction. 
 - HoP 1",148.0
4470,"Xenophon gives an example of this  in a dialogue with the Sophist Hippias. 
 - HoP 1",84.0
4471,"Socrates there asserts that the just man is he who obeys the law, and that these laws are divine. 
 - HoP 1",107.0
4473,"But Socrates answers by demanding if those who conduct war do not again make peace, which is not, any more than in the other case, to condemn war, for each was just in its turn. 
 - HoP 1",187.0
4474,"Socrates thus says, in a word, that the best and happiest State is that in which the citizens are of one mind and obedient to law. 
 - HoP 1",140.0
4475,"Now this is the one side in which Socrates looks away from the contradiction and makes laws and justice, as they are accepted by each individually, to be the affirmative content. 
 - HoP 1",188.0
4478,"Euthydemus declares that this undoubtedly is so. 
 - HoP 1",58.0
4479,"But without justice, replies Socrates, this is not possible, and he further asks whether Euthydemus had thus attained to justice in himself. 
 - HoP 1",150.0
4480,"Euthydemus answers affirmatively, for he says that he thinks he is no less just than any other man. 
 - HoP 1",109.0
4481,"Socrates now replies, Just as workmen can show their work, the just will be able to say what their works are. 
 - HoP 1",119.0
4482,"This he also agrees to, and replies that he could easily do so. 
 - HoP 1",73.0
4484,"Now Socrates asks, But if a general subdues the enemys State, would this not be justice?  Euthydemus says Yes. 
 - HoP 1",120.0
4485,"Socrates replies, Likewise if he deceives and robs the enemy and makes slaves?  Euthydemus has to admit the justice of this. 
 - HoP 1",134.0
4486,"It is thus shown that the same qualities come under the determination both of justice and of injustice. 
 - HoP 1",113.0
4487,"Here it strikes Euthydemus to add the qualification that he intended that Socrates should understand the action to be only in reference to friends; as regards them it is wrong. 
 - HoP 1",186.0
4489,"Socrates says, If a father gives a sick child a medicine which it does not wish to take, in its food, and makes it well through deceit, is this right?  Euthydemus-Yes. 
 - HoP 1",177.0
4490,"Socrates-Or is anyone wrong who takes arms from his friend secretly or by force, when he sees him in despair, and in the act of taking his own life?  Euthydemus has to admit that this is not wrong. 
 - HoP 1",207.0
4491,"Thus it is again shown here, that as regards friends also, the same determinations have to hold good on both sides, as justice as well as injustice. 
 - HoP 1",158.0
4492,"Here we see that abstention from lying, deceit, and robbery, that which we naturally hold to be established, contradicts itself by being put into connection with something different, and something which holds equally good. 
 - HoP 1",232.0
4493,"This example further explains how through thought, which would lay hold of the universal in the form of the universal only, the particular becomes uncertain. 
 - HoP 1",167.0
4499,"Thus if we here consider further what is the true in this consciousness, we pass on to the mode in which the realization of the universal appeared to Socrates himself. 
 - HoP 1",177.0
4501,"That is, though this consciousness expresses the universal law, Thou shalt not kill,  as a duty, that consciousness-if no cowardly spirit dwells within it-will still bravely attack and slay the enemy in war. 
 - HoP 1",217.0
4502,"Here, if it is asked whether there is a command to kill ones enemies, the reply would be affirmative, as likewise when a hangman puts to death a criminal. 
 - HoP 1",164.0
4503,"But when in private life we become involved with adversaries, this command to kill ones enemies will not occur to us. 
 - HoP 1",127.0
4504,"We may thus call this the mind which thinks at the right time, first of the one, and then of the other; it is spirit, but an unspiritual consciousness. 
 - HoP 1",161.0
4505,"The first step towards reaching a spiritual consciousness is the negative one of acquiring freedom for ones consciousness. 
 - HoP 1",132.0
4506,"For since perception attempts to prove individual laws, it proceeds from a determination to which, as a universal basis, particular duty is submitted; but this basis is itself not absolute, and falls under the same dialectic. 
 - HoP 1",235.0
4508,"The so-called conflict of duties is nothing but duty, which is expressed as absolute, showing itself as not absolute; in the constant contradiction morals become unsettled. 
 - HoP 1",182.0
4509,"For a consciousness which has become consistent, law, because it has then been brought into contact with its opposite, has been sublated. 
 - HoP 1",147.0
4510,"For the positive truth has not yet become known in its determination. 
 - HoP 1",79.0
4511,"But to know the universal in its determination, ie the limitation of the universal which comes to us as fixed and not contingent, is only possible in connection with the whole system of actuality. 
 - HoP 1",206.0
4512,"Thus if with Socrates the content has become spiritualized, yet manifold independent grounds have merely taken the place of manifold laws. 
 - HoP 1",148.0
4513,"For the perception is not yet expressed as the real perception of these grounds over which it rules; but the truth of consciousness simply is this very movement of pure perception. 
 - HoP 1",190.0
4514,"The true ground is, however, spirit, and the spirit of the people-a perception of the constitution of a people, and the connection of the individual with this real universal spirit. 
 - HoP 1",191.0
4515,"Laws, morals, the actual social life, thus have in themselves their own corrective against the inconsistent, which consists of the expression of a definite content as absolute. 
 - HoP 1",186.0
4516,"In ordinary life we merely forget this limitation of universal principles, and these still hold their place with us; but the other point of view is thus when the limitation comes before our consciousness. 
 - HoP 1",214.0
4518,"Now both sides here present, the universal law and the deciding spirit which is in its abstraction the active individual, are also necessary to the consciousness of Socrates as the content and the power over this content. 
 - HoP 1",231.0
4520,"Thus with Socrates the deciding spirit is transformed into the subjective consciousness of man, since the power of deciding originates with himself; and the first question now is, how this subjectivity appears in Socrates himself. 
 - HoP 1",240.0
4521,"Because the person, the individual, now gives the decision, we come back to Socrates as person, as subject, and what follows is a development of his personal relations.

4530,"For conscience is the idea of universal individuality, of the mind certain of itself, which is at the same time universal truth.

4532,"His pure consciousness stands over both sides. 
 - HoP 1",56.0
4533,"The deficiency in the universal, which lies in its indeterminateness, is unsatisfactorily supplied in an individual way, because Socrates judgment, as coming from himself, was characterized by the form of an unconscious impulse.

 - HoP 1",115.0
4579,"The attacks which Socrates experienced are well known, and were from two sources; Aristophanes attacked him in the Clouds,  and then he was formally accused before the people. 
 - HoP 1",185.0
4580,"Aristophanes regarded the Socratic philosophy from the negative side, maintaining that through the cultivation of reflecting consciousness, the idea of law had been shaken, and we cannot question the justice of this conception. 
 - HoP 1",237.0
4581,"Aristophanes consciousness of the one-sidedness of Socrates may be regarded as a prelude to his death; the Athenian people likewise certainly recognized his negative methods in condemning him.

4584,"As to the first, it should not startle us, nor do we require to justify Aristophanes or to excuse him. 
 - HoP 1",112.0
4587,"By chronological considerations, some have tried hard to refute the fact that Aristophanes representations had no influence on the condemnation of Socrates. 
 - HoP 1",166.0
4588,"It is seen that, on the one hand, Socrates was treated quite unjustly; but then we must recognize the merit of Aristophanes, who in his Clouds  was perfectly right. 
 - HoP 1",174.0
4589,"This poet, who exposed Socrates to scorn in the most laughable and bitter way, was thus no ordinary joker and shallow wag who mocked what is highest and best, and sacrificed all to wit with a view to making the Athenians laugh. 
 - HoP 1",237.0
4590,"For everything has to him a much deeper basis, and in all his jokes there lies a depth of seriousness.

4594,"It is, generally speaking, not possible to joke in an external way about what does not contain matter for joking or irony in itself. 
 - HoP 1",142.0

 - HoP 1",206.0
4596,"Hence, when Aristophanes makes merry over the Democracy, there is a deep political earnestness at heart, and from all his works it appears what a noble, excellent, true Athenian citizen he was.

4597,"We thus have a real patriot before us, who, though it involved the punishment of death, did not fear in one of his works to counsel peace.

 - HoP 1",161.0

 - HoP 1",218.0
4604,"Aristophanes made fun of the fact that Socrates occupied himself with elementary researches as to how far fleas spring, and of his putting wax on their feet in order to discover this.

4617,"Strepsiades ends the comedy with execrations on the Socratic dialectic, with a return to his old ways, and with the burning of Socrates house. 
 - HoP 1",152.0
4618,"The exaggeration which may be ascribed to Aristophanes, is that he drove this dialectic to its bitter end, but it cannot be said that injustice is done to Socrates by this representation. 
 - HoP 1",197.0
4619,"Indeed we must admire the depth of Aristophanes in having recognized the dialectic side in Socrates as being a negative, and-though after his own way-in having presented it so forcibly. 
 - HoP 1",195.0
4620,"For the power of judging in Socrates method is always placed in the subject, in conscience, but where this is bad, the story of Strepsiades must repeat itself. 
 - HoP 1",169.0
4622,"A man like Socrates, who had made right   the sole standard of his action, and did not stray from the straight path, must necessarily make many enemies   who are accustomed to act from quite different motives.

 - HoP 1",165.0
4625,"This phenomenon is probably explained by the fact that the enemies of Socrates had first of all to gain time in order to obtain a following, and that under the rule of the Thirty, they played too insignificant a part,  and so on. 
 - HoP 1",239.0
4626,"Now, as regards the trial of Socrates, we have to distinguish two points, the one the matter of the accusation, the judgment of the court, and the other the relation of Socrates to the sovereign people. 
 - HoP 1",212.0
4627,"In the course of justice there are thus these two parts-the relation of the accused to the matter on account of which he is accused, and his relation to the competency of the people, or the recognition of their majesty. 
 - HoP 1",229.0
4628,"Socrates was found guilty by the judges in respect of the content of his accusation, but was condemned to death because he refused to recognize the competency and majesty of the people as regards the accused. 
 - HoP 1",218.0
4629,"The accusation consisted of two points: That Socrates did not consider as gods those who were held to be such by the Athenian people, but introduced new ones; and that he also led young men astray. 
 - HoP 1",207.0
4630,"The leading away of youth was his casting doubt on what was held to be immediate truth. 
 - HoP 1",97.0
4633,"But Socrates, who placed the contingency of judgment in himself, since he had his DÃ¦mon in his own consciousness, thereby abolished the external universal DÃ¦mon from which the Greeks obtained their judgments. 
 - HoP 1",220.0
4634,"This accusation, as also Socrates defence, we wish now to examine further; Xenophon represents both to us, and Plato has also supplied us with an Apology. 
 - HoP 1",164.0
4635,"Meanwhile we may not rest content with saying that Socrates was an excellent man who suffered innocently, &c , for in this accusation it was the popular mind of Athens that rose against the principle which became fatal to him.

 - HoP 1",230.0
4648,"Men do not believe that to him, to this individual, there has been a revelation. 
 - HoP 1",90.0
4650,"This unbelief, which thus does not deny the general fact and general possibility, but believes it in no particular case, really does not believe in the actuality and truth of the thing. 
 - HoP 1",195.0
4652,"The absolute consciousness does not know about the future as such, any more than about the past; it knows only about the present. 
 - HoP 1",139.0
4653,"But because in its present, in its thought, the opposition of future and past to present becomes apparent, it likewise knows about future and past, but of the past as something which has taken shape. 
 - HoP 1",209.0
4654,"For the past is the preservation of the present as reality, but the future is the opposite of this, the Becoming of the present as possibility, and thus the formless. 
 - HoP 1",176.0
4655,"From out of this formlessness the universal first comes into form in the present; and hence in the future no form can be perceived. 
 - HoP 1",141.0
4656,"Men have the dim feeling that when God acts it is not in a particular way, nor for particular objects.

4657,"Such things are held to be too paltry to be revealed by God in a particular case. 
 - HoP 1",91.0
4658,"It is acknowledged that God determines the individual, but by this the totality of individuality, or all individualities, is understood; hence it is said that Gods way of working is found in universal nature.

4661,"This his judges could not in justice tolerate, whether they believed it or not. 
 - HoP 1",89.0
4663,"It is so much the more noteworthy, that nevertheless the oracle of the Delphian Apollo, Pythia, declared Socrates to be the wisest Greek. 
 - HoP 1",147.0
4665,"Thus Socrates is the hero who established in the place of the Delphic oracle, the principle that man must look within himself to know what is Truth. 
 - HoP 1",158.0
4666,"Now seeing that Pythia herself pronounced that utterance, we find in it a complete revolution in the Greek mind, and the fact that in place of the oracle, the personal self-consciousness of every thinking man has come into play. 
 - HoP 1",238.0
4667,"This inward certainty, however, is undoubtedly another new god, and not the god of the Athenians existing hitherto, and thus the accusation of Socrates was quite just. 
 - HoP 1",177.0
4668,"If we now consider the second point of the accusation, that Socrates led youth astray, we find that he first sets against it the fact that the oracle of Delphi declared that none could be nobler, juster or wiser than he. 
 - HoP 1",230.0
4669,"And then he sets against this accusation his whole manner of life, and asks whether by the example that he gave, particularly to those with whom he went about, he ever led any into evil. 
 - HoP 1",196.0
4670,"The general accusation had to be further defined and witnesses came forward. 
 - HoP 1",86.0
4672,"Socrates explained himself further on this point when he left the court. 
 - HoP 1",82.0
4673,"For Xenophon tells us  that Anytus was inimical to Socrates, because he said to Anytus, a respected citizen, that he should not bring up his son to the trade of a tanner, but in manner befitting a free man. 
 - HoP 1",216.0
4674,"Anytus was himself a tanner, and although his business was mostly conducted by slaves, it was in itself not ignominious, and Socrates expression was hence wrong, although, as we have seen , quite in the spirit of Greek thought. 
 - HoP 1",237.0
4675,"Socrates added that he had made acquaintance with this son of Anytus and discovered no evil in him, but he prophesied that he would not remain at this servile work to which his father kept him. 
 - HoP 1",203.0
4676,"Nevertheless, because he had no rational person near to look after him, he would come to have evil desires and be brought into dissolute ways.

 - HoP 1",88.0
4682,"He demanded whether it was not matter of astonishment that he should be brought before a judge because he was preferred to parents by the sons in their aspirations after the highest human good which is to be made a noble man. 
 - HoP 1",235.0
4683,"This reply of Socrates is, on the one hand, quite just, but we see at the same time that we cannot call it exhaustive, for the real point of the accusation is not touched. 
 - HoP 1",181.0
4684,"What his judges found unjust was the intrusion morally of a third into the absolute relation between parents and children. 
 - HoP 1",132.0
4686,"Children must have the feeling of unity with their parents; this is the first immediately moral relationship; every teacher must respect it, keep it pure, and cultivate the sense of being thus connected. 
 - HoP 1",213.0
4688,"The worst thing which can happen to children in regard to their morality and their mind, is that the bond which must ever be held in reverence should become loosened or even severed, thereby causing hatred, disdain, and ill-will. 
 - HoP 1",239.0
4689,"Whoever does this, does injury to morality in its truest form. 
 - HoP 1",72.0
4690,"This unity, this confidence, is the mothers milk of morality on which man is nurtured; the early loss of parents is therefore a great misfortune. 
 - HoP 1",155.0
4691,"The son, like the daughter, must indeed come out of his natural unity with the family and become independent, but the separation must be one which is natural or unforced, and not defiant and disdainful.

4692,"When a pain like this has found a place in the heart, great strength of mind is required to overcome it and to heal the wound. 
 - HoP 1",136.0
4693,"If we now speak of the example given us by Socrates, he seems, through his intervention, to have made the young man dissatisfied with his position. 
 - HoP 1",157.0
4694,"Anytus son might, indeed, have found his work generally speaking uncongenial, but it is another thing when such dislike is brought into consciousness and established by the authority of a man such as Socrates. 
 - HoP 1",219.0
4695,"We may very well conjecture that if Socrates had to do with him, he strengthened and developed in him the germ of the feeling of incongruity. 
 - HoP 1",151.0
4697,"Hence this accusation of having destroyed the relationship of parents and children may be regarded as not unfounded, but as perfectly well established. 
 - HoP 1",161.0
4698,"It was also thought very bad in Socrates case particularly, and made a matter of reproach that he had such followers as Critias and Alcibiades, who brought Athens almost to the brink of ruin. 
 - HoP 1",201.0
4699,"For when he mixed himself in the education which others gave their children, men were justified in the demand that the result should not belie what he professed to do for the education of youth. 
 - HoP 1",204.0
4700,"The only question now is, how the people came to take notice of this, and in how far such matters can be objects of legislation and be brought into court. 
 - HoP 1",164.0
4701,"In our law, as regards the first part of the accusation, divination such as Cagliostros is illegal, and it would be forbidden as it formerly was by the Inquisition. 
 - HoP 1",174.0
4703,"But should such questions come before the court? This first of all brings up the question of what is the right of the State, and here great laxity is now allowed. 
 - HoP 1",172.0
4704,"Nevertheless, when some professor or preacher attacks a particular religion, the legislature would certainly take notice of it, and it would have a complete right to do so, although there would be an outcry when it did it. 
 - HoP 1",232.0
4705,"There is undoubtedly a limit which in liberty of thought and speech is difficult to define and rests on tacit agreement; but there is a point beyond which we find what is not allowed, such as direct incitement to insurrection. 
 - HoP 1",236.0
4706,"It is indeed said, that bad principles destroy themselves by themselves and find no entrance. 
 - HoP 1",103.0

 - HoP 1",142.0
4711,"Added to this, it was the case that in Athens quite a different state of things was present than with us; in order to be able to judge rightly of Socrates case we must first consider the Athenian State and its customs.

 - HoP 1",99.0
4718,"Socrates thus attacked and destroyed Athenian life in two fundamental points; the Athenians felt and became conscious of it.

 - HoP 1",105.0
4721,"But all this is false; he was found guilty of these deeds, but not for that reason condemned to death. 
 - HoP 1",112.0
4722,"We here come to the second occurrence in his history. 
 - HoP 1",63.0
4724,"In this penalty the punishment in itself is not brought into question, but only the kind of punishment; the judges had decided that Socrates deserved punishment. 
 - HoP 1",171.0
4725,"But when it was left to the accused to determine what his punishment should be, it might not be arbitrary, but must be in conformity with the crime, a money or bodily punishment. 
 - HoP 1",188.0
4726,"But it was implied in the guilty persons constituting himself his own judge, that he submitted himself to the decision of the court and acknowledged himself to be guilty.

 - HoP 1",166.0
4857,"This principle of the Cyrenaic school would seem to have been far removed from that of Socrates, since we at once think of the transient existence of feeling as directly in opposition to the Good; this, however, is not the case.

4859,"The Cynics also further defined the principle of the Good, but in another way from the Cyrenaics; its content, they said, lay in mans keeping to what is in conformity with nature and to the simple needs of nature.

4860,"They similarly call all that is particular and limited in the aims of men that which is not to be desired.

4868,"But this was only partly true-in that the Eleatic dialecticians maintained Being as the one existence in relation to which nothing particular is a truth, and the Megarics considered Being as the Good.

5174,"The consciousness which has gone beyond itself must, in order to become Mind, now lay hold of and comprehend all reality, ie be conscious of it as its own. 
 - HoP 1",165.0
5176,"The freedom and independence of the Cynics, however, which consists only in lessening to the utmost the burden imposed by wants, is abstract, because it, as negative in character, has really to be a mere renunciation.

5183,"Cynicism adopted a simple wardrobe-a thick stick of wild olive, a ragged double mantle without any under garment, which served as bed by night, a beggars sack for the food that was required, and a cup with which to draw water. 
 - HoP 1",236.0
5184,"This was the costume with which these Cynics used to distinguish themselves. 
 - HoP 1",86.0
5185,"That on which they placed highest value was the simplification of their needs; it seems very plausible to say that this produces freedom. 
 - HoP 1",147.0
5186,"For needs are certainly dependence upon nature, and this is antagonistic to freedom of spirit; the reduction of that dependence to a minimum is thus an idea which commends itself. 
 - HoP 1",189.0
5187,"But at the same time this minimum is itself undetermined, and if such stress is laid on thus merely following nature, it follows that too great a value is set on the needs of nature and on the renunciation of others.

5247,"We must begin by mentioning the facts of Platos life. 
 - HoP 2",63.0
5248,"Plato was an Athenian, born in the third year of the 87th Olympiad, or, according to Dodwell, Ol. 
 - HoP 2",107.0
5249,"He was, according to this, thirty-nine or forty years younger than Socrates. 
 - HoP 2",86.0
5250,"His father, Ariston, traced his lineage from Cadrus; his mother, Perictione, was descended from Solon. 
 - HoP 2",112.0
5252,"Critias is usually represented by the ancients as an atheist, with the Cyrenaic Theodoras and Diagoras of Melos; Sextus Empiricus  has preserved to us a fine fragment from one of his poems. 
 - HoP 2",199.0
5253,"Sprung from this noble race, and with no lack of means for his culture, Plato received from the most highly esteemed of the Sophists an education in all the arts which were then thought to befit an Athenian. 
 - HoP 2",217.0
5254,"In his family he was called Aristocles; it was only later that he received from his teacher the name of Plato. 
 - HoP 2",120.0
5255,"Some say that he was so styled because of the breadth of his forehead; others, because of the richness and breadth of his discourse; others again, because of his well-built form. 
 - HoP 2",188.0
5256,"In his youth he cultivated poetry, and wrote tragedies-very much like young poets in our day-also dithyrambs and songs. 
 - HoP 2",129.0
5258,"In his youth he had every intention of devoting himself to politics. 
 - HoP 2",78.0
5259,"He was brought by his father to Socrates when in his twentieth year, and enjoyed intimate friendship with him for eight years. 
 - HoP 2",136.0

 - HoP 2",207.0
5262,"Plato did not content himself with the society and wisdom of Socrates, but studied in addition the older philosophers, particularly Heraclitus. 
 - HoP 2",153.0
5263,"Aristotle  states that Plato, before he ever came to Socrates, associated with Cratylus, and had been initiated into the doctrines of Heraclitus. 
 - HoP 2",155.0
5264,"He also studied the Eleatics, and very particularly the Pythagoreans, and he frequented the society of the most noted Sophists.

 - HoP 2",149.0

 - HoP 2",217.0
5293,"Dionysius could not, however, induce Plato to come under any obligation to him; he desired that Plato should give himself up to him entirely, but this was a demand that Plato refused to entertain.

 - HoP 2",47.0
5295,"After the separation, however, both felt the desire to be again together.

5300,"His interest in Philosophy was just as superficial as his repeated attempts in poetry; and while he wished to be everything-poet, philosopher, and statesman-he would not submit to be under the guidance of others. 
 - HoP 2",222.0
5301,"Thus no closer tie between Plato and Dionysius was formed; they drew together again, and again parted, so that the third visit to Sicily ended also in coldness, and the connection was not again established. 
 - HoP 2",216.0
5303,"The Pythagoreans of Tarentum came at length to the rescue,6 demanded Plato back from Dionysius, got him conveyed away safely, and brought him to Greece.

5304,"They were aided by the circumstance that Dionysius was afraid of an ill report being spread that he was not on good terms with Plato.

 - HoP 2",95.0
5446,"As to this demand, it may seem a piece of great presumption to say that philosophers should have the government of states accorded to them, for the territory or ground of history is different from that of Philosophy.

5805,"In this respect, perhaps, the result arrived at in the Parmenides may not satisfy us, since it seems to be negative in character, and not, as the negation of the negation, expressive of true affirmation. 
 - HoP 2",213.0
5806,"Nevertheless, the Neo-platonists, and more especially Proclus, regard the result arrived at in the Parmenides as the true theology, as the true revelation of all the mysteries of the divine essence. 
 - HoP 2",208.0
5807,"And it cannot be regarded as anything else, however little this may at first appear, and though Tiedemann  speaks of these assertions as merely the wild extravagances of the Neo-platonists. 
 - HoP 2",199.0
5810,"But here there appears the double interpretation already remarked upon , which has now to be more clearly expounded. 
 - HoP 2",126.0
5811,"It is that God and the essential reality of things may be understood in two different ways. 
 - HoP 2",101.0
5815,"On the other hand, they may also be taken to be pure Notions, which pertain purely to reflection into itself. 
 - HoP 2",119.0
5817,"For the solution of this contradiction we must know the nature of apprehension and knowledge, in order to obtain in the Notion everything there present. 
 - HoP 2",162.0
5819,"Plato did not state this knowledge of the nature of the Notion so expressly, nor did he say that this essential Being of things is the same as the divine essence. 
 - HoP 2",172.0
5820,"But really it is simply not put into words, for the fact is undoubtedly present, and the only distinction is one of speech as between the mode of the ordinary conception and that of the Notion. 
 - HoP 2",203.0
5823,"In the Sophist Plato investigated the pure Notions or Ideas of movement and rest, self-identity and other-being, Being and non-being. 
 - HoP 2",143.0
5824,"He here proves, as against Parmenides, that non-being is, and likewise that the simple self-identical partakes of other-being, and unity of multiplicity. 
 - HoP 2",163.0
5825,"He says of the Sophists that they never get beyond non-being, and he also refutes their whole ground-principle, which is non-being, feeling, and the many. 
 - HoP 2",164.0
5827,"Plato tried, however, to preserve the difference likewise. 
 - HoP 2",68.0
5828,"The Sophist is a further development of Being and non-being, both of which are applicable to all things; for because things are different, the one being the other of the other, the determination of the negative is present. 
 - HoP 2",232.0
5830,"Plato thus first refutes what is sensuous, and then even the Ideas themselves. 
 - HoP 2",88.0
5832,"Let us,  says Plato, in the second place, proceed to the other, to the friends of Ideas. 
 - HoP 2",98.0
5833,"Their belief is that the substantial is incorporeal, intellectual, and they separate from it the region of Becoming, of change, into which the sensuous falls, while the universal is for itself. 
 - HoP 2",203.0
5834,"These represent Ideas as immovable, and neither active nor passive. 
 - HoP 2",77.0
5835,"Plato asserts, as against this, that movement, life, soul, and thought, cannot be denied to true Being , and that the holy reason  can be nowhere, and in nothing that is unmoved. 
 - HoP 2",188.0
5836,"Plato thus has a clear consciousness of having got further than Parmenides when he says:-    Keep your mind from this way of inquiry,   For never will you show that non-being is. 
 - HoP 2",188.0
5837,"Plato says that Being in anyone partakes both of Being and non-being; but what thus participates is different both from Being and non-being as such. 
 - HoP 2",158.0
5838,"This dialectic combats two things in particular; and in the first place it is antagonistic to the common dialectic in the ordinary sense, of which we have already spoken. 
 - HoP 2",180.0
5840,"For example, Plato expressed his dissent when Protagoras and others said that no determination is absolutely certain-that bitter is not objective, for what to one person is bitter, to another is sweet. 
 - HoP 2",211.0
5841,"Similarly, large and small, more and less, &c, are relative, because the large will be, in other circumstances, small, and the small will be great. 
 - HoP 2",157.0
5843,"As in each thing we demonstrate unity, so do we also show its multiplicity, for it has many parts and qualities. 
 - HoP 2",122.0
5844,"In the Parmenides, Plato, as we saw above , objected to this unity of opposites, because it must thereby be said that something is one in quite another respect from that in which it is many. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
5847,"The dialectic that annuls a determination because it reveals in it some defect, and then goes on to establish another, is thus wrong. 
 - HoP 2",143.0
5850,"To separate all existences from one another is the crude attempt of an uncultured and unphilosophical mind. 
 - HoP 2",117.0
5851,"To cause everything to fall asunder means the perfect annihilation of all thought, for thought is the union of ideas. 
 - HoP 2",127.0
5852,"Thus Plato expressly speaks against the dialectic of showing how anything may be refuted from some point of view or another. 
 - HoP 2",134.0
5853,"We see that Plato, in respect of content, expresses nothing excepting what is called indifference in difference, the difference of absolute opposites and their unity. 
 - HoP 2",176.0
5855,"The second point against which Plato argues is the dialectic of the Eleatics, and their assertion, which in its nature resembles that of the Sophists, that only Being is, and non-being is not. 
 - HoP 2",202.0
5857,"Plato reproaches the Sophists for thus doing away with the difference between true and false. 
 - HoP 2",103.0
5858,"Having arrived at this stage in the knowledge of the dialectic  the Sophists could allow what they promise-that everything that the individual, according to his belief, makes his end and interest, is affirmative and right. 
 - HoP 2",232.0
5859,"Hence it cannot be said that such and such an act is wrong, wicked, a crime; for this would be to say that the maxim of the action is wrong. 
 - HoP 2",150.0
5861,"The proposition in itself seems quite abstract and innocent, but we first notice what is involved in such abstractions when we see them in concrete form. 
 - HoP 2",163.0
5862,"According to this innocent proposition there would be no wickedness and no crime. 
 - HoP 2",91.0
5863,"The Platonic dialectic is essentially different from this kind of dialectic. 
 - HoP 2",86.0
5864,"What is further present to the mind of Plato is that the Idea, the absolute universal, good, true, and beautiful, is to be taken for itself. 
 - HoP 2",150.0
5865,"The myth, which I have already quoted , indeed goes to prove that we must not consider a good action, a noble man-not the subject of which these determinations are predicated. 
 - HoP 2",185.0
5866,"For that which appears in such conceptions or perceptions as predicate, must be taken for itself, and this is the absolute truth. 
 - HoP 2",139.0
5867,"This tallies with the nature of the dialectic which has been described. 
 - HoP 2",81.0
5868,"An action, taken in accordance with the empirical conception, may be called right; in another aspect, quite opposite determinations may be shown to be in it. 
 - HoP 2",167.0
5869,"But the good and true must be taken on their own account without such individualities, without this empirical and concrete character; and the good and true thus taken alone, constitute that which is. 
 - HoP 2",209.0
5870,"The soul which, according to the divine drama, is found in matter, rejoices in a beautiful and just object; but the only actual truth is in absolute virtue, justice, and beauty. 
 - HoP 2",187.0
5871,"It is thus the universal for itself which is further determined in the Platonic dialectic; of this several forms appear, but these forms are themselves still very general and abstract. 
 - HoP 2",194.0
5872,"Platos highest form is the identity of Being and non-being. 
 - HoP 2",69.0
5873,"The true is that which is, but this Being is not without negation. 
 - HoP 2",76.0
5874,"Platos object is thus to show that non-being is an essential determination in Being, and that the simple, self-identical, partakes of other-being. 
 - HoP 2",156.0
5875,"This unity of Being and non-being is also found in the Sophists; but this alone is not the end of the matter. 
 - HoP 2",119.0
5878,"Plato thus maintains that the other, as the negative, non-identical, is likewise in one and the same respect the self-identical; there are not different sides which are in mutual opposition. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
5879,"These are the principal points in Platos peculiar dialectic. 
 - HoP 2",70.0
5880,"The fact that the Idea of the divine, eternal, beautiful, is absolute existence, is the beginning of the elevation of consciousness into the spiritual, and into the consciousness that the universal is true. 
 - HoP 2",216.0
5881,"It may be enough for the ordinary idea to be animated and satisfied by the conception of the beautiful and good, but thinking knowledge demands the determination of this eternal and divine. 
 - HoP 2",199.0
5882,"And this determination is really only free determination which certainly does not prevent universality-a limitation  which likewise leaves the universal in its infinitude free and independent. 
 - HoP 2",202.0
5883,"Freedom exists only in a return into itself; the undistinguished is the lifeless; the active, living, concrete universal is hence what inwardly distinguishes itself, but yet remains free in so doing. 
 - HoP 2",209.0
5884,"Now this determinateness consists in the one being identical with itself in the other, in the many, in what is distinguished. 
 - HoP 2",135.0
5885,"This constitutes the only truth, and the only interest for knowledge in what is called Platonic philosophy, and if this is not known, the main point of it is not known. 
 - HoP 2",178.0
5888,"But the esoteric is the speculative, which, even though written and printed, is yet, without being any secret, hidden from those who have not sufficient interest in it to exert themselves. 
 - HoP 2",198.0
5889,"To this esoteric portion pertain the two dialogues hitherto considered, along with which the Philebus may in the third place be taken. 
 - HoP 2",144.0
5890,"In the Philebus Plato investigates the nature of pleasure; and the opposition of the infinite and finite, or of the unlimited  and limiting , is there more especially dealt with. 
 - HoP 2",188.0
5892,"When Plato treats of pleasure and wisdom as contrasted, it is the opposition of finite and infinite. 
 - HoP 2",110.0
5893,"By pleasure we certainly represent to ourselves the immediately individual, the sensuous; but pleasure is the indeterminate in respect that it is the merely elementary, like fire and water, and not the self-determining. 
 - HoP 2",229.0
5894,"Only the Idea is the self-determinate, or self-identity. 
 - HoP 2",66.0
5895,"To our reflection the infinite appears to be what is best and highest, limitation being inferior to it; and ancient philosophers so determined it. 
 - HoP 2",156.0
5897,"The infinite is the formless; free form as activity is the finite, which finds in the infinite the material for self-realization. 
 - HoP 2",139.0
5898,"Plato thus characterizes enjoyment dependent on the senses as the unlimited which does not determine itself; reason alone is the active determination. 
 - HoP 2",160.0
5899,"But the infinite is what in itself passes over to the finite; thus the perfect good, according to Plato, is neither to be sought for in happiness or reason, but in a life of both combined. 
 - HoP 2",198.0
5900,"But wisdom, as limit, is the true cause from which what is excellent arises. 
 - HoP 2",86.0
5901,"As that which posits measure and end, it is what absolutely determines the end-the immanent determination with which and in which freedom likewise brings itself into existence. 
 - HoP 2",186.0
5902,"Plato further considers the fact that the true is the identity of opposites, thus. 
 - HoP 2",92.0
5903,"The infinite, as the indeterminate, is capable of a more or less, it may be more intensive or not; thus colder and warmer, drier and moister, quicker and slower, &c, are all such. 
 - HoP 2",189.0
5904,"What is limited is the equal, the double, and every other measure; by this means the opposite ceases to be unlike and becomes uniform and harmonious. 
 - HoP 2",159.0
5906,"Health, happiness, beauty, &c, would thus appear to be begotten, in as far as the opposites are allied thereto, but they are likewise an intermingling of the same. 
 - HoP 2",173.0
5907,"The ancients make copious use of intermingling, participation, &c, instead of individuality; but for us these are indefinite and inadequate expressions. 
 - HoP 2",162.0
5908,"But Plato says that the third, which is thus begotten, pre-supposes the cause or that from which it is formed; this is more excellent than those through whose instrumentality that third arose. 
 - HoP 2",202.0
5909,"Hence Plato has four determinations; first the unlimited, the undetermined; secondly the limited, measure, proportion, to which pertains wisdom; the third is what is mingled from both, what has only arisen; the fourth is cause. 
 - HoP 2",237.0
5911,"Weak corporeality passes away as soon as another comes into it. 
 - HoP 2",73.0
5912,"The cause he speaks of is divine reason, which governs the world; the beauty of the world which is present in air, fire, water, and in all that lives, is produced thereby. 
 - HoP 2",181.0
5913,"Thus the absolute is what in one unity is finite and infinite. 
 - HoP 2",72.0
5914,"When Plato speaks thus of the beautiful and good, these are concrete ideas, or rather there is only one idea. 
 - HoP 2",119.0
5915,"But we are still far from these concrete ideas when we begin with such abstractions as Being, non-being, unity, and multiplicity. 
 - HoP 2",139.0
5917,"This transition to the concrete is made in the Philebus, since the principle of feeling and of pleasure is there considered. 
 - HoP 2",134.0
5918,"The ancient philosophers knew very well what they had of concrete in those abstract thoughts. 
 - HoP 2",103.0
5919,"In the atomic principle of multiplicity we thus find the source of a construction of the state, for the ultimate thought-determination of such state-principles is the logical. 
 - HoP 2",185.0
5920,"The ancients in their pure Philosophy had not the same end in view as we-they had not the end of a metaphysical sequence placed before them like a problem. 
 - HoP 2",165.0
5921,"We, on the other hand, have something concrete before us, and desire to reduce it to settled order. 
 - HoP 2",109.0
5923,"This contemplative life seems aimless, for the reason that all its interests have disappeared. 
 - HoP 2",104.0
5924,"But to live in freedom in the kingdom of thought had become the absolute end to the ancients, and they knew that freedom existed only in thought. 
 - HoP 2",155.0
5925,"With Plato Philosophy likewise commenced to devote more attention to the understanding of what is further determined, and in this way the matter of knowledge began to fall into divisions. 
 - HoP 2",197.0
5928,"Plato derived a great deal from the Pythagoreans; how much is theirs, however, cannot be satisfactorily determined. 
 - HoP 2",125.0
5930,"The TimÃ¦us has in all times been esteemed the most difficult and obscure of the Platonic dialogues. 
 - HoP 2",110.0
5932,"The second difficulty lies in the arrangement of the whole, for what at once strikes one is that Plato repeatedly breaks off the thread of his argument, often appearing to turn back and begin again from the beginning. 
 - HoP 2",227.0
5934,"Wolff accordingly thought it was evident from this that the dialogue, like Homers poems, had been, in its first form, spoken and not written. 
 - HoP 2",151.0
5937,"God here is still without determination, and a name which has no meaning for thought; nevertheless, where Plato in the TimÃ¦us again begins from the beginning, he is found to have a more definite idea of God. 
 - HoP 2",218.0
5938,"That God is devoid of envy undoubtedly is a great, beautiful, true, and childlike thought. 
 - HoP 2",100.0
5939,"With the ancients, on the contrary, we find in Nemesis, Dike, Fate, Jealousy, the one determination of the gods: moved by this they cast down the great and bring it low, and suffer not what is excellent and elevated to exist. 
 - HoP 2",235.0
5940,"The later high-minded philosophers controverted this doctrine. 
 - HoP 2",72.0
5942,"Platos thought is thus much higher than that of most of our moderns, who, in saying that God is a hidden God who has not revealed Himself to us and of whom we can know nothing, ascribe jealousy to God. 
 - HoP 2",211.0
5944,"If the knowledge of God were kept from us in order that we should know only the finite and not attain to the infinite, God would be a jealous God, or God would then become an empty name. 
 - HoP 2",196.0
5945,"Such talk means no more than that we wish to neglect what is higher and divine, and seek after our own petty interests and opinions. 
 - HoP 2",142.0
5946,"This humility is sin-the sin against the Holy Ghost. 
 - HoP 2",62.0
5949,"These are not the philosophic doctrines which Plato seriously held, for he speaks here only after the manner of the ordinary conception, and such expressions have hence no philosophic content. 
 - HoP 2",202.0
5950,"It is only the introduction of the subject, bringing us, as it does, to determinations such as matter. 
 - HoP 2",112.0
5951,"Plato then comes in course of his progress to further determinations, and in these we first have the Notion; we must hold to what is speculative in Plato, and not to the first-mentioned ordinary conception. 
 - HoP 2",216.0
5952,"Likewise, when he says that God esteemed order to be the best, the mode of expression is naÃ¯ve. 
 - HoP 2",106.0
5953,"Nowadays we should ask that God should first be proved; and just as little should we allow the visible to be established without much further ado. 
 - HoP 2",156.0
5954,"What is proved by Plato from this more naÃ¯ve method of expression is, in the first place, the true determination of the Idea, which only appears later on. 
 - HoP 2",165.0
5957,"There is, however, only one such animal, for were there two or more, these would be only parts of the one, and only one.

5959,"In this childlike way Plato introduces these extremes, solidity and life. 
 - HoP 2",83.0
5960,"But two things cannot be united without a third, there must be a bond between them, uniting both -one of Platos simple methods of expression. 
 - HoP 2",151.0
5961,"The fairest bond, however, is that which most completely fuses itself and that which is bound by it. 
 - HoP 2",110.0
5962,"That is a profound saying, in which the Notion is contained; the bond is the subjective and individual, the power which dominates the other, which makes itself identical with it.

5964,"This is excellent, we have still preserved this in our Philosophy; it is the distinction which is no distinction. 
 - HoP 2",123.0
5965,"This diremption from which Plato proceeds, is the conclusion which we know from logic; it appears in the form of the ordinary syllogism, in which, however, the whole rationality of the Idea is, at least externally, contained. 
 - HoP 2",235.0
5967,"It is hence a mistake to disparage the conclusion and not to recognize it as the highest and absolute form; in respect of the conclusions arrived at by the understanding, on the contrary, we should be right in rejecting it. 
 - HoP 2",233.0
5968,"This last has no such mean; each of the differences is there recognized as different in its own independent form, as having a character different from that of the other. 
 - HoP 2",179.0
5974,"In the Platonic philosophy we thus have what is best and highest; the thoughts are, indeed, merely pure thoughts, but they contain everything in themselves; for all concrete forms depend on thought-determinations alone.

 - HoP 2",211.0
6116,"The only point of interest for us then in Platos philosophy of mind is his view of mans moral nature; and this real, practical side of consciousness is Platos greatest glory, and hence must now be specially dealt with by us. 
 - HoP 2",234.0
6118,"Neither did he trouble himself about a natural right, which is but a trivial abstraction foisted on to the real practical existence, the right; but it is of mans moral nature that he treats in the Republic. 
 - HoP 2",216.0
6120,"We must further remark that in the Republic Plato introduces the investigation of his subject with the object of showing what justice  is. 
 - HoP 2",148.0
6122,"The same plan should be followed now with justice. 
 - HoP 2",60.0
6123,"Justice is not only in the individual, but also in the state, and the state is greater than the individual; justice is therefore imprinted on states in larger characters, and is more easily recognizable. 
 - HoP 2",213.0
6124,"It is therefore preferable to consider justice as it is to be found in the state. 
 - HoP 2",91.0
6125,"By making this comparison Plato transforms the question anent justice into an investigation of the state; it is a very simple and graceful transition, though it seems arbitrary. 
 - HoP 2",187.0
6126,"It was great force of insight that really led the ancients to the truth; and what Plato brings forward as merely simplifying the difficulty, may, in fact, be said to exist in the nature of the thing. 
 - HoP 2",209.0
6127,"For it is not convenience which leads him to this position, but the fact that justice can be carried out only in so far as man is a member of a state, for in the state alone is justice present in reality and truth. 
 - HoP 2",224.0
6129,"But the principle of the state again is the objective reality of justice, the reality in which the whole mind is present and not only the knowledge of myself as this individual. 
 - HoP 2",187.0
6130,"For as the free and reasonable will determines itself, there are laws of freedom; but these laws are nothing else than state-laws, for the Notion of the state implies the existence of a reasoning will. 
 - HoP 2",211.0
6132,"Thus Plato, in order to discern the features of justice, with the instinct of reason fixes his attention on their manner of representation in the state. 
 - HoP 2",162.0
6133,"Justice in itself is ordinarily represented by us in the form of a natural right, right in a condition of nature; such a condition of nature is, however, a direct moral impossibility. 
 - HoP 2",193.0
6134,"That which is in itself is, by those who do not attain to the universal, held to be something natural, as the necessary moments of the mind are held to be innate ideas.

6146,"As to this, the first remark to be made is that in the Christian world in general there passes current an ideal of a perfect man which certainly cannot be carried out in the great body of a nation.

6162,"The true ideal is not what ought to be real, but what is real, and the only real; if an ideal is held to be too good to exist, there must be some fault in the ideal itself, for which reality is too good. 
 - HoP 2",213.0
6163,"The Platonic Republic would thus be a chimera, not because excellence such as it depicts is lacking to mankind, but because it, this excellence, falls short of mans requirements.

6164,"For what is real, is rational.

6205,"I will now indicate more fully the main features, in so far as they possess philosophic interest. 
 - HoP 2",107.0
6209,"Through the development of these moments it becomes living and existing, but these moments are not independent, for they are held in unity. 
 - HoP 2",149.0
6211,"Plato does not preach the morality of reflection, he shows how traditional morality has a living movement in itself; he demonstrates its functions, its inward organism. 
 - HoP 2",178.0
6212,"For it is inner systematization, as in organic life, and not solid, dead unity, like that of metals, which comes to pass by means of the different functions of the organs which go to make up this living, self-moving unity. 
 - HoP 2",232.0
6213,"Without classes, without this division into great masses, the state has no organism; these great distinctions are the distinction of the substantial. 
 - HoP 2",159.0
6217,"He accordingly represents three classes,  that of the governors, men of learning and wisdom,  that of the warriors,  that of the producers of necessaries, the husbandmen and handicraftsmen. 
 - HoP 2",199.0
6219,"Although Plato does not deduce this division of the classes, they follow from the constitution of the Platonic state, and every state is necessarily a system within itself of these systems. 
 - HoP 2",199.0
6221,"Then Plato points out that the moments which are here realized in the classes, are moral qualities which are present in individuals, and form their true essence, the simple ethical Notion divided into its universal determinations. 
 - HoP 2",240.0
6222,"For he states as the result of this distinction of the classes that through such an organism all virtues are present in the commonwealth; he distinguishes four of these,64 and they have been named cardinal virtues. 
 - HoP 2",224.0
6225,"This faculty of perception is properly the peculiar possession of the smallest class. 
 - HoP 2",95.0
6226,"The second virtue is courage  which Plato defines as a firm opinion about what may justly and lawfully be considered an object of fear, courage which, in its strength of purpose, remains unshaken either by desires or pleasures. 
 - HoP 2",237.0
6227,"To this virtue corresponds the class of the warriors. 
 - HoP 2",63.0
6229,"This virtue therefore is not, like wisdom and courage, confined to one part of the state, but like a harmony it is shared by governors and governed alike, and is the virtue of all classes. 
 - HoP 2",198.0
6231,"But this virtue is present precisely when no moment, no determination or particularity isolates itself; or, more closely viewed in a moral aspect, it is when no want asserts its reality and thus becomes a crime. 
 - HoP 2",221.0
6232,"Now work is just this moment of activity concentrating itself on the particular, which nevertheless goes back into the universal, and is for it. 
 - HoP 2",154.0
6234,"Finally, the fourth virtue is justice, which was what Plato began by considering. 
 - HoP 2",91.0
6236,"The first remark we make on this is, that Plato here places justice on a level with the other moments, and it thus appears as one of the four determinations. 
 - HoP 2",167.0
6237,"But he now retracts this statement and makes it justice which first gives to wisdom, courage and temperance the power to exist at all, and when they have once come into existence, the power to continue. 
 - HoP 2",212.0
6238,"This is the reason of his also saying that justice will be met with independently, if only the other virtues spoken of are forthcoming. 
 - HoP 2",145.0
6239,"To express it more definitely, the Notion of justice is the foundation, the Idea of the whole, which falls into organic divisions, so that every part is only, as it were, a moment in the whole, and the whole exists through it. 
 - HoP 2",236.0
6240,"Thus the classes or qualities spoken of are nothing else than the moments of this whole. 
 - HoP 2",98.0
6241,"Justice is only the general and all-pervading quality; but at the same time it implies the independence of every part, to which the state gives liberty of action. 
 - HoP 2",172.0
6243,"In a highly abstract sense my personality, my altogether abstract freedom, is present in property. 
 - HoP 2",108.0
6244,"To explain what comes under this science of law, Plato considers on the whole superfluous. 
 - HoP 2",100.0
6245,"To be sure we find him giving laws concerning property, police regulations, &c, But,  he says, to impose laws about such matters on men of noble character does not repay the trouble. 
 - HoP 2",192.0
6246,"In truth, how can we expect to find divine laws in what contains contingencies alone? Even in the Laws he considers ethics chiefly, though he gives a certain amount of attention to the rights of property. 
 - HoP 2",214.0
6251,"The particular subject, as subject, has in the same way these qualities in himself; and these moments of the subject correspond with the three real moments of the state. 
 - HoP 2",179.0
6252,"That there is thus one rhythm, one type, in the Idea of the state, forms for Platos state a great and grand basis. 
 - HoP 2",124.0
6253,"This third form, in which the above moments are exhibited, Plato characterizes in the following manner. 
 - HoP 2",113.0
6254,"There manifest themselves in the subject, first of all sundry wants and desires , like hunger and thirst, each of which has something definite as its one and only object. 
 - HoP 2",180.0
6255,"Work for the satisfaction of desires corresponds to the calling of the third class. 
 - HoP 2",93.0
6257,"To this corresponds the class of rulers, the wisdom of the state. 
 - HoP 2",75.0
6258,"Besides these two ideas of the soul there is a third, anger , which on one side is allied to the desires, but of which it is just as true that it resists the desires and takes the side of reason. 
 - HoP 2",205.0
6259,"It may happen that a man has done wrong to another, and suffers hunger and cold at the hands of him whom he considers entitled to inflict them upon him; in this case, the nobler he is, the less will his anger be excited. 
 - HoP 2",230.0
6261,"Anger corresponds with the class of the brave defenders in the state; as these grasp their weapons in behalf of reason within the state, so does anger take the part of reason, if it has not been perverted by an evil up-bringing. 
 - HoP 2",238.0
6262,"Therefore wisdom in the state is the same as in the individual, and this is true of courage also. 
 - HoP 2",107.0

6270,"Plato would produce this ethical quality directly in the individuals, and first and foremost in the guardians, whose education is therefore the most important part of the whole, and constitutes the very foundation.

6273,"The education of the presidents should, however, be carried on chiefly by means of philosophic science, which is the knowledge of the universal and absolute.

 - HoP 2",157.0
6283,"Morals cannot be independent of institutions, that is, institutions cannot be brought to bear on morals through educational establishments or religion only.

6287,"For if reason is the universal force, it is essentially spiritual; thus to the realm of the spiritual belongs subjective freedom, which had already been held up as a principle in the philosophy of Socrates. 
 - HoP 2",216.0
6288,"Therefore reason ought to be the basis of law, and so it is, on the whole. 
 - HoP 2",84.0
6289,"But, on the other hand, conscience, personal conviction,-in short, all the forms of subjective freedom-are essentially therein contained. 
 - HoP 2",147.0
6291,"Individual conscience proceeds from the subjectivity of free-will, connects itself with the whole, chooses a position for itself, and thus makes itself a moral fact. 
 - HoP 2",175.0
6293,"In passing beyond the principle of Greek morality, which in its substantial liberty cannot brook the rise of subjective liberty, the Platonic philosophy at once grasps the above principle, and in so doing proceeds still farther. 
 - HoP 2",238.0
6295,"It specially harmonizes with this particular quality of excluding the principle of subjectivity, that Plato in the first place does not allow individuals to choose their own class; this we demand as necessary to freedom.

6297,"According as anyone has natural ability and talents, these elders make choice and selection, and assign each man to a definite occupation.

6301,"From this determination it further follows that Plato  in like manner altogether abolished in his state the principle of private property. 
 - HoP 2",148.0
6302,"For in it individuality, the individual consciousness, becomes absolute; or the person is looked on as implicit, destitute of all content.

6303,"In law, as such, I rank as this  implicitly and explicitly. 
 - HoP 2",69.0
6304,"All rank thus, and I rank only because all rank, or I rank only as universal; but the content of this universality is fixed particularity.

6306,"But Being to Philosophy is no abstraction, but the unity of the universal and reality, or its content. 
 - HoP 2",112.0

6308,"In so far as I use things,-not in so far as I have them merely in my possession, or as they have worth for me as existent, as definitely fixed on me,-they stand in living relation to me. 
 - HoP 2",196.0
6310,"Personal property is a possession which belongs to me as a certain person, and in which my person as such comes into existence, into reality; on this ground Plato excludes it.

6313,"In this way we see subjective freedom consciously removed by Plato himself from his state. 
 - HoP 2",100.0
6314,"For the same reason Plato also abolishes marriage, because it is a connection in which persons of opposite sex, as such, remain mutually bound to one another, even beyond the mere natural connection.

 - HoP 2",109.0
6323,"And Plato accordingly allows the women to take their part like the men in all manly labours, and even to share in the toils of war. 
 - HoP 2",141.0
6326,"Therein, however, lies the very limit of the Platonic Idea-to emerge only as abstract idea. 
 - HoP 2",101.0
6327,"But, in fact, the true Idea is nothing else than this, that every moment should perfectly realize and embody itself, and make itself independent, while at the same time, in its independence, it is for mind a thing sublated. 
 - HoP 2",233.0
6328,"In conformity with this Idea, individuality must fully realize itself, must have its sphere and domain in the state, and yet be resolved in it.

6331,"The state in general, the whole, must finally pervade all. 
 - HoP 2",68.0
6332,"But in exactly the same way the formal principle of justice, as abstract universality of personality with individual Being as its existent content, must pervade the whole; one class, nevertheless, specially belongs to it.

6335,"This principle must have its full and complete reality, it must indeed appear in the shape of property. 
 - HoP 2",113.0

6337,"Nature cannot effect this production of independent life in her parts, except in the great system.

6339,"The want of subjectivity is really the want of the Greek moral idea. 
 - HoP 2",78.0
6340,"The principle which became prominent with Socrates had been present up to this time only in a more subordinate capacity; now it of necessity became an even absolute principle, a necessary moment in the Idea itself.

6345,"In this the principle is carried to the very opposite extreme, and has emerged in its utter one-sidedness. 
 - HoP 2",116.0
6347,"Men must have brought forth from themselves the rational along with their interests and their passions, just as it must enter into reality through the necessities, opportunities, and motives that impel them. 
 - HoP 2",217.0
6348,"There is still another celebrated side of the Platonic philosophy which may be considered, namely Ã¦sthetics, the knowledge of the beautiful. 
 - HoP 2",151.0
6349,"In respect to this, Plato has in like manner seized the one true thought, that the essence of the beautiful is intellectual, the Idea of reason. 
 - HoP 2",154.0
6351,"The case is the same here as it is with his Idea. 
 - HoP 2",59.0
6352,"As the essence and truth of phenomena in general is the Idea, the truth of phenomenal beauty must also be this Idea. 
 - HoP 2",126.0
6353,"The relation to the corporeal, as a relation of the desires, or of pleasure and utility, is no relation to it as the beautiful; it is a relation to it as the sensuous alone, or a relation of particular to particular. 
 - HoP 2",226.0
6354,"But the essence of the beautiful is just the simple Idea of reason present to the sensuous apprehension as a thing; the content of the thing is nothing else than this. 
 - HoP 2",177.0
6355,"The beautiful is essentially of spiritual nature; it is thus not merely a sensuous thing, but reality subject to the form of universality, to the truth. 
 - HoP 2",162.0
6356,"This universal does not, however, retain the form of universality, but the universal is the content whose form is the sensuous mode; and therein lies the determination of the beautiful. 
 - HoP 2",195.0
6357,"In science, the universal has again the form of the universal or of the Notion; but the beautiful appears as an actual thing-or, when put into words, as a popular conception, in which mode the material exists in mind. 
 - HoP 2",227.0
6358,"The nature, essence, and content of the beautiful is recognized and judged by reason alone, as its content is the same as that of Philosophy. 
 - HoP 2",151.0
6359,"But because reason appears in the beautiful in material guise, the beautiful ranks below knowledge, and Plato has for this very reason placed the true manifestation of reason in knowledge, where it is spiritually manifested. 
 - HoP 2",234.0
6360,"This may be regarded as the kernel of Platos philosophy. 
 - HoP 2",66.0
6362,"Platos philosophy had two stages through which it of necessity developed and worked its way up to a higher principle.

6365,"Both of these we shall consider later. 
 - HoP 2",48.0
6366,"Here we leave Plato, and we do so with regret. 
 - HoP 2",56.0
6368,"Because we still possess so large a number of his works, the extent of the material at hand is proportionately greater; unfortunately, however, I cannot give to Aristotle the amount of attention that he deserves. 
 - HoP 2",222.0
6369,"For we shall have to confine ourselves to a general view of his philosophy, and simply remark on one particular phase of it, viz. 
 - HoP 2",139.0
6371,"For most of the philosophic sciences have to render thanks to him both for their characterization and first commencement. 
 - HoP 2",131.0
6372,"But although in this way Science throughout falls into a succession of intellectual determinations of determinate Notions, the Aristotelian philosophy still contains the profoundest speculative Notions.

6373,"Aristotle proceeds in reference to the whole in the same way as in the individual case. 
 - HoP 2",97.0
6375,"We need not try to demonstrate necessity from the standpoint of the philosophy of that time. 
 - HoP 2",102.0
6376,"But although Aristotles system does not appear to be developed in its parts from the Notion, and its parts are merely ranged side by side, they still form a totality of truly speculative philosophy. 
 - HoP 2",208.0
6378,"For to him views are ascribed diametrically opposite to his philosophy. 
 - HoP 2",81.0
6379,"And while Plato is much read, the treasures contained in Aristotle have for centuries, and until quite modern times, been as good as unknown, and the falsest prejudices reign respecting him. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
6380,"Almost no one knows his speculative and logical works; in modern times more justice has been done to his writings regarding nature, but not to his philosophic views. 
 - HoP 2",175.0
6381,"For instance, there is a quite generally held opinion that the Aristotelian and Platonic philosophies are directly opposed, the one being idealistic and the other realistic, and that, indeed, in the most trivial sense.

6383,"But we shall see how little this really is the case.

 - HoP 2",223.0
6507,"But Aristotle, because he looks at all sides of the universe, takes up all those units as a speculative philosopher, and so works upon them that the profoundest speculative Notion proceeds therefrom.

 - HoP 2",61.0
6513,"But, on the one hand, this mode presents a complete series of the moments, and on the other, it arouses personal investigation for the discovery of necessity. 
 - HoP 2",168.0
6516,"But Aristotle has the patience to go through all conceptions and questions, and from the investigation of the individual determinations, we have the fixed, and once more restored determination of every object. 
 - HoP 2",219.0
6517,"Aristotle thus forms the Notion, and is in the highest degree really philosophic, while he appears to be only empiric. 
 - HoP 2",128.0
6518,"For Aristotles empiricism is a totality because he always leads it back again immediately to speculation; he may thus be said to be a perfect empiricist, yet at the same time a thinking one. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
6519,"If, for example, we take away from space all its empirical determinations, the result will be in the highest degree speculative, for the empirical, comprehended in its synthesis, is the speculative Notion. 
 - HoP 2",215.0
6520,"In this gathering up of determinations into one Notion, Aristotle is great and masterly, as he also is in regard to the simplicity of his method of progression, and in the giving of his decisions in few words. 
 - HoP 2",219.0
6521,"This is a method of treating of Philosophy which has great efficacy, and which in our time has likewise been applied, eg by the French. 
 - HoP 2",145.0
6522,"It deserves to come into larger use, for it is a good thing to lead the determinations of the ordinary conception from an object to thought, and then to unite them in a unity, in the Notion. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
6527,"However, in his genuine speculation Aristotle is as profound as Plato, and at the same time more developed and explicit, for with him the opposites receive a higher determination. 
 - HoP 2",189.0

6531,"The study of Aristotle is hence inexhaustible, but to give an account of him is difficult, because his teaching must be reduced to universal principles. 
 - HoP 2",162.0
6532,"Thus in order to set forth Aristotelian philosophy, the particular content of each thing would have to be specified. 
 - HoP 2",126.0

 - HoP 2",77.0
6537,"Aristotle has further declared the chief subject of investigation, or the most essential knowledge  to be the knowledge of end; but this is the good in each thing and, generally speaking, the best in the whole of nature.

6539,"Aristotle then says of the value of Philosophy, Men have begun to philosophize through wonder,  for in it the knowledge of something higher is at least anticipated. 
 - HoP 2",174.0
6540,"Thus since man, to escape from ignorance, began to philosophize, it is clear that for the sake of knowledge he followed after knowledge, and not for any utility which it might possess for him. 
 - HoP 2",202.0
6541,"This is also made evident by the whole course of its external history. 
 - HoP 2",80.0

6561,"From the whole list of conceptions which Aristotle enumerates, we shall now select some for further examination, and I will first speak of his metaphysics and its determinations. 
 - HoP 2",188.0
6563,"Aristotles speculative Idea is chiefly to be gathered from his Metaphysics, especially from the last chapters of the twelfth book  which deal with the divine Thought. 
 - HoP 2",176.0
6564,"But this treatise has the peculiar drawback noticed above  of being a compilation, several treatises having been combined into one. 
 - HoP 2",141.0
6565,"Aristotle and the ancients did not know this work by the name of the Metaphysics; it was by them called ÏÏÏÏÎ· ÏÎ¹Î»Î¿ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¯Î±. 
 - HoP 2",142.0
6566,"The main portion of this treatise has a certain appearance of unity given to it by the connection of the argument,88 but it cannot be said that the style is orderly and lucid. 
 - HoP 2",185.0
6567,"This pure philosophy Aristotle very clearly distinguishes  from the other sciences as the science of that which is, in so far as it is, and of what belongs to it implicitly and explicitly. 
 - HoP 2",198.0
6568,"The main object which Aristotle has in view  is the definition of what this substance  really is. 
 - HoP 2",107.0
6572,"These are determinations which occur repeatedly in Aristotle, especially in the ninth book of the Metaphysics, and which we must be familiar with, if we would understand him. 
 - HoP 2",184.0
6573,"The expression Î´ÏÎ½Î±Î¼Î¹Ï is with Aristotle the beginning, the implicit, the objective; also the abstract universal in general, the Idea, the matter, which can take on all forms, without being itself the form-giving principle. 
 - HoP 2",240.0
6574,"But with an empty abstraction such as the thing-in-itself Aristotle has nothing to do. 
 - HoP 2",96.0
6575,"It is first in energy or, more concretely, in subjectivity, that he finds the actualizing form, the self-relating negativity. 
 - HoP 2",135.0
6576,"When, on the other hand, we speak of Being, activity is not yet posited: Being is only implicit, only potentiality, without infinite form. 
 - HoP 2",148.0
6577,"To Aristotle the main fact about Substance is that it is not matter merely ; although in ordinary life this is what is generally taken to be the substantial. 
 - HoP 2",167.0
6579,"With Aristotle Î´ÏÎ½Î±Î¼Î¹Ï does not therefore mean force , but rather capacity which is not even undetermined possibility; á¼Î½Î­ÏÎ³ÎµÎ¹Î± is, on the other hand, pure, spontaneous activity. 
 - HoP 2",204.0
6580,"These definitions were of importance throughout all the middle ages. 
 - HoP 2",78.0
6582,"From this definition we now see clearly the sort of opposition in which the Idea of Aristotle stands to that of Plato, for although the Idea of Plato is in itself essentially concrete and determined, Aristotle goes further. 
 - HoP 2",233.0
6583,"In so far, namely, as the Idea is determined in itself, the relation of the moments in it can be more closely specified, and this relation of the moments to each other is to be conceived of as nothing other than activity. 
 - HoP 2",231.0
6584,"It is easy for us to have a consciousness of what is deficient in the universal, that is, of that which is implicit only. 
 - HoP 2",131.0
6585,"The universal, in that it is the universal, has as yet no reality, for because implicitude is inert, the activity of realization is not yet posited therein. 
 - HoP 2",166.0
6586,"Reason, laws, etc, are in this way abstract, but the rational, as realizing itself, we recognize to be necessary, and therefore we take such universal laws but little into account. 
 - HoP 2",190.0
6587,"Now the standpoint of Plato is in the universal; what he does is to express Being rather as the objective, the Good, the end, the universal. 
 - HoP 2",150.0
6588,"To this, however, the principle of living subjectivity, as the moment of reality, seems to be lacking, or it appears at least to be put in the background. 
 - HoP 2",164.0
6590,"But with Aristotle this negativity, this active efficacy, is expressly characterized as energy; in that it breaks up itself-this independence-abrogating unity, and positing separation; for, as Aristotle says , actuality separates. 
 - HoP 2",240.0
6591,"The Platonic Idea, on the other hand, is rather that abrogation of opposites, where one of the opposites is itself unity. 
 - HoP 2",131.0
6593,"The principle of individualization, not in the sense of a casual and merely particular subjectivity, but in that of pure subjectivity, is peculiar to Aristotle. 
 - HoP 2",170.0
6594,"Aristotle thus also makes the Good, as the universal end, the substantial foundation, and maintains this position against Heraclitus and the Eleatics. 
 - HoP 2",160.0
6595,"The Becoming of Heraclitus is a true and real determination, but change yet lacks the determination of identity with itself, the constancy of the universal. 
 - HoP 2",166.0
6596,"The stream is ever changing, yet it is nevertheless ever the same, and is really a universal existence. 
 - HoP 2",113.0
6599,"As he maintains the universal against the principle of mere change, he puts forward activity in opposition to the numbers of the Pythagoreans, and to the Platonic Ideas. 
 - HoP 2",179.0
6601,"He says also that Ideas, as abstract universal determinations, are only as far as numbers go equal to things, but are not on that account to be pointed out as their causes. 
 - HoP 2",182.0
6602,"Moreover, he maintains that there are contradictions involved in taking independent species, since in Socrates, for instance, there are several ideas included: man, biped, animal. 
 - HoP 2",189.0
6604,"This is the chief point which Aristotle deals with. 
 - HoP 2",61.0
6605,"Aristotle distinguishes various moments in substance, in so far as the moments of activity and potentiality do not appear as one, but still in separation. 
 - HoP 2",164.0
6606,"The closer determination of this relation of energy to potentiality, of form to matter, and the movement of this opposition, gives the different modes of substance. 
 - HoP 2",174.0
6607,"Here Aristotle enumerates the substances; and to him they appear as a series of different kinds of substance, which he merely takes into consideration one by one, without bringing them together into a system. 
 - HoP 2",218.0
6608,"The three following are the chief among these:-  a. 
 - HoP 2",61.0
6609,"The sensuous perceptible substance is that in which the matter is still distinguished from the efficient form. 
 - HoP 2",120.0
6610,"Hence this substance is finite; for the separation and externality of form and matter are precisely what constitute the nature of the finite. 
 - HoP 2",151.0
6612,"Now the leading categories of change which Aristotle names are the four differences, in regard to the What , or in regard to quality , or in regard to quantity , or in regard to place where. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
6613,"The first change is the origination and decay of simple determinate Being ; the second change is that of the further qualities ; the third, increase and diminution; the fourth, motion. 
 - HoP 2",194.0
6614,"Matter is the dead substance on which take place the changes which matter passes through. 
 - HoP 2",99.0
6615,"The change itself is from potential into actual existence; possible whiteness transforms itself into actual whiteness. 
 - HoP 2",128.0
6616,"Thus things do not arise casually out of nothing, but all arises out of what exists, though it exists only in potentiality, not in actuality. 
 - HoP 2",151.0
6617,"The possible is thus really a general implicit existence, which brings about these determinations, without producing one out of the other. 
 - HoP 2",148.0
6618,"Matter is thus simple potentiality, which, however, is placed in opposition to itself, so that a thing in its actuality only becomes that which its matter was also in potentiality. 
 - HoP 2",190.0
6620,"But activity is the unity of form and matter; how these two are in the other, Aristotle does not, however, further explain. 
 - HoP 2",133.0
6622,"A higher kind of substance, according to Aristotle , is that into which activity enters, which already contains that which is about to be. 
 - HoP 2",148.0
6623,"This is understanding, absolutely determined, whose content is the aim which it realizes through its activity, not merely changing as does the sensuous form. 
 - HoP 2",167.0
6624,"For the soul is essentially actuality, a general determination which posits itself; not only formal activity, whose content comes from somewhere else. 
 - HoP 2",160.0
6625,"But while the active posits its content in reality, this content yet remains the same; there is an activity present which is different from matter, although substance and activity are allied. 
 - HoP 2",201.0
6626,"Thus here we still have a matter which understanding demands as its hypothesis. 
 - HoP 2",89.0
6628,"In these two moments themselves change does not take place, for they are the implicit universal in opposed forms. 
 - HoP 2",123.0
6630,"For matter as such is passive and affected by change, consequently it is not simply one with the pure activity of this substance. 
 - HoP 2",139.0
6631,"Here as elsewhere we certainly see an instance of merely denying a predicate, without saying what its truth is; but matter is nothing else than that moment of unmoved Being. 
 - HoP 2",183.0
6632,"If in later times it has seemed something new to define absolute Being as pure activity, we see that this arises from ignorance as to the Aristotelian conception. 
 - HoP 2",172.0
6633,"But the Schoolmen rightly looked upon this as the definition of God, since they define God as actus purus; and higher idealism than this there is none. 
 - HoP 2",161.0
6635,"In this Aristotle breaks away from Plato, and for this reason controverts number, the Idea, and the universal, because if this, as inert, is not defined as identical with activity, there is no movement. 
 - HoP 2",212.0
6636,"Platos inert Ideas and numbers thus bring nothing into reality; but far different is the case with the Absolute of Aristotle, which in its quiescence is at the same time absolute activity. 
 - HoP 2",198.0
6637,"Aristotle further says on this subject : It may be that what has potentiality is not real; it is of no avail therefore to make substances eternal, as the idealists do, if they do not contain a principle which can effect change. 
 - HoP 2",237.0
6638,"And even this is insufficient, if it is not active, because in that case there is no change. 
 - HoP 2",102.0
6639,"Yea, even if it were active, but its substance only a potentiality, there would be in it no eternal movement, for it is possible that what is according to potentiality may not exist. 
 - HoP 2",192.0
6640,"We must therefore have a principle whose substance must be apprehended as activity. 
 - HoP 2",93.0
6641,"Thus in mind energy is substance itself. 
 - HoP 2",50.0
6642,"But here a doubt seems to spring up. 
 - HoP 2",46.0
6643,"For all that is active seems to be possible, but all that is possible does not seem to energize, so that potentiality seems to be antecedent,  for it is the universal. 
 - HoP 2",177.0
6644,"But if this were the case, no one of the entities would be in existence, for it is possible that a thing may possess a capacity of existence, though it has never yet existed. 
 - HoP 2",184.0
6645,"But energy is higher than potentiality. 
 - HoP 2",49.0
6646,"We must thus not assert, as theologians would have us do, that in the eternal ages there was first chaos or night  , nor must we say with natural philosophers that everything existed simultaneously. 
 - HoP 2",208.0
6647,"For how could the First be changed, if nothing in reality were cause? For matter does not move itself, it is the Master who moves it. 
 - HoP 2",143.0
6648,"Leucippus and Plato accordingly say that motion has always existed, but they give no reason for the assertion. 
 - HoP 2",120.0
6649,"Pure activity is, according to Aristotle , before potentiality, not in relation to time, but to essence. 
 - HoP 2",114.0
6651,"In the former assumption of a chaos and so on, an activity is posited which has to do with something else, not with itself, and has therefore a pre-supposition; but chaos is only bare possibility. 
 - HoP 2",206.0
6652,"That which moves in itself, and therefore, as Aristotle continues , that which has circular motion;  is to be posited as the true Being, and this is evident not merely from thinking reason, but also from the fact itself. 
 - HoP 2",230.0
6653,"From the definition of absolute Being as imparting motion, as bringing about realization, there follows that it exists in objectivity in visible nature. 
 - HoP 2",162.0
6654,"As the self-identical which is visible, this absolute Being is the eternal heavens. 
 - HoP 2",93.0
6655,"The two modes of representing the Absolute are thus thinking reason and the eternal heavens. 
 - HoP 2",102.0
6656,"The heavens are moved, but they also cause movement. 
 - HoP 2",62.0
6657,"Since the spherical is thus both mover and moved, there is a centre-point which causes movement but remains unmoved, and which is itself at the same time eternal and a substance and energy. 
 - HoP 2",199.0
6658,"He explains this as follows: Its motion is determined in the following manner. 
 - HoP 2",88.0
6659,"That moves which is desired and thought, whereas itself it is unmoved, and the original of both is the same. 
 - HoP 2",118.0
6660,"That is the end whose content is the desire and thought; such an end is the Beautiful or the Good. 
 - HoP 2",108.0
6661,"For the thing that is desired is that which appears beautiful  : whose first  , on which the will is set, is what is beautiful. 
 - HoP 2",137.0
6662,"But it is rather the case that we desire it because it appears beautiful, than that it appears beautiful because we desire it. 
 - HoP 2",136.0
6663,"For if that were so, it would be simply posited by activity, but it is posited independently, as objective Being, through which our desire is first awakened. 
 - HoP 2",167.0
6664,"But thought is the true principle in this, for thought is moved only by the object of thought. 
 - HoP 2",104.0
6666,"Such are the Beautiful and the Good, and the first is ever the absolutely best or the best possible. 
 - HoP 2",110.0
6667,"But the Notion shows that the final cause belongs to the unmoved. 
 - HoP 2",75.0
6668,"What is moved may also subsist in a different manner. 
 - HoP 2",63.0
6669,"Motion  is the first change; the first motion, again, is circular motion, but this is due to the above cause. 
 - HoP 2",119.0
6670,"Therefore, according to Aristotle, the Notion, principium cognoscendi, is also that which causes movement, principium essendi; he expresses it as God, and shows the relation of God to the individual consciousness. 
 - HoP 2",223.0
6671,"The First Cause is necessary. 
 - HoP 2",39.0
6673,"On such a principle of the unmoved the heavens depend and the whole of nature -the visible that is eternal, and the visible that changes. 
 - HoP 2",147.0
6674,"This system is ever-enduring. 
 - HoP 2",39.0
6675,"But to us  as individuals, there is granted, for a short time only, a sojourn therein of surpassing excellence. 
 - HoP 2",121.0
6676,"For the system continues ever the same, but for us that is impossible. 
 - HoP 2",80.0
6677,"Now this activity is in its very self enjoyment, and therefore vigilance, exercise of the senses, thinking in general, are most productive of enjoyment; and for the same reason hopes and memories bring pleasure. 
 - HoP 2",221.0
6678,"But thinking, in its pure essence, is a thinking of that which is absolutely the most excellent;  the thought is for itself absolute end. 
 - HoP 2",147.0
6681,"The object of thought is first produced in the activity of thinking, which in this way separates the thought as an object. 
 - HoP 2",132.0
6683,"The chief moment in Aristotles philosophy is accordingly this, that the energy of thinking and the object of thought are the same; for thought is that which is receptive of objects of perception and the existent. 
 - HoP 2",222.0
6685,"It is not the object of thought that is the more excellent, but the very energy of thinking; the activity of apprehension brings that to pass which appears as something that is being apprehended. 
 - HoP 2",205.0
6686,"Speculation  is thus the most pleasing and the best. 
 - HoP 2",62.0
6687,"If then God has eternally subsisted in such surpassing excellence as for a limited time pertains to us  , He is worthy of admiration; if He possesses it in a more eminent degree, His nature is still more admirable. 
 - HoP 2",224.0
6688,"But this is His mode of subsistence. 
 - HoP 2",46.0
6689,"Life is also inherent in Him, for the activity of thought is life. 
 - HoP 2",76.0
6690,"But He constitutes this efficient power; essential energy belongs to God as His most excellent and eternal life. 
 - HoP 2",122.0
6691,"We therefore say that with God there is life perfect and everlasting. 
 - HoP 2",79.0
6692,"From this substance Aristotle moreover excludes magnitude. 
 - HoP 2",68.0
6694,"With Aristotle it is thus no dry identity of the abstract understanding that is indicated, for he distinguishes subjective and objective precisely and decisively. 
 - HoP 2",172.0
6695,"Not dead identity such as this, but energy, is for him what is most to be reverenced, God. 
 - HoP 2",100.0
6697,"If Aristotle had made the jejune identity of understanding, or experience, his principle, he would never have risen to a speculative Idea like this, wherein individuality and activity are placed higher than universal potentiality. 
 - HoP 2",240.0
6700,"He does not say that it alone is truth, that all is summed up in Thought, but he says it is the first, the strongest, the most honourable. 
 - HoP 2",148.0
6702,"Thus, although Aristotle does not express himself in modern philosophic language, he has yet throughout the same fundamental theory; he speaks not of a special kind of reason, but of the universal Reason. 
 - HoP 2",214.0
6703,"The speculative philosophy of Aristotle simply means the direction of thought on all kinds of objects, thus transforming these into thoughts; hence, in being thoughts, they exist in truth. 
 - HoP 2",198.0
6705,"But in Nature the Notion does not exist explicitly as thought in this freedom, but has flesh and blood, and is oppressed by externalities; yet this flesh and blood has a soul, and this is its Notion. 
 - HoP 2",209.0
6707,"It is only in thought that there is present a true harmony between objective and subjective; that constitutes me. 
 - HoP 2",123.0
6708,"Aristotle therefore finds himself at the highest standpoint; nothing deeper can we desire to know, although he has always the appearance of making ordinary conceptions his starting-point. 
 - HoP 2",197.0
6709,"Aristotle  now solves many other doubtful questions, for instance, whether thought is compound, and whether science is the object of science itself. 
 - HoP 2",158.0
6710,"Some further doubts arise as to thought , which seems to be of all things the most divine; but it is only with difficulty that we can conceive under what conditions  it is a thing of this sort. 
 - HoP 2",203.0
6712,"In this way it would not be the highest substance; for it is   thought  that gives it its high rank. 
 - HoP 2",110.0
6714,"In the next place, something else would be more excellent than thought, namely that which is thought ; and thinking and thought  will be present to the mind in understanding what is most inferior. 
 - HoP 2",206.0
6715,"As this is to be avoided , thinking would not constitute the best. 
 - HoP 2",76.0
6716,"Thought is therefore this, to think itself, because it is the most excellent; and it is the thinking, which is the thinking of thinking. 
 - HoP 2",146.0
6717,"For understanding and sensation and opinion and deliberation seem always to have an object other than themselves, and to be their own objects only in a secondary sense. 
 - HoP 2",178.0
6718,"Further, if thinking and being thought of are different, in relation to which of the two is the Good inherent in thought? For the Notion92 of thinking and that of the object of thought are not the same. 
 - HoP 2",212.0
6720,"As therefore thought and the object of thought are not different, these opposites, so far as they involve no connection with matter, are the same thing, and there is only a thought of the thing thought of. 
 - HoP 2",215.0
6721,"Reason which thinks itself, is the absolute end or the Good, for it only exists for its own sake. 
 - HoP 2",107.0
6722,"There still remains a doubt whether that which thinks is of composite nature or not; for it might undergo change in the parts of the whole. 
 - HoP 2",149.0
6723,"But the Good is not in this or that part, for it is the best in the universe, as distinguished from it. 
 - HoP 2",113.0
6724,"In this way the Thought which is its own object subsists to all eternity. 
 - HoP 2",83.0
6725,"As this speculative Idea, which is the best and most free, is also to be seen in nature, and not only in thinking reason, Aristotle  in this connection passes on to the visible God, which is the heavens. 
 - HoP 2",213.0
6726,"God, as living God, is the universe; and thus in the universe God, as living God, shows Himself forth.

6727,"He comes forth as manifesting Himself or as causing motion, and it is in manifestation alone that the difference between the cause of motion and that which is moved comes to pass. 
 - HoP 2",189.0
6728,"The principle and the first cause of that which is, is itself unmoved, but brings to pass the original and eternal and single motion,  that is, the heaven of the fixed stars. 
 - HoP 2",184.0
6729,"We see that besides the simple revolution of the universe, which is brought about by the first unmoved substance, there are other eternal motions, those of the planets.

6730,"We must not, however, enter into further details on this subject. 
 - HoP 2",75.0
6734,"For all are co-ordinated into one system just as in a house it is by no means permitted to the free inmates to do freely whatever they like, but all that they do, or the most of it, is done according to orderly arrangement.

 - HoP 2",207.0
6739,"Amongst the special sciences treated by Aristotle, the Physics is contained in a whole series of physical treatises, which form a tolerably complete system of what constitutes the Philosophy of Nature in its whole extent. 
 - HoP 2",231.0
6740,"We shall try to give their general plan. 
 - HoP 2",50.0
6741,"Aristotles first work is his Treatise, in eight books, on Physics, or on the Principles. 
 - HoP 2",98.0
6742,"In this he deals, as is fitting, with the doctrine of the Notion of nature generally, with movement, and with space and time. 
 - HoP 2",135.0
6746,"Then follow the treatises on Production and Destruction, the physical process of change, while formerly the ideal process of movement was considered. 
 - HoP 2",159.0
6748,"Then comes the Meteorology; it represents the universal physical process in its most real forms. 
 - HoP 2",106.0
6750,"Nothing is forgotten, and yet the presentation is, on the whole, empiric. 
 - HoP 2",83.0
6752,"From this point Aristotle proceeds to organic nature, and here his works not only contain a natural history, but also a physiology and anatomy. 
 - HoP 2",153.0
6753,"To the anatomy pertain his works on the Locomotion of Animals, and on the Parts of Animals. 
 - HoP 2",101.0
6755,"Finally, there comes the History of Animals, not merely as a history of Nature, but also as the history of the animal in its entirety-what we may call a kind of physiologico-anatomical anatomy. 
 - HoP 2",203.0
6756,"There is likewise a botanical work On Plants  which is ascribed to him. 
 - HoP 2",81.0
6757,"Thus we here find natural philosophy in the whole extent of its outward content. 
 - HoP 2",90.0
6758,"As regards this plan, there is no question that this is not the necessary order in which natural philosophy or physics must be treated. 
 - HoP 2",145.0
6763,"But in regard to the content they express no better the truth of things, but only the sensuous manifestation. 
 - HoP 2",119.0
6764,"Aristotle and the ancients understand by physics, on the other hand, the comprehension of nature-the universal; and for this reason Aristotle also calls it the doctrine of principles. 
 - HoP 2",193.0
6765,"For in the manifestation of nature this distinction between the principle and what follows it, manifestation, really commences, and it is abrogated only in genuine speculation. 
 - HoP 2",186.0
6766,"Yet if, on the one hand, what is physical in Aristotle is mainly philosophic and not experimental, he yet proceeded in his Physics in what may be called an empiric way. 
 - HoP 2",178.0
6768,"One part is not universal enough to embrace the other part, for each is independent. 
 - HoP 2",94.0
6770,"In regard to the general conception of nature, we must say that Aristotle represents it in the highest and truest manner. 
 - HoP 2",131.0
6771,"For in the Idea of nature Aristotle  really relies on two determinations: the conception of end and the conception of necessity. 
 - HoP 2",138.0
6772,"Aristotle at once grasps the whole matter in its principles, and this constitutes the old contradiction and divergence of view existing between necessity  and end , which we have inherited. 
 - HoP 2",199.0
6773,"The first mode of consideration is that in accordance with external necessity, which is the same as chance-the conception that all that pertains to nature is determined from without by means of natural causes. 
 - HoP 2",219.0
6774,"The other mode of consideration is the teleological, but conformity to end is either inward or outward, and in the more recent culture the latter has long retained the supremacy. 
 - HoP 2",188.0
6775,"Thus men vibrate in their opinion between these two points of view, seek external causes, and war against the form of an external teleology which places the end outside of nature. 
 - HoP 2",189.0
6776,"These determinations were known to Aristotle, and he thoroughly investigates them and considers what they are and mean. 
 - HoP 2",129.0
6777,"Aristotles conception of nature is, however, nobler than that of to-day, for with him the principal point is the determination of end as the inward determinateness of natural things. 
 - HoP 2",192.0
6779,"In this doctrine Aristotle has before his eyes the inward immanent end, to which he considers necessity an external condition. 
 - HoP 2",136.0
6781,"In nature we usually think of necessity first, and understand as the essentially natural that which is not determined through end. 
 - HoP 2",140.0
6782,"For long men thought that they determined nature both philosophically and truly in limiting it to necessity. 
 - HoP 2",118.0
6783,"But the aspect of nature has had a stigma removed from it, because, by means of its conformity to the end in view, it is elevated above the commonplace. 
 - HoP 2",162.0
6784,"The two moments which we have considered in substance, the active form and matter, correspond with these two determinations. 
 - HoP 2",134.0
6785,"We must first consider the conception of adaptation to end as the ideal moment in substance. 
 - HoP 2",102.0
6786,"Aristotle begins  with the fact that the natural is the self-maintaining, all that is difficult is its comprehension. 
 - HoP 2",127.0
6788,"The vapour driven upwards cools, and the water resulting from this cooling falls as rain, and it happens that the corn is thereby made to grow. 
 - HoP 2",153.0
6789,"In like manner, if the corn of any one is destroyed, it does not rain for the sake of this destruction, but this is an accidental circumstance. 
 - HoP 2",153.0
6790,"That is to say, there is a necessary connection which, however, is an external relation, and this is the contingency of the cause as well as of the effect. 
 - HoP 2",165.0
6794,"Without going back to the fabulous monstrosities of the ancients, we likewise know of a number of animal tribes which have died out, just because they could not preserve the race. 
 - HoP 2",189.0
6795,"Thus we also require to use the expression development , in our present-day natural philosophy. 
 - HoP 2",105.0
6796,"The conception that the first productions were, so to speak, attempts, of which those which did not show themselves to be suitable could not endure, is easily arrived at by natural philosophy. 
 - HoP 2",202.0
6797,"But nature, as entelecheia or realization, is what brings forth itself. 
 - HoP 2",81.0
6798,"Aristotle hence replies: It is impossible to believe this. 
 - HoP 2",68.0
6799,"For what is produced in accordance with nature is always, or at least for the most part, produced  , but this is not so with what happens through fortune or through chance. 
 - HoP 2",182.0
6804,"Leaves, blossoms, roots thus bring the plant into evidence and go back into it; and that which they bring to pass is already present in the seed from which they took their origin. 
 - HoP 2",189.0
6806,"But the self-maintaining activity of life really brings forth this unity in all relationships. 
 - HoP 2",104.0
6807,"What has here been said is already contained in that which was asserted by those who do not represent nature in this way, but say, that which is constituted as though it were constituted for an end, will endure. 
 - HoP 2",221.0
6808,"For this is the self-productive action of nature. 
 - HoP 2",59.0
6810,"In the Kantian philosophy we for the first time have that conception once more awakened in us, for organic nature at least; life has there been made an end to itself. 
 - HoP 2",176.0
6812,"The fact that most recent times have brought back the rational view of the matter into our remembrance, is thus none else than a justification of the Aristotelian Idea. 
 - HoP 2",178.0
6814,"For this instinctive action exhibits an operation of self-preservation, as a means whereby natural existence becomes shut up and reflected into itself. 
 - HoP 2",161.0
6816,"For the active form has a content, which, as content of potentiality, contains the means which make their appearance as adapted for an end, ie as moments established through the determinate Notion. 
 - HoP 2",207.0
6819,"This activity in transformation thus does not depend in a contingent way on life; it is aroused through the outward powers, but only in as far as conformity with the soul of the animal permits. 
 - HoP 2",203.0
6820,"In passing, Aristotle here  makes a comparison between nature and art, which also connects what results with what goes before, in accordance with ends. 
 - HoP 2",161.0
6821,"Nature may commit an error as well as art; for as a grammarian sometimes makes a mistake in writing, and a physician in mixing a medicinal draught, nature, too, sometimes does not attain its ends. 
 - HoP 2",206.0
6822,"Its errors are monstrosities and deformities, which, however, are only the errors of that which operates for an end. 
 - HoP 2",126.0
6823,"In the production of animals and plants, an animal is not at first produced, but the seed, and even in it corruption is possible. 
 - HoP 2",139.0
6824,"For the seed is the mean, as being the not as yet established, independent, indifferent, free actuality. 
 - HoP 2",114.0
6825,"In this comparison of nature with art we ordinarily have before us the external adaptation to end, the teleological point of view, the making for definite ends. 
 - HoP 2",170.0
6827,"The understanding comes forward with the determination of this end, and with its instruments and tools, to operate on matter, and we carry this conception of an external teleology over into nature. 
 - HoP 2",207.0
6828,"But art also,  says Aristotle, does not deliberate. 
 - HoP 2",61.0
6829,"If the form of a ship were the particular inward principle of the timber, it would act as nature prompted. 
 - HoP 2",116.0
6830,"The action of nature is very similar to the exercise of the art whereby anyone heals himself. 
 - HoP 2",103.0
6832,"As Aristotle has hitherto combated an external teleology, he directs another equally applicable remark  against merely external necessity, and thus we come to the other side, or to how necessity exists in nature. 
 - HoP 2",222.0
6834,"But Aristotle thus explains the facts of the case. 
 - HoP 2",60.0
6835,"The house is certainly not made without these materials, but not on account of, or through them , but it is made for the sake of concealing and preserving certain things. 
 - HoP 2",180.0
6836,"The same takes place in everything which has an end in itself; for it is not without that which is necessary to its nature, and yet it is not on account of this, unless the matter so demands, but on account of an end. 
 - HoP 2",227.0
6837,"Hence the necessary is from hypothesis only, and not as end, for necessity is in matter, but end is in reason. 
 - HoP 2",120.0
6838,"Thus it is clear that matter and its movement are necessity in natural things; both have to be set forth as principle, but end is the higher principle. 
 - HoP 2",161.0
6839,"It undoubtedly requires necessity, but it retains it in its own power, does not allow it to give vent to itself, but controls external necessity. 
 - HoP 2",155.0
6840,"The principle of matter is thus turned into the truly active ground of end, which means the overthrow of necessity, so that that which is natural shall maintain itself in the end. 
 - HoP 2",189.0
6841,"Necessity is the objective manifestation of the action of its moments as separated, just as in chemistry the essential reality of both the extremes-the base and the acid-is the necessity of their relation. 
 - HoP 2",215.0
6842,"This is the main conception of Aristotelian Physics. 
 - HoP 2",62.0
6844,"Thus he at first  proceeds from this point to movement , and says that it is essential that a philosophy of nature should speak of it, but that it is difficult to grasp; in fact, it is one of the most difficult conceptions. 
 - HoP 2",233.0
6846,"He explains this thus: Brass is in capacity a statue; yet the motion to become a statue is not a motion of the brass so far as it is brass, but a motion of itself, as the capacity to become a statue. 
 - HoP 2",209.0
6847,"Hence this activity is an imperfect one ,  ie it has not its end within itself, for mere capacity, whose activity is movement, is imperfect. 
 - HoP 2",150.0
6848,"The absolute substance, the moving immovable, the existent ground of heaven which we saw as end, is, on the contrary, both activity itself and the content and object of activity. 
 - HoP 2",188.0
6849,"But Aristotle distinguishes from this what falls under the form of this opposition, That moving is also moved which has movement as a capacity, and whose immobility is rest. 
 - HoP 2",183.0
6850,"That in which movement is present has immobility as rest; for activity in rest, as such, is movement. 
 - HoP 2",111.0
6851,"That is to say, rest is capacity for motion. 
 - HoP 2",54.0
6852,"Hence movement is the activity of that which is movable ,93 so far as it is movable; but this happens from the contact of that which is motive , so that at the same time it is posited as passive likewise. 
 - HoP 2",214.0
6854,"Thus, too, it is evident that movement is in the movable thing: for it is the activity of this, and is derived from that which is motive. 
 - HoP 2",147.0
6855,"The activity of that which is motive is likewise not different, for both are necessarily activity. 
 - HoP 2",108.0
6856,"It is motive because it has the capacity for being so; but it causes motion because it energizes. 
 - HoP 2",107.0
6858,"Activity and passivity are not originally  the same, but in what they are inherent, in motion, they are the same. 
 - HoP 2",123.0
6859,"In Being  they are identical, but activity, in so far as it is activity of this in this  , and the activity of this from this  , is different as regards its conception. 
 - HoP 2",178.0
6860,"Aristotle subsequently deals with the infinite. 
 - HoP 2",57.0
6861,"In like manner it is necessary,  says Aristotle , that the natural philosopher should consider the subject of place. 
 - HoP 2",126.0
6862,"Here come various definitions and determinations under which space generally and particular space or place appear. 
 - HoP 2",124.0
6863,"Is place a body? It cannot be a body, for then there would be in one and the same, two bodies. 
 - HoP 2",104.0
6865,"But in truth there is no difference between the point and the place of the point, so that if place is not different from the other forms of limitation, neither is it something outside of them. 
 - HoP 2",202.0
6866,"It is not an element, and neither consists of corporeal nor of incorporeal elements, for it possesses magnitude, but not body. 
 - HoP 2",136.0
6867,"The elements of bodies are, however, themselves bodies, and no magnitude is produced from intelligible elements. 
 - HoP 2",122.0
6868,"Place is not the material of things, for nothing consists of it-neither the form, nor the Notion, nor the end, nor the moving cause; and yet it is something. 
 - HoP 2",167.0
6870,"The uttermost ends of what comprehends and of what is comprehended are identical, for both are bounds; but they are not bounds of the same, for form is the boundary of the thing, place is that of the embracing body. 
 - HoP 2",225.0
6871,"Place, as the comprehending, remains unchangeably passive while the thing which is moved is moved away; from which we see that place must be separable from the thing. 
 - HoP 2",176.0
6872,"Or place, according to Aristotle, is the boundary, the negation of a body, the assertion of difference, of discretion; but it likewise does not merely belong to this body, but also to that which comprehends. 
 - HoP 2",217.0
6873,"There is thus no difference at all, but unchangeable continuity. 
 - HoP 2",74.0
6874,"Place is neither the universal  in which all bodies are  , nor the particular , in which they are as the first. 
 - HoP 2",121.0
6875,"Aristotle also speaks of above and below in space, in relation to heaven as that which contains, and earth as what is beneath. 
 - HoP 2",136.0
6876,"That body, outside of which is a comprehending body, is in space. 
 - HoP 2",75.0
6877,"But the whole heavens are not anywhere, since no body comprehends them. 
 - HoP 2",81.0
6878,"Outside the universe nothing is, and hence everything is in the heavens, for the heavens are the whole. 
 - HoP 2",113.0
6879,"Place, however, is not the heavens, but its external quiescent boundary which touches the body moved. 
 - HoP 2",111.0
6880,"Hence the earth is in water, water in air, air in ether, but ether in the heavens. 
 - HoP 2",92.0
6882,"Vacuum, according to ordinary ideas, is a space in which there is no body, and, fancying that all Being is body, they say that vacuum is that in which there is nothing at all. 
 - HoP 2",185.0
6884,"The other argument in favour of a vacuum is found in the compression of bodies, in which the parts press into the empty spaces. 
 - HoP 2",137.0
6885,"This is the conception of varying density and the alteration of the same, in accordance with which an equal weight might consist of an equal number of parts, but these, as being separated by vacuum, might present a greater volume. 
 - HoP 2",240.0
6886,"Aristotle confutes these reasonings most adroitly, and first of all in this way; The plenum could be changed, and bodies could yield to one another even if no interval of vacuum separated them. 
 - HoP 2",203.0
6887,"Liquids as well as solids are not condensed into a vacuum; something that they contained is expelled, just as air is expelled if water is compressed. 
 - HoP 2",159.0
6888,"Aristotle deals more thoroughly, in the first place , with the erroneous conception that the vacuum is the cause of movement. 
 - HoP 2",135.0
6889,"For, on the one hand, he shows that the vacuum really abolishes motion, and consequently in vacuum a universal rest would reign. 
 - HoP 2",138.0
6890,"He calls it perfect indifference as to the greater or less distance to which a thing is moved; in vacuum there are no distinctions. 
 - HoP 2",141.0
6891,"It is pure negation without object or difference; there is no reason for standing still or going on. 
 - HoP 2",110.0
6892,"But body is in movement, and that, indeed, as distinguished; it has a positive relation, and not one merely to nothing. 
 - HoP 2",129.0
6893,"On the other hand, Aristotle refutes the idea that movement is in vacuum because compression is possible. 
 - HoP 2",115.0
6894,"But this does not happen in a vacuum; there would be established in it not one movement, but a movement towards all sides, a general annihilation, an absolute yielding, where no cohesion would remain in the body. 
 - HoP 2",222.0
6897,"The difference in velocity is in inverse ratio to the specific gravity of the medium, air and water, so that if the medium has only half the density, the rate of progress will be double as quick. 
 - HoP 2",205.0
6898,"But vacuum has to body no such relation of differences of specific gravity. 
 - HoP 2",85.0
6899,"Body can no more contain a vacuum within its dimensions than a line can contain a point, unless the line were composed of points. 
 - HoP 2",139.0
6900,"The vacuum has no ratio to the plenum. 
 - HoP 2",48.0
6902,"This point of view is quite correct, and it is mainly directed against a number of conceptions that prevail in our physics. 
 - HoP 2",133.0
6903,"The conception of equal movement of the heavy and the light, as that of pure weight, pure matter, is an abstraction, being taken as though they were inherently like, only differing through the accidental resistance of the air. 
 - HoP 2",236.0
6904,"Aristotle  now comes to the second point, to the proof of the vacuum because of the difference in specific gravity. 
 - HoP 2",125.0
6907,"Now if, as they say, the less dense were that which has many separate void spaces, it is evident that since a vacuum cannot be separated any more than a space can have intervals, neither can the rare subsist in this manner. 
 - HoP 2",233.0
6908,"But if it is not separable, and yet a vacuum is said to exist in the body, in the first place movement could thus only be upwards; for the rare is the light, and hence they say that fire is rare,  because it always moves upwards. 
 - HoP 2",239.0
6909,"In the next place the vacuum cannot be the cause of motion as that in which something moves, but must resemble bladders that carry up that which adheres to them. 
 - HoP 2",171.0
6910,"But how is it possible that a vacuum can move, or that there can be a place where there is a vacuum? For that into which it is carried would be the vacuum of a vacuum. 
 - HoP 2",177.0
6911,"In short, as there can be no movement in vacuum, so also a vacuum cannot move. 
 - HoP 2",88.0
6913,"And again, the matter of a small body and a large is the same, because at one time a greater proceeds from a smaller, and at another time a smaller from a greater. 
 - HoP 2",173.0
6914,"If air is generated from water it is expanded, but the matter remains the same and without taking to itself anything else; for that which it was in capacity it becomes in actuality. 
 - HoP 2",191.0
6915,"In a similar way if air is compressed from a greater into a less volume, the process will be reversed, and air will similarly pass into water, because the matter which is in capacity both air and water, also becomes both. 
 - HoP 2",231.0
6916,"Aristotle likewise asserts that increase and decrease of warmth, and its transition into cold, is no addition or otherwise of warm matter, and also one and the same is both dense and rare. 
 - HoP 2",198.0
6917,"This is very different from the physical conceptions which assert more or less matter to correspond with more or less density, thus comprehending the difference in specific weight as the external addition of matter. 
 - HoP 2",225.0
6918,"Aristotle, on the contrary, takes this dynamically, though certainly not in the sense in which dynamics are to-day understood, viz. 
 - HoP 2",141.0
6919,"Undoubtedly the difference must also be taken as a difference in amount, but not as an increase and decrease, or as an alteration in the absolute quantity of the matter. 
 - HoP 2",179.0
6921,"If the intensity is again directed outwards, and compared with other things, it undoubtedly becomes degree, and therefore magnitude immediately enters in. 
 - HoP 2",164.0
6924,"For one part of it was and is not: another part will be and is not as yet; but of these parts infinite and everlasting , time is composed. 
 - HoP 2",148.0
6925,"But it now appears that time, if composed of things that are not, may be incapable of existence. 
 - HoP 2",106.0
6926,"And also as regards everything divisible, if it exists, either some or all of its parts must be. 
 - HoP 2",106.0
6927,"Time is certainly divisible; but some of the parts are past, others are future, and no part is present. 
 - HoP 2",113.0
6928,"For the now is no part, since a part has a measure, and the whole must consist of the parts; but time does not appear to consist of the Now. 
 - HoP 2",150.0
6929,"That is to say, because the Now is indivisible, it has no quantitative determination which could be measured. 
 - HoP 2",119.0
6930,"Besides it is not easy to decide whether the Now remains, or always becomes another and another. 
 - HoP 2",106.0
6931,"Again, time is not a movement and change, for movement and change occur in that which is moved and changed, or accompany time in its course; but time is everywhere alike. 
 - HoP 2",180.0
6932,"Besides change is swifter and slower, but time is not. 
 - HoP 2",64.0
6933,"But it is not without change and motion   for when we perceive no change, it appears as if no time had elapsed, as in sleep. 
 - HoP 2",134.0
6934,"Time is hence in motion but not motion itself. 
 - HoP 2",56.0
6936,"Now when we understand that the extremes of the conclusion are different from the middle, and the soul says that the Now has two instants, the one prior and the other posterior, then we say that this is time. 
 - HoP 2",218.0
6937,"What is determined through the Now, we call time, and this is the fundamental principle. 
 - HoP 2",98.0
6938,"But when we are sensible of the Now as one, and not as a prior and posterior in motion, nor as the identity of an earlier or later, then there does not appear to us to have been any time, because neither was there any motion. 
 - HoP 2",235.0
6939,"Tedium is thus ever the same. 
 - HoP 2",39.0
6940,"Time is hence the number of motion, according to priority and posteriority; it is not motion itself, unless so far as motion has number. 
 - HoP 2",146.0
6941,"We judge of the more or less through number, but of a greater or less motion by time. 
 - HoP 2",95.0
6942,"But we call number that which can be numbered, as well as that with which we number; but time is not the number with which we number, but that which is numbered, and, like motion, always is changing. 
 - HoP 2",209.0
6943,"The Now is, which is the unity of number, and it measures time. 
 - HoP 2",73.0
6944,"The whole of time is the same, for the Now which was is the same   but in Being it is another. 
 - HoP 2",104.0
6945,"Time thus is through the Now both continuous  and discrete. 
 - HoP 2",69.0
6946,"It thereby resembles the point, for that also is the continuity of the line and its division, its principle and limit; but the Now is not an enduring point. 
 - HoP 2",166.0
6947,"As continuity of time the Now connects the past and the future, but it likewise divides time in capacity,  the Now is only divisibility and the moments only ideal. 
 - HoP 2",173.0
6948,"And in as far as it is such, it is always another; but, in as far as it unites, it is ever one and the same. 
 - HoP 2",118.0
6949,"Similarly, in as far as we divide the line, other and yet other points always arise for thought; but in as far as it is one, there is only one point. 
 - HoP 2",159.0
6950,"Thus the Now is both the division of time in capacity, and the limit and union of both  ie of the prior and posterior. 
 - HoP 2",128.0
6951,"The universally dividing point is only one as actual; but this actual is not permanently one, but ever and again another, so that individuality has universality, as its negativity, within it. 
 - HoP 2",201.0
6952,"But division and union are the same, and similarly related; however their Notion 95 is different. 
 - HoP 2",107.0
6954,"Thus the identity of the understanding is not a principle with Aristotle, for identity and non-identity to him are one and the same. 
 - HoP 2",142.0
6956,"Aristotle  then goes on to movement as realized in a thing, to change  or to the physical processes-while before we had pure movement. 
 - HoP 2",144.0
6957,"In movement there is first something which moves, also something which is moved, and the time in which it is moved; besides these, that from which, and that into which it is moved. 
 - HoP 2",190.0
6958,"For all motion is from something and into something; but there is a difference between that which is first moved and that into which and from which it is moved, as, for instance, wood, warmth and cold. 
 - HoP 2",211.0
6959,"The motion is in the wood and not in the form; for neither form nor place, nor quantity moves or is moved, but   there is that which is moved and that which moves, and that into which it is moved. 
 - HoP 2",206.0
6960,"That to which movement is made, more than that out of which movement is made, is named change. 
 - HoP 2",104.0
6961,"Hence to pass into non-being is also change, although what passes away is changed from Being: and generation is a mutation into Being, even though it is from non-being. 
 - HoP 2",178.0
6962,"The remark is to be interpreted as meaning that for the first time in real becoming motion, ie in change, the relation whereto enters, while the relation wherefrom is that in which change is still the mere ideal motion. 
 - HoP 2",229.0
6964,"The fourth, from a non-subject into a non-subject,  which may also appear in the general division, is no mutation, for it contains no opposition. 
 - HoP 2",155.0
6965,"It may certainly be merely thought or ideal, but Aristotle indicates the actual phenomenon. 
 - HoP 2",101.0
6967,"This opposition of the materialized motion as mutation, and of merely formal motion, is noteworthy. 
 - HoP 2",109.0
6968,"In the sixth book Aristotle comes to the consideration of the dialectic of this motion and change as advanced by Zeno, that is, to the endless divisibility which we have already  considered. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
6969,"Aristotle solves it through the universal. 
 - HoP 2",52.0
6971,"Of the further details into which Aristotle enters, I shall only give the following. 
 - HoP 2",94.0
6972,"As against atoms and their motion, he remarks  that the indivisible has no motion and mutation, which is the direct opposite of the proposition of Zeno that only simple indivisible Being and no motion exists. 
 - HoP 2",218.0
6973,"For as Zeno argues from the indivisibility of atoms against motion, Aristotle argues from motion against atoms. 
 - HoP 2",121.0
6974,"Everything which moves or changes is in the first division of this time partly here and partly there. 
 - HoP 2",111.0
6975,"The atom, as simple indivisible Being, can, however, not have any part of it in both points in space, because it then would be divisible. 
 - HoP 2",147.0
6976,"The indivisible could thus only move if time consisted of the Now; this is, however, impossible, as we proved before. 
 - HoP 2",127.0
6977,"Because atoms thus neither have change in themselves, nor can this come to them from without through impulse, &c, they are really without truth. 
 - HoP 2",154.0
6978,"The determination of the pure ideality of change is important. 
 - HoP 2",72.0
6979,"Aristotle says of this , That which is changed is alone the sensuous and perceptible ; and forms and figures, as also capacities, are not changed, they arise and disappear in a thing only, without being themselves changed. 
 - HoP 2",232.0
6980,"In other words: the content of change is unchangeable; change as such belongs to mere form. 
 - HoP 2",101.0
6981,"Virtues or vices belong, for example, to habits acquired. 
 - HoP 2",67.0
6982,"Virtue is the perfection  in which something has reached the end of its nature. 
 - HoP 2",89.0
6983,"Vice, however, is the corruption and non-attainment of this. 
 - HoP 2",70.0
6984,"They are not changes, for they only arise and pass away while another alters. 
 - HoP 2",87.0
6985,"Or the difference becomes a difference of Being and non-being, ie a merely sensuous difference. 
 - HoP 2",105.0
6986,"From these conceptions Aristotle now comes nearer to the first real or physical motion : The first principle of motion is itself unmoved. 
 - HoP 2",147.0
6987,"An endless motion in a straight line is an empty creation of thought; for motion is necessarily an effort after something. 
 - HoP 2",132.0
6988,"The absolute motion is the circular, because it is without opposition. 
 - HoP 2",80.0
6989,"For because movement has to be considered in regard to the starting-place and the end in view, in the straight movement the directions from A to B and from B to A are opposed, but in motion in a circle they are the same. 
 - HoP 2",230.0
6990,"The idea that heavenly bodies would of themselves have moved in a straight line, but that they accidentally came into the sphere of solar attraction, is an empty reflection which is far from occurring to Aristotle. 
 - HoP 2",224.0
6991,"Aristotle then shows  that the whole heavens neither arose nor can pass away, for they are one and eternal: they neither have beginning nor end in eternal time, for they contain infinite time shut up within them. 
 - HoP 2",222.0
6992,"All the other ideas are sensuous which try to speak of essential reality, and in them there always is that present which they think they have excluded. 
 - HoP 2",161.0
6994,"But in fact a thing does not exist before its origination, ie in movement there is something to move, and where reality is, there is motion. 
 - HoP 2",150.0
6995,"They do not, however, bring together that vacuum, the self-identical, the un-originated matter and this nothing. 
 - HoP 2",122.0
6996,"That which has this absolute circular movement is neither heavy nor light; for the heavy is what moves downwards, and the light what moves upwards. 
 - HoP 2",157.0
6997,"In modern physics the heavenly bodies, on the other hand, are endowed with weight, and seek to rush into the sun, but cannot do so on account of another force. 
 - HoP 2",169.0
6998,"It is indestructible and ungenerated, without decrease or increase, without any change. 
 - HoP 2",97.0
6999,"It is different from earth, fire, air and water; it is what the ancients called ether, as the highest place, from its continuous course  in infinite time. 
 - HoP 2",164.0
7001,"Aristotle  shows further that the elements do not proceed from one body, but from one another; for in generation they neither proceed from what is incorporeal, nor from what is corporeal. 
 - HoP 2",197.0
7002,"In the first case they would have sprung from the vacuum, for the vacuum is the immediate incorporeal; but in that case the vacuum must have existed independently as that in which determinate corporeality arose. 
 - HoP 2",221.0
7003,"But neither do the elements arise from a corporeal, for else this body itself would be a corporeal element before the elements. 
 - HoP 2",137.0
7004,"Thus it only remains that the elements must spring from one another. 
 - HoP 2",78.0
7006,"Aristotle does not consider the universal as it contains the negative within it; else the universal would be the absolute matter whose universality, as negativity, is set forth, or is real. 
 - HoP 2",199.0
7007,"From this point Aristotle comes  to a kind of deduction of the elements, which is noteworthy. 
 - HoP 2",103.0
7008,"He shows that there must be four of them, in the following way-because he starts from the fundamental conceptions of weight and of lightness, or what we should call attraction and centrifugal force. 
 - HoP 2",208.0
7009,"The corporeal, he says, in its motion is neither light nor heavy, and, indeed, it is not only relative but also absolute. 
 - HoP 2",131.0
7010,"The relatively light and heavy is what, while equal in volume, descends more slowly or quickly. 
 - HoP 2",105.0
7011,"Absolute lightness goes up to the extremity of the heavens, absolute weight down into the middle. 
 - HoP 2",107.0
7012,"These extremes are fire and earth. 
 - HoP 2",44.0
7013,"Between these there are mediums, other than they, which relate to one another like them; and these are air and water, the one of which has weight, and the other lightness, but only relatively. 
 - HoP 2",202.0
7014,"For water is suspended under everything except earth, and air over everything except fire. 
 - HoP 2",100.0
7015,"Hence,  Aristotle concludes, there now are these four matters, but they are four in such a way that they have one in common; more particularly, because they arise out of one another, but exist as different. 
 - HoP 2",216.0
7016,"Yet it is not the ether that Aristotle designates as this common matter. 
 - HoP 2",82.0
7021,"But however removed Aristotle may be from understanding simplicity as an abstraction, just as little does he recognize here the arid conception of consisting of parts. 
 - HoP 2",177.0
7022,"Quite the contrary. 
 - HoP 2",29.0
7023,"He strives enough against this, as, for instance, in relation to Anaxagoras. 
 - HoP 2",86.0
7025,"Aristotle excludes the relations which concern sight, smell, &c, and brings forward the others as being those which are of sensible weight or lightness. 
 - HoP 2",162.0
7026,"He gives as these fundamental principles-warmth and cold, dryness and moisture; they are the sensible differences for others, while weight and lightness are different for themselves. 
 - HoP 2",192.0
7028,"And these connections follow those first elements, so that thus fire is warm and dry, air warm and moist , water cold and moist, earth cold and dry. 
 - HoP 2",158.0
7029,"From this Aristotle now makes the reciprocal transformation of the elements into one another comprehensible thus: Origination and decay proceed from the opposite and into the opposite. 
 - HoP 2",194.0
7030,"All elements have a mutual opposite; each is as non-being to the Being of the other, and one is thus distinguished from the other as actuality and capacity. 
 - HoP 2",166.0
7031,"Now amongst these some have an equal part in common; fire and water, for example, have warmth; thus if in fire dryness were overcome by moisture, out of fire air would arise. 
 - HoP 2",184.0
7032,"On the contrary, as regards those which have nothing in common with one another, like earth, which is cold and dry, and air, which is warm and moist, the transition goes more slowly forward. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
7033,"The transition of all elements into one another, the whole process of nature, is thus to Aristotle the constant rotation of their changes. 
 - HoP 2",148.0
7034,"This is unsatisfactory, because neither are the individual elements comprehended nor is the remainder rounded into a whole. 
 - HoP 2",133.0
7035,"As a matter of fact, Aristotle now goes on, in meteorology, to the consideration of the universal process of nature. 
 - HoP 2",126.0
7036,"But here we have reached his limits. 
 - HoP 2",46.0
7037,"Here, in the natural process, the simple determination as such-this system of progressive determination-ceases to hold good, and its whole interest is lost. 
 - HoP 2",166.0
7038,"For it is in the real process that these determinate conceptions always lose their signification again and become their opposite, and in it also this contingent succession is forced together and united. 
 - HoP 2",212.0
7040,"But still more must the following moments, moisture, warmth, &c, themselves come back under the conception of process. 
 - HoP 2",128.0
7041,"But the sensuous manifestation here begins to obtain the upper hand; for the empirical has the nature of the isolated form, which is to fall out of relation. 
 - HoP 2",167.0
7043,"As regards the other side from the Philosophy of Nature, the Philosophy of Mind, we find that Aristotle has constituted in it also a separation into special sciences, in a series of works which I shall name. 
 - HoP 2",217.0
7045,"Thus there are several different treatises, viz. 
 - HoP 2",58.0
7047,"The manner of treatment is almost invariably speculative, and sound understanding is displayed throughout. 
 - HoP 2",116.0
7049,"In Aristotles teaching on this subject we must not expect to find so-called metaphysics of the soul. 
 - HoP 2",110.0
7050,"For metaphysical handling such as this really pre-supposes the soul as a thing, and asks, for example, what sort of a thing it is, whether it is simple, and so on. 
 - HoP 2",173.0
7054,"According to the one view, anger, for instance, is looked on as an eager desire for retaliation or the like; according to the other view it is the surging upward of the heart-blood and the warm element in man. 
 - HoP 2",219.0
7057,"The soul is substance, as being the form of the physical organic body which is possessed potentially of life; but its substance is energy , the energy of a body such as has been described. 
 - HoP 2",198.0
7058,"This energy appears in twofold form: either as knowledge  or as active observation. 
 - HoP 2",93.0
7059,"But it is evident that here it is to be regarded as the former of these. 
 - HoP 2",82.0
7060,"For the soul is present with us both when we sleep and when we wake; waking corresponds with active observation, and sleep with possession and passivity. 
 - HoP 2",163.0
7061,"But knowledge is in origination prior to all else. 
 - HoP 2",60.0
7062,"The soul is thus the first energy of a physical but organic body. 
 - HoP 2",75.0
7063,"It is in respect of this that Aristotle gives to the soul the definition of being the entelechy. 
 - HoP 2",106.0
7064,"In the same chapter Aristotle comes to the question of the mutual relation of body and soul. 
 - HoP 2",102.0
7065,"For this reason   we must no more ask if soul and body are one than we ask if wax and its form are one, or, in general, if matter and its forms are one. 
 - HoP 2",162.0
7066,"For though unity and Being are used in various senses. 
 - HoP 2",64.0
7067,"Being is essentially energy. 
 - HoP 2",38.0
7070,"The only question that now arises is whether activity and the organ it employs are one; and our idea is to answer in the affirmative. 
 - HoP 2",143.0
7071,"The more definite explanation of this relation is to be found in the following; The soul is substance, but only according to the Notion ; but that is the substantial form 96 for such and such a body. 
 - HoP 2",209.0
7073,"But soul is not the substantial form and Notion of such a body as an axe, but of a body which has within itself the principle of movement and of rest. 
 - HoP 2",160.0
7074,"The axe has not the principle of its form in itself, it does not make itself an axe, nor does its form, its Notion, in itself constitute its substance, as its activity is not through itself. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
7075,"If, for instance, the eye were in itself a living thing, vision would be its soul, for vision is the reality which expresses the Notion of the eye. 
 - HoP 2",157.0
7076,"But the eye, as such, is only the material instrument of vision, for if vision were lost, the eye would be an eye only in name, like an eye of stone or a painted eye. 
 - HoP 2",176.0
7077,"Thus to the question, What is the substance of the eye? Aristotle answers: Are the nerves, humours, tissues, its substance? On the contrary, sight itself is its substance, these material substances are only an empty name. 
 - HoP 2",231.0
7078,"As this is the case in the part, so it also holds good of the body as a whole. 
 - HoP 2",88.0
7079,"The potentiality of life is not in any such thing as has lost its soul, but in that which still possesses it. 
 - HoP 2",119.0
7080,"The seed or the fruit is such and such a body potentially. 
 - HoP 2",68.0
7081,"Like hewing and seeing,  in the axe and the eye, waking  in general is activity; but the corporeal is only potentiality. 
 - HoP 2",130.0
7082,"But as the  living eye is both vision and the eyeball  , so also are soul and body the living animal, the two are not to be separated. 
 - HoP 2",144.0
7083,"But it is not yet clear whether the soul is the activity of the body in the same way as the steersman is of the ship. 
 - HoP 2",127.0
7084,"That the active form is the true substance, while matter is so only potentially, is a true speculative Notion. 
 - HoP 2",120.0
7085,"As settling the question asked in the above-mentioned metaphor, we may quote what Aristotle says later : As the principle of motion and as end , and as substance of living bodies, the soul is the cause. 
 - HoP 2",212.0
7086,"For substance is to all objects the cause of their existence, but life is the existence of the living, and its cause and principle is the soul; and further, its energy is the existing Notion of what has potential existence. 
 - HoP 2",233.0
7087,"The soul is cause also as end,  that is, as self-determining universality, for nature, like thought, acts for the sake of an object, which object is its end, but in living beings this is soul. 
 - HoP 2",202.0
7088,"All the parts of the body are thus the organs of the soul, and hence exist for its sake. 
 - HoP 2",98.0
7089,"In like manner Aristotle shows that the soul is the cause of motion. 
 - HoP 2",78.0
7090,"Aristotle  further states that the soul is to be determined in three ways, namely as nutrient or vegetable, as sensitive, and as intelligent, corresponding with plant life, animal life and human life. 
 - HoP 2",210.0
7091,"The nutrient soul, when it is alone, belongs to plants; when it is at the same time capable of sense-perception, it is the animal soul; and when at once nutrient, sensitive and intelligent, it is the mind of man. 
 - HoP 2",222.0
7093,"That difference has also been revived in recent times in the observation of the organic, and it is highly important to keep these sides separate. 
 - HoP 2",155.0
7094,"The only question  is how far these, as parts, are separable. 
 - HoP 2",71.0
7096,"This is a profound observation, by means of which truly speculative thought marks itself out from the thought which is merely logical and formal. 
 - HoP 2",155.0
7098,"On the other hand, the triangle is the first, the truly universal figure, which appears also in the square, &c, as the figure which can be led back to the simplest determination. 
 - HoP 2",188.0
7099,"Therefore, on the one hand, the triangle stands alongside of the square, pentagon, &c, as a particular figure, but-and this is Aristotles main contention-it is the truly universal figure. 
 - HoP 2",197.0
7102,"We can determine these expressions even more particularly. 
 - HoP 2",68.0
7103,"For if we speak of soul and body, we term the corporeal the objective and the soul the subjective; and the misfortune of nature is just this, that it is objective, that is, it is the Notion only implicitly, and not explicitly. 
 - HoP 2",236.0
7104,"In the natural there is, no doubt, a certain activity, but again this whole sphere is only the objective, the implicit element in one higher. 
 - HoP 2",151.0
7105,"As, moreover, the implicit in its sphere appears as a reality for the development of the Idea, it has two sides; the universal is already itself an actual, as, for example, the vegetative soul. 
 - HoP 2",203.0
7106,"Aristotles meaning is therefore this: an empty universal is that which does not itself exist, or is not itself species. 
 - HoP 2",129.0
7107,"All that is universal is in fact real, as particular, individual, existing for another. 
 - HoP 2",97.0
7108,"But that universal is real, in that by itself, without further change, it constitutes its first species, and when further developed it belongs, not to this, but to a higher stage. 
 - HoP 2",189.0
7109,"These are the general determinations which are of the greatest importance, and which, if developed, would lead to all true views of the organic, &c, since they give a correct general representation of the principle of realization. 
 - HoP 2",240.0
7111,"What Aristotle goes on to say of nourishment, for instance, whether the like is nourished by the like, or by the opposite, is of little importance. 
 - HoP 2",157.0
7113,"There is more to interest us in Aristotles determination of sense-perception , as to which I shall make some further quotations. 
 - HoP 2",138.0
7114,"Sense-perception is in general a potentiality , but this potentiality is also activity; it is therefore not to be conceived as mere passivity. 
 - HoP 2",152.0
7115,"Passivity and activity pertain to one and the same, or passivity has two senses. 
 - HoP 2",90.0
7116,"On the one hand a passivity is the destruction of one state by its opposite; on the other hand, it is a preservation of what is merely potential by means of what is actual. 
 - HoP 2",182.0
7118,"From this Aristotle concludes: There is one change which is privative; and another which acts on the nature and the permanent energy. 
 - HoP 2",143.0
7119,"The first change in the subject of perception  is caused by that which produces the perception; but, once produced, the perception is possessed as knowledge. 
 - HoP 2",167.0
7120,"Because that which produces the change is different from the result, perception is passivity; but it is just as much spontaneity, and sense-perception, like knowledge , has to do with this aspect of activity. 
 - HoP 2",218.0
7121,"But the difference is, that what causes the perception is external. 
 - HoP 2",77.0
7122,"The cause of this is that perceptive activity is directed on the particular, while knowledge has as its object the universal; but the universal is, to a certain extent, in the soul itself as its substance. 
 - HoP 2",215.0
7123,"Everyone can therefore think when he will,  and for this very reason thought is free, but perception does not depend on him, having the necessary condition that the object perceived be present. 
 - HoP 2",203.0
7124,"The influence from without, as a passivity, comes therefore first; but there follows the activity of making this passive content ones own. 
 - HoP 2",148.0
7125,"This is doubtless the correct point from which to view perception, whatever be the manner of further development preferred, subjective idealism, or any other way. 
 - HoP 2",172.0
7126,"For it is a matter of perfect indifference whether we find ourselves subjectively or objectively determined; in both there is contained the moment of passivity, by which the perception comes to pass. 
 - HoP 2",209.0
7128,"Here seems to be asserted the highest idealistic freedom, but it is of no avail to imagine that all in me develops out of me; for we must always recollect that what is thus developed in me is passive, and not free. 
 - HoP 2",224.0
7129,"With this moment of passivity Aristotle does not fall short of idealism; sensation is always in one aspect passive. 
 - HoP 2",125.0
7131,"It is one thing when the matter-whether it be sensation, light, colour, seeing or hearing-is apprehended from the Idea, for it is then shown that it comes to pass from the self-determination of the Idea. 
 - HoP 2",213.0
7132,"But it is different when, in so far as I exist as an individual subject, the Idea exists in me as this particular individual; there we have the standpoint of finitude established, and therefore of passivity. 
 - HoP 2",217.0
7135,"Aristotle continues: Speaking generally, the difference is that potentiality is twofold; as we say a boy may become a general, and a grown man may also become so,  for the latter has the effective power. 
 - HoP 2",213.0
7136,"This is the nature of the faculty of sense-perception ; it is in potentiality what the object of sense  is in actuality. 
 - HoP 2",130.0
7137,"Sense-perception is therefore passive, in so far as it does not resemble its object, but after the impression has been made it becomes similar to its object, and is identified with it. 
 - HoP 2",194.0
7138,"The reaction of sense-perception consists therefore in this active receiving into itself of that which is perceived; but this is simply activity in passivity, the spontaneity which abrogates the receptivity in sense-perception. 
 - HoP 2",237.0
7139,"Sense-perception, as made like to itself, has, while appearing to be brought to pass by means of an influence working on it, brought to pass the identity of itself and its object. 
 - HoP 2",189.0
7141,"In speaking of sense-perception, Aristotle  makes use of his celebrated simile, which has so often occasioned misapprehension, because it has been understood quite incorrectly. 
 - HoP 2",186.0
7142,"His words are: Sense-perception is the receiving of sensible forms without matter, as wax receives only the impress of the golden signet ring, not the gold itself, but merely its form. 
 - HoP 2",194.0
7143,"For the form is the object as universal; and theoretically we are in the position, not of the individual and sensuous, but of the universal. 
 - HoP 2",150.0
7144,"The case is different with us in our practical relations, where the influence working upon us pre-supposes in return the contact of the material, for which reason, as Aristotle asserts, plants do not perceive. 
 - HoP 2",219.0
7145,"On the other hand, in receiving form, the material is lost sight of; for the receiving of form indicates no positive relation to the matter, which is no longer something offering resistance. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
7147,"Thus it is said that all sense-perceptions are impressed on the soul by external things, just as the matter of the signet ring works on the matter of the wax; and then we hear it alleged that this is Aristotles philosophy. 
 - HoP 2",232.0
7150,"It does not, however, remain in the same relation to it as that in which the form stands to the wax, nor is it as in chemistry where one element is permeated by another as regards its matter. 
 - HoP 2",201.0
7151,"The chief circumstance, therefore, and that which constitutes the difference between this illustration and the condition of the soul is altogether overlooked. 
 - HoP 2",168.0
7157,"The soul therefore changes the form of the external body into its own, and is identical with an abstract quality such as this, for the sole reason that it itself is this universal form. 
 - HoP 2",195.0
7159,"The bodily organ of each sense-perception receives the object perceived without matter. 
 - HoP 2",97.0
7160,"Hence, when the object of sense is removed, the perceptions and the images which represent them remain in the organs. 
 - HoP 2",127.0
7162,"When that which is the potentiality of hearing comes into exercise, and likewise that which is the potentiality of sound, hearing and sound, being in full activity, coincide,  they do not remain separate energies. 
 - HoP 2",223.0
7164,"As therefore activity and passivity are manifested in the subject which receives the effect, and not in the object which produces it , the energy both of the object and of the faculty of sense-perception is in the faculty itself. 
 - HoP 2",239.0
7165,"For hearing and sounding there are two words, for seeing only one; seeing is the activity of the person who sees, but the activity of the colour is without name. 
 - HoP 2",171.0
7166,"Since the energy of that which is perceived and that which perceives is one energy, and the aspect they present is alone different, the so-called sounding and hearing must cease simultaneously. 
 - HoP 2",203.0
7167,"There is a body which sounds and a subject which hears; they are twofold in the aspect they present, but hearing, taken by itself, is intrinsically an activity of both. 
 - HoP 2",178.0
7169,"It is upon this difference and this identity that everything depends; and Aristotle demonstrates this in the most emphatic way, and holds firmly to his point. 
 - HoP 2",168.0
7170,"The later distinction of subjective and objective is the reflection of consciousness; sense-perception is simply the abrogation of this separation, it is that form of identity which abstracts from subjectivity and objectivity. 
 - HoP 2",236.0
7171,"What is simple, the soul proper or the I, is in sense-perception unity in difference. 
 - HoP 2",95.0
7172,"Further, every sense-perception is in its organ, and distinguishes everything that is perceived, like black and white, and so on. 
 - HoP 2",139.0
7173,"It is thus not possible for separate perceptions, white and sweet, to be distinguished as separate indifferent moments, for both must be present  to one subject. 
 - HoP 2",171.0
7174,"This one subject must therefore determine one thing to be different from another. 
 - HoP 2",91.0
7175,"This, as distinguished, can also not be in a different place or time, for it must be undivided and in undivided time. 
 - HoP 2",127.0
7176,"But it is impossible that one and the same thing should be affected by contrary movements, in so far as it is undivided and in undivided time. 
 - HoP 2",152.0
7179,"Sense-perception and thinking are like that which some term a point, which, in so far as it is one, is inseparable, and in so far as it is two, is separable. 
 - HoP 2",167.0
7180,"So far as it is undivided, the judging faculty is one and acts in a single point of time, but so far as it is divided   it employs the same sign twice simultaneously. 
 - HoP 2",176.0
7181,"So far as it employs two, it by limitation distinguishes two, and separates them as having separate origin; but so far as it is one, it judges by one act in one single point of time. 
 - HoP 2",192.0
7183,"Another example is that of number; one and two are different, and, at the same time, even in two one is used and posited as one. 
 - HoP 2",138.0
7184,"From sense-perception Aristotle passes on to thought, and becomes here really speculative. 
 - HoP 2",100.0
7185,"Thinking,  he says  is not passive , but receptive of the form, and is in potentiality similar to it. 
 - HoP 2",111.0
7187,"Therefore the nature of the understanding is none other than this potentiality. 
 - HoP 2",89.0
7188,"But potentiality itself is here not matter; that is to say, the understanding has no matter, for potentiality pertains to its very substance. 
 - HoP 2",151.0
7189,"For thinking is really the not being implicit; and on account of its purity its reality is not the being-for-another, but its potentiality is itself a being-for-self. 
 - HoP 2",176.0
7190,"A thing is real because it is this determinate thing; the opposite determination, its potentiality to be, for instance, smoke, ashes, and so on, is not posited in it. 
 - HoP 2",176.0
7191,"In the corporeal, therefore, matter, as potentiality, and external form, as reality, are opposed to one another; but the soul is, in contrast with this, universal potentiality itself, without matter, because its essence is energy. 
 - HoP 2",240.0
7192,"Understanding, then, in the soul, as that which possesses consciousness, is nothing in reality before it thinks;  it is absolute activity, but exists only when it is active. 
 - HoP 2",183.0
7193,"It is therefore not incorporated with the body. 
 - HoP 2",57.0
7194,"For what should it be like, warm or cold? Or should it be an organ? But it is none of these. 
 - HoP 2",102.0
7195,"That it is, however, different from the faculty of sense-perception is clear. 
 - HoP 2",87.0
7196,"For sense-perception cannot perceive after a violent perception; for instance, it cannot smell nor see after experiencing strong smells or colours. 
 - HoP 2",157.0
7197,"But the understanding, after it has thought something which can only be thought with difficulty, will not have more but less difficulty in thinking of something that is easier. 
 - HoP 2",186.0
7198,"For there is no sense-perception independent of the body, but the understanding is separable from it. 
 - HoP 2",111.0
7200,"Thinking makes itself into passive understanding, that is, into what is for it the objective; and thus it here becomes plain to what extent the dictum nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu expresses Aristotles meaning. 
 - HoP 2",239.0
7202,"For it is when two objects have something in common that the one appears to produce and the other to receive an impression. 
 - HoP 2",133.0
7203,"There is a further difficulty, whether understanding can itself be the object of thought. 
 - HoP 2",99.0
7205,"Now it has been already said that passivity is so determined that understanding is in potentiality all that thought is exercised on: but at the same time it is in actuality nothing before the exercise of thought. 
 - HoP 2",222.0
7207,"That is an idealistic way of expressing it; and yet they say that Aristotle is an empiricist. 
 - HoP 2",103.0
7209,"Reason is like a book upon whose pages nothing is actually written;  that is, however, paper, but not a book. 
 - HoP 2",119.0
7210,"All Aristotles thoughts are overlooked, and only external illustrations such as this are comprehended. 
 - HoP 2",112.0
7211,"A book on which nothing is written everyone can understand. 
 - HoP 2",69.0
7213,"Instead of the Notion being adhered to, casual comparisons such as these have been caught up here and there by the imagination, as if they expressed the matter itself. 
 - HoP 2",177.0
7215,"The analogy is therefore confined to this, that the soul has a content only in so far as actual thought is exercised. 
 - HoP 2",127.0
7217,"Before real activity nothing truly exists; or Understanding itself can enter thought, like the objects of thought in general. 
 - HoP 2",135.0
7218,"For in that which is without matter  , the thinker   and the thought   are the same; theoretical knowledge and that which comes to be known are the same. 
 - HoP 2",163.0
7220,"It is plain from this that the above illustration has been taken in quite a false sense, utterly contrary to Aristotles meaning. 
 - HoP 2",138.0
7221,"Until now we have spoken of the passive understanding, which is the nature of the soul, but also in equal degree its faculty of sense-perception and imagination. 
 - HoP 2",171.0
7223,"It therefore necessarily follows that in the soul also these different elements should be present. 
 - HoP 2",108.0
7225,"This understanding is absolute , uncompounded, and not influenced from without, as it is essentially activity. 
 - HoP 2",120.0
7226,"For the active is always more in honour than the passive, and the principle more in honour than the matter that it forms. 
 - HoP 2",131.0
7228,"Active understanding is not such that it sometimes thinks and sometimes does not. 
 - HoP 2",91.0
7229,"When it is absolute, it is the one and only existence; and this alone is eternal and immortal. 
 - HoP 2",104.0
7230,"We, however, do not remember this process, because this understanding is unaffected from without; but the passive understanding is transitory, and without the former it is incapable of thought. 
 - HoP 2",203.0
7231,"The seventh and eighth chapters are expositions of the maxims contained in the fourth and fifth; they begin with these maxims, and have the appearance of being from the hand of a commentator. 
 - HoP 2",201.0
7232,"The soul,  says Aristotle , is in a certain sense the whole of existence. 
 - HoP 2",83.0
7233,"For existent objects are either perceived by the senses or thought; but knowledge itself is in a manner the object of knowledge, and perception the object of perception. 
 - HoP 2",179.0
7234,"What are known and perceived are either the things themselves or their forms. 
 - HoP 2",87.0
7235,"Knowledge and sense-perception are not the things themselves , but their form; so that the soul is like the hand. 
 - HoP 2",123.0
7236,"As this is the instrument by which we grasp instruments, so the understanding is the form by which we apprehend forms, and sense-perception the form of the objects cf sense. 
 - HoP 2",183.0
7237,"Before this Aristotle had remarked : It has been truly said that the soul is the place of ideas : not the whole soul, but only the thinking soul, and these ideas do not exist in the soul actually, but only potentially. 
 - HoP 2",228.0
7238,"That is to say, the ideas are at first only quiescent forms, not activities, and so Aristotle is not a realist. 
 - HoP 2",121.0
7243,"Whether, however, it can think the absolute or not, unless it be itself separated from the sensuous, we shall inquire later. 
 - HoP 2",134.0
7244,"This later  Buhle considers to have reference to the highest philosophy. 
 - HoP 2",82.0
7245,"It is only in appearance that thought is spoken of as on a level with what is other than thought; this fashion of bringing what is different into conjunction certainly appears in Aristotle. 
 - HoP 2",199.0
7246,"But what he says of thought is explicitly and absolutely speculative, and is not on the same level with anything else, such as sense-perception, which has only potentiality for thought. 
 - HoP 2",195.0
7248,"These are the main points which are to be taken note of in Aristotle with regard to his speculative ideas, which it is impossible for us, however, to treat in greater detail. 
 - HoP 2",184.0
7250,"Aristotle  says: The object of knowledge and active knowledge are one and the same; what is in potentiality is in the individual prior in point of time, although not so in itself. 
 - HoP 2",189.0
7251,"For all that comes into being originates from that which operates actively. 
 - HoP 2",85.0
7252,"The object perceived by sense appears as that which causes the faculty of perception in potentiality to become the faculty of perception in actuality, for the latter is not receptive of influence, and does not undergo change. 
 - HoP 2",235.0
7253,"On that account it has a different kind of movement from the ordinary, for movement, as we have seen  is the activity of an unaccomplished end ; pure activity , on the contrary, is that of the accomplished end. 
 - HoP 2",220.0
7254,"Or if by mistake white has been stated to be not white, not-white has been brought into connection with it. 
 - HoP 2",117.0
7255,"All this process may, however, just as well be termed separation. 
 - HoP 2",75.0
7256,"But that which makes everything one is reason, which in the form of its thinking thinks the undivided in undivided time and with the undivided action of the soul. 
 - HoP 2",172.0
7257,"And to perceive the pleasant or unpleasant is to employ the activity   of the middle state of sense-perception upon good or evil, in so far as they are such. 
 - HoP 2",167.0
7258,"But desire and aversion are the same in energy; it is only in manifestation that they are different. 
 - HoP 2",110.0
7259,"To the reasoning soul pictorial conceptions take the place of sense-perceptions, and when the mind affirms or denies something to be good or bad, it desires or avoids its object. 
 - HoP 2",188.0
7260,"It has the relation both of unity and limit. 
 - HoP 2",54.0
7263,"But independently of action true and false are of the same character as good or evil. 
 - HoP 2",95.0
7264,"From this the conception of will, or the practical element is shown to us, and it has to be reckoned as still belonging to the Philosophy of Mind. 
 - HoP 2",156.0
7265,"Aristotle has treated it in several works which we now possess. 
 - HoP 2",73.0
7269,"Aristotle103 defines the principle of morality or the highest good, as happiness , which later on became a much disputed expression. 
 - HoP 2",142.0
7270,"It is good generally, not as abstract idea, but in such a way that the moment of realization is what actually answers to it. 
 - HoP 2",134.0
7271,"Aristotle thus does not content himself with the Platonic idea of the good, because it is only general; with him the question is taken in its determinateness. 
 - HoP 2",168.0
7272,"Aristotle then says that the good is what has its end in itself. 
 - HoP 2",74.0
7273,"If we tried to translate ÏÎ­Î»ÎµÎ¹Î¿Î½ by perfect  here, we should translate it badly; it is that which, as having its end  in itself, is not desired for the sake of anything else, but for its own sake. 
 - HoP 2",213.0
7274,"Aristotle determines happiness in this regard as the absolute end existing in and for itself, and gives the following definition of it: It is the energy of the life that has its end in itself in accordance with absolute virtue. 
 - HoP 2",237.0
7278,"In regard to the conception of virtue I should like to say something more. 
 - HoP 2",84.0
7279,"From a practical point of view, Aristotle104 first of all distinguishes in soul a rational and an irrational side; in the latter reason only exists potentially; under it come the feelings, passions and affections. 
 - HoP 2",223.0
7280,"On the rational side understanding, wisdom, discretion, knowledge, have their place; but they still do not constitute virtue, which first subsists in the unity of the rational and the irrational sides. 
 - HoP 2",211.0
7281,"When the inclinations are so related to virtue that they carry out its dictates, this, according to Aristotle, is virtue. 
 - HoP 2",131.0
7282,"When the perception is either bad or altogether lacking, but the heart is good, goodwill may be there, but not virtue, because the principle-that is reason-which is essential to virtue, is wanting. 
 - HoP 2",207.0
7284,"Hence it cannot be said of virtue that it is misemployed, for it itself is the employer. 
 - HoP 2",98.0
7285,"Thus Aristotle, as we have already seen , blames Socrates, because he places virtue in perception alone. 
 - HoP 2",114.0
7288,"But then the subject must, in this separation of his activity, bring likewise his passions under the subjection of the universal, and this unity, in which the rational is pre-eminent, is virtue. 
 - HoP 2",204.0
7291,"Aristotle then passes through the particular virtues at great length. 
 - HoP 2",79.0
7293,"This does not appear to be a sufficient definition, and it is merely a quantitative determination, just because it is not only the Notion that determines, but the empirical side is also present. 
 - HoP 2",204.0
7294,"Virtue is not absolutely determined in itself, but likewise has a material element, the nature of which is capable of a more or a less. 
 - HoP 2",145.0
7295,"Thus if it has been objected to Aristotles definition of virtue as a difference in degree, that it is unsatisfactory and vague, we may say that this really is involved in the nature of the thing. 
 - HoP 2",205.0
7296,"Virtue, and determinate virtue in its entirety, enters into a sphere where that which is quantitative has a place; thought here is no more as such at home with itself, and the quantitative limit undetermined. 
 - HoP 2",218.0
7297,"The nature of particular virtues is of such a kind, that they are capable of no more exact determination; they can only be spoken of in general, and for them there is no further determination than just this indefinite one. 
 - HoP 2",232.0
7298,"It is in practice that man seeks a necessity in man as individual, and endeavours to express it; but it is either formal, or as in particular virtues, a definite content, which, in so being, falls a prey to empiricism. 
 - HoP 2",228.0
7300,"Aristotle hence also looks on political philosophy as the sum total of practical philosophy, the end of the state as general happiness. 
 - HoP 2",145.0
7301,"All science and all capacity ,  he says , have an end, and this is the good: the more excellent they are, the more excellent is their end; but the most excellent capacity is the political, and hence its end is also the good. 
 - HoP 2",234.0
7302,"Of Ethics Aristotle recognizes that it indubitably also applies to the individual, though its perfection is attained in the nation as a whole. 
 - HoP 2",152.0
7304,"Such is the object of practical science, and this pertains in a measure to politics. 
 - HoP 2",94.0
7306,"There is also the sense of good and evil, &c, and Aristotle knows this aspect as well ; but that through which it is not animal sensation merely, is thought. 
 - HoP 2",167.0
7307,"Hence rational perception is also to Aristotle the essential condition of virtue, and thus the harmony between the sensational point of view and that of reason is an essential moment in his eudÃ¦monism. 
 - HoP 2",212.0
7309,"Aristotle does not place the individual and his rights first, but recognizes the state as what in its essence is higher than the individual and the family, for the very reason that it constitutes their substantiality. 
 - HoP 2",227.0
7310,"For the whole must be prior to its parts. 
 - HoP 2",51.0
7311,"If, for example, you take away the whole body, there is not a foot or hand remaining, excepting in name, and as if anyone should call a hand of stone a hand; for a hand destroyed is like a hand of stone.

7312,"If the man is dead, all the parts perish. 
 - HoP 2",51.0

 - HoP 2",198.0
7314,"The state is likewise the essence of the individuals; the individual when separate from the whole, is just as little complete in himself as any other organic part separated from the whole. 
 - HoP 2",198.0
7316,"But with Aristotle, as with Plato, the state is the prius, the substantial, the chief, for its end is the highest in respect of the practical. 
 - HoP 2",152.0
7317,"But whoever was incapable of this society, or so complete in himself as not to want it, would be either a beast or a god. 
 - HoP 2",131.0
7318,"From these few remarks it is clear that Aristotle could not have had any thought of a so-called natural right , that is, the idea of the abstract man outside of any actual relation to others.

7324,"We do not possess two separate words to mark this distinction.

7325,"The freedom of citizens in this signification is the dispensing with universality, the principle of isolation; but it is a necessary moment unknown to ancient states.

7326,"It is the perfect independence of the points, and therefore the greater independence of the whole, which constitutes the higher organic life. 
 - HoP 2",151.0
7327,"After the state received this principle into itself, the higher freedom could come forth. 
 - HoP 2",99.0
7329,"Aristotle for the rest has not tried like Plato to describe such a state, but in respect of the constitution he merely points out that the best must rule. 
 - HoP 2",164.0
7330,"But this always takes place, let men do as they will, and hence he has not so very much to do with determining the forms of the constitution. 
 - HoP 2",151.0
7332,"Here Alexander is no doubt in Aristotles mind, as one who must rule as though he were a god, and over whom no one, and not even law, could maintain its supremacy.

 - HoP 2",97.0
7341,"The forms he gives to us come from Aristotle both in reference to the Notion and to the judgment and conclusion.

7343,"Because it is a knowledge and consciousness of the abstract activity of pure understanding, it is not a knowledge of this and that concrete fact, being pure form.

 - HoP 2",193.0
7359,"Instead of subject we should do better to speak of substratum, for it is that to which the Notion necessarily relates, ie that which is neglected in abstraction, and thus the individual opposed to the Notion. 
 - HoP 2",218.0
7360,"We can see that Aristotle has the difference of the genus or universal and the individual present to his mind. 
 - HoP 2",120.0
7362,"In formal logic and its conceptions and definitions there is always present opposition to an actual; and the logical actual is in itself something thought, bravery thus being, for example, a pure form of abstraction. 
 - HoP 2",226.0
7363,"This logic of the understanding seeks, however, in its three stages to imitate the categories of the absolute. 
 - HoP 2",120.0
7364,"The conception or definition is a logical actual, and thus in itself merely something thought, ie possible. 
 - HoP 2",117.0
7365,"In the judgment this logic calls a conception A the actual subject and connects with it another actual as the conception B; B is said to be the conception and A to be dependent on it-but B is only the more general conception.

 - HoP 2",85.0
7369,"What comes second in Aristotle is the universal, which is not the genus, ie it is not in itself the unity of universal and particular-nor is it absolute individuality and hence infinitude. 
 - HoP 2",198.0
7370,"This is the moment or predicate in a subject certainly, but it is not absolutely in and for itself. 
 - HoP 2",109.0
7371,"This relation is now expressed through Î¿á½ Î»Î­Î³ÎµÏÎ±Î¹; for á½ Î»Î­Î³ÎµÏÎ±Î¹ is that which, as universal in itself, is likewise infinite. 
 - HoP 2",154.0
7372,"The third is the particular which is predicated: just as science in itself is infinite and thus the genus, eg of the grammatical art; but at the same time as universal, or as not individual, it is the moment of a subject. 
 - HoP 2",231.0
7373,"The fourth indicated by Aristotle is what is called immediate conception-the individual. 
 - HoP 2",98.0
7374,"The reservation that something such as a definite grammatical art is also in a subject, has no place here, for the definite grammatical art is not really in itself individual. 
 - HoP 2",185.0
7376,"This is the ordinary conclusion; from this we see, since this matter is so speedily despatched, that the real conclusion has with Aristotle a much greater significance.

7377,"The different genera not arranged under one another , such as animal and science, differ in their species. 
 - HoP 2",116.0
7378,"For instance, animals are divided into beasts, bird, fishes-but science has no such distinction. 
 - HoP 2",106.0
7379,"In subordinate genera, however, there may be the same distinctions; for the superior genera are predicated of the inferior, so that as many distinctions as there are of the predicate, so many will there be of the subject. 
 - HoP 2",231.0
7381,"That which is predicated without any connection he treats of more fully as the categories proper, in what follows; yet the work in which these categories are laid down is not to be regarded as complete. 
 - HoP 2",212.0
7382,"Aristotle112 takes ten of them; Each conception enunciated signifies either Substance , or Quality , or Quantity ,  matter, or Relation , or Where , or When , or Position , or Possession , or Action , or Passion. 
 - HoP 2",222.0
7383,"None of these is considered by itself an affirmation  or a negation , ie none is either true or false. 
 - HoP 2",112.0
7384,"Aristotle adds to these predicables five post predicaments, but he only ranges them all side by side. 
 - HoP 2",111.0
7385,"The categories of relation are the syntheses of quality and quantity, and consequently they belonged to reason; but in as far as they are posited as mere relation, they belong to the understanding and are forms of finitude. 
 - HoP 2",233.0
7386,"Being, essence, takes the first place in them; next to it is possibility, as accident or what is caused; the two are, however, separated. 
 - HoP 2",147.0
7387,"In substance A is Being, B, potentiality; in the relation of causality A and B are Being, but A is posited in B as being posited in a postulation of A. 
 - HoP 2",161.0
7388,"A of substance is logical Being; it is its essence opposed to its existence, and this existence is in logic mere potentiality. 
 - HoP 2",136.0
7389,"In the category of causality the Being of A in B is a mere Being of reflection; B is for itself another. 
 - HoP 2",114.0
7390,"But in reason A is the Being of B as well as of A, and A is the whole Being of A as well as of B. 
 - HoP 2",107.0
7391,"Aristotle114 goes on to speak of Substance; first Substance, in its strictest , first and chief sense  is to him the individual, the fourth class of the divisions enunciated above. 
 - HoP 2",190.0
7392,"Secondary substances are those in which as species  these first are contained, that is to say, both these and the genera of these species. 
 - HoP 2",148.0
7393,"Of the subject both name and definition  of all things predicated of a subject -of secondary substances-are predicated; for example of the particular man, as subject, both the name and the definition of man  are also predicated. 
 - HoP 2",238.0
7395,"All other things however,  besides Definition  and in most cases name, are related to primary substances as subjects  , or are inherent in them. 
 - HoP 2",154.0
7396,"Thus without the primary substances none of the rest could exist, for they are the basis  of all else. 
 - HoP 2",112.0
7397,"Of secondary substances, species is more substance than genus; for it is nearer to the primary substance, and genus is predicated of the species and not the other way. 
 - HoP 2",177.0
7398,"For species is here the subject, or what does not always require to be something really determined as individual, but which also signifies that which is generally speaking subordinate. 
 - HoP 2",194.0
7399,"But the species are not more substance one than another, just as in primary substances one is not more substance than the other. 
 - HoP 2",138.0
7400,"Species and genera are likewise, before the rest   to be called secondary substances: the definition man before the fact that he is white or runs. 
 - HoP 2",156.0
7402,"What is true of substances is also true of differences; for as synonyms  they have both name and definition in common. 
 - HoP 2",128.0
7403,"The second treatise is on Interpretation ; it is the doctrine of judgments and propositions. 
 - HoP 2",102.0

 - HoP 2",200.0
7405,"The Analytics come third, and there are two parts of them, the Prior and the Posterior; they deal most fully with proof  and the syllogisms of the understanding. 
 - HoP 2",171.0
7406,"The syllogism is a reason  in which if one thing is maintained, another than what was maintained follows of necessity. 
 - HoP 2",128.0
7408,"The Topics  which treat of places  come fourth; in them the points of view from which anything can be considered are enumerated. 
 - HoP 2",138.0
7409,"Cicero and Giordano Bruno worked this out more fully. 
 - HoP 2",63.0
7410,"Aristotle gives a large number of general points of view which can be taken of an object, a proposition or a problem; each problem can be directly reduced to these different points of view, that must everywhere appear. 
 - HoP 2",228.0
7412,"This, according to Aristotle, is the function of Dialectic, which he calls an instrument for finding propositions and conclusions out of probabilities. 
 - HoP 2",161.0
7414,"In the same way Aristotle separates120 the dialectic and demonstrative syllogisms from the rhetorical and every kind of persuasion, but he counts induction as belonging to what is rhetorical. 
 - HoP 2",201.0
7417,"Aristotle goes through a number of such contradictions by the way of solving them; in so doing he proceeds quietly and carefully, and spares no pains, though they might have been made more dramatic. 
 - HoP 2",208.0
7418,"We have before  found specimens of these in treating of the Megarics, and we have seen how Aristotle solves such contradictions through distinction and determination. 
 - HoP 2",176.0
7421,"Aristotle has rendered a never-ending service in having recognized and determined the forms which thought assumes within us. 
 - HoP 2",134.0
7423,"Even contemplation, or a knowledge of the numerous forms and modes assumed by this activity, is interesting and important enough. 
 - HoP 2",139.0
7432,"Thus by logicians they are held to be forms whose content is something entirely different, because they have not even the form of the content; and the meaning which is given to them-namely that they are forms-is found fault with. 
 - HoP 2",239.0
7438,"Thus they are only the material of truth, the formless content; their deficiency is hence not that they are only forms but rather that form is lacking to them, and that they are in too great a degree content. 
 - HoP 2",218.0
7441,"Now this content is none other than the speculative Idea. 
 - HoP 2",67.0
7443,"If they are thus in and for themselves true, they themselves are their own, and thus the highest content. 
 - HoP 2",115.0
7444,"But in ordinary logic this is not the case, and even as these are represented in the Aristotelian works they are only universal thought-determinations, between which the abstract understanding makes distinctions. 
 - HoP 2",222.0
7445,"This, however, is not the logic of speculative thought, ie of reason as distinguished from understanding; for there the identity of the understanding which allows nothing to contradict itself is fundamental. 
 - HoP 2",217.0
7446,"However little this logic of the finite may be speculative in nature, yet we must make ourselves acquainted with it, for it is everywhere discovered in finite relationships. 
 - HoP 2",183.0
7447,"There are many sciences, subjects of knowledge, &c, that know and apply no other forms of thought than these forms of finite thought, which constitute in fact the general method of dealing with the finite sciences. 
 - HoP 2",224.0
7448,"Mathematics, for instance, is a constant series of syllogisms; jurisprudence is the bringing of the particular under the general, the uniting together of both these sides. 
 - HoP 2",181.0
7450,"Aristotle is thus the originator of the logic of the understanding; its forms only concern the relationship of finite to finite, and in them the truth cannot be grasped. 
 - HoP 2",179.0
7451,"But it must be remarked that Aristotles philosophy is not by any means founded on this relationship of the understanding; thus it must not be thought that it is in accordance with these syllogisms that Aristotle has thought. 
 - HoP 2",234.0
7454,"Aristotle, in the Politics, for instance , often gives expression to this truth. 
 - HoP 2",90.0
7455,"For this reason the individual logical form has in itself no truth, not because it is the form of thought, but because it is determinate thought, individual form, and to be esteemed as such. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
7458,"But in this case logic is the science of reason, speculative philosophy of the pure Idea of absolute existence, which is not entangled in the opposition of subject and object, but remains an opposition in thought itself. 
 - HoP 2",230.0
7459,"Yet we certainly may allow that much in logic is an indifferent form. 
 - HoP 2",79.0
7460,"At this point we would leave off as far as the Aristotelian philosophy is concerned, and from this it is difficult to break away. 
 - HoP 2",139.0
7461,"For the further we go into its details, the more interesting it becomes, and the more do we find the connection which exists among the subjects. 
 - HoP 2",154.0
7463,"One of the immediate followers of Aristotle was Theophrastus, born Ol 102, 2 ; though a man of distinction, he can still only be esteemed a commentator on Aristotle. 
 - HoP 2",175.0
7466,"Thus of Theophrastus as of many others , amongst whom Strato of Lampsacus, the successor of Theophrastus, is best known, there is not much to tell. 
 - HoP 2",157.0
7468,"Cicero gives in an historical manner a result as he made it comprehensible to himself, without any speculative conception. 
 - HoP 2",132.0
7469,"StobÃ¦us , on the other hand, quotes from DicÃ¦archus that he held the soul to be a harmony of the four elements. 
 - HoP 2",123.0
7472,"At least, Cicero  relates of him that he maintained that divine strength lies altogether in nature, which has in itself the causes of origination, of growth, and of decay, but lacks all sensation and conformation. 
 - HoP 2",223.0
7473,"The other Peripatetics occupied themselves more with working up individual doctrines of Aristotle, with bringing out his works in a commentated form, which is more or less rhetorical in character, though similar in content. 
 - HoP 2",233.0
7474,"But in practical life the Peripatetic school maintained as the principle of happiness, the unity of reason and inclination. 
 - HoP 2",133.0
7478,"When in the Christian West science disappeared amongst the Christians, the fame of Aristotle shone forth with equal brilliance amongst the Arabians, from whom, in later times, his philosophy was again passed over to the West. 
 - HoP 2",235.0
7482,"The triumph over this system was thus a triumph over that principle, and consequently the triumph of free, spontaneous thought. 
 - HoP 2",137.0
7483,"But another side of this triumph is the triumph of the commonplace point of view that broke free from the Notion and shook off the yoke of thought. 
 - HoP 2",157.0
7485,"In science, too, in place of subtle thoughts, subtle sight has commenced; a beetle or a species of bird is distinguished with as great minuteness as were formerly conceptions and thoughts. 
 - HoP 2",198.0
7488,"What now appears is that the unity of the Notion which is absolute existence, makes its appearance as necessity, and it presents itself first as the unity of self-consciousness and consciousness, as pure thought. 
 - HoP 2",222.0
7489,"The unity of existence as existence is objective unity, thought, as that which is thought. 
 - HoP 2",100.0
7490,"But unity, as Notion, the implicitly universal negative unity, time as absolutely fulfilled time, and in its fulfilment as being unity, is pure self-consciousness. 
 - HoP 2",173.0
7492,"Here we have concluded the first division of Greek philosophy, and we have now to pass to the second period. 
 - HoP 2",118.0
7493,"The first period of Greek philosophy extended to Aristotle, to the attainment of a scientific form in which knowledge has reached the standing of free thought. 
 - HoP 2",169.0
7495,"The next essential, one which now is immediately before us, must be contained in that into which Philosophy under Plato and Aristotle had formed itself. 
 - HoP 2",162.0
7497,"We may speak of the Platonic and Aristotelian systems, but they are not in the form of a system; for that it is requisite that one principle should be maintained and consistently carried through the particular. 
 - HoP 2",220.0
7500,"Aristotles logic is really the opposite of this. 
 - HoP 2",58.0
7502,"If even Plato on the whole proceeded in an empiric way, taking up this and that idea, each of which is in turn examined, with Aristotle this loose method of procedure appears still more clearly. 
 - HoP 2",204.0
7504,"The highest Idea with Aristotle consequently once more stands only as a particular in its own place and without being the principle of his whole philosophy. 
 - HoP 2",166.0
7506,"This is the standpoint which we find in this second period. 
 - HoP 2",69.0
7507,"A systematic philosophy such as this becomes in the first place dogmatism, in antagonism to which, because of its one-sided character, scepticism immediately arises. 
 - HoP 2",175.0
7508,"In the same way the French call what is dogmatic systÃ©matique, and systÃ¨me that in which all the conceptions must consistently proceed from one determination; hence to them systÃ©matique is synonymous with one-sided. 
 - HoP 2",228.0
7510,"Hence this principle stands up formally and abstractly, and the particular is not yet deduced from it, for the universal is only applied to the particular and the rules for this application sought out. 
 - HoP 2",211.0
7511,"In Aristotle the Idea is at least implicitly concrete, as the consciousness of the unity of subjective and objective, and therefore it is not one-sided. 
 - HoP 2",162.0
7512,"Should the Idea be truly concrete, the particular must be developed from it. 
 - HoP 2",86.0
7514,"But the true difficulty is that the two endeavours, the development of the particular from the Idea, and the bringing of the particular under the universal, collide with one another. 
 - HoP 2",192.0
7515,"The manifestations of the physical and spiritual world must first, from their respective sides, be prepared for and worked into the Notion, so that the other sciences can form therefrom universal laws and principles. 
 - HoP 2",226.0
7516,"Then for the first time can speculative reason present itself in determinate thoughts, and bring perfectly to consciousness the inwardly existing connection between them. 
 - HoP 2",180.0
7517,"As dogmatic, however, those philosophies, it may be further said, are assertive likewise, because in such a method the principle is only asserted and is not truly proved. 
 - HoP 2",180.0
7518,"For a principle is demanded under which everything is subsumed; thus it is only pre-supposed as the first principle. 
 - HoP 2",126.0
7519,"Before this we have had abstract principles such as pure Being, but here the particular, with which begins the distinction from what is different, became posited as the purely negative. 
 - HoP 2",195.0
7520,"That necessity, on the other hand, makes for a universal which must likewise be in the particular, so that this should not be set aside, but should have its determinate character through the universal. 
 - HoP 2",211.0
7521,"This demand for a universal, even though still unproved principle, is henceforth present to knowledge. 
 - HoP 2",112.0
7522,"What answers to this demand now appears in the world through the inward necessity of mind-not externally, but as being in conformity with the Notion. 
 - HoP 2",159.0
7523,"This necessity has produced the philosophy of the Stoics, Epicureans, New Academy, and Sceptics, which we have now to consider. 
 - HoP 2",137.0
7524,"If we have remained too long in the consideration of this period, we may now make amends for this protraction, for in the next period we may be brief. 
 - HoP 2",160.0
7526,"Along with this last we would take the New Academy, which has entirely merged in it-while in the Older Academy, Platos philosophy indubitably still maintained its purity. 
 - HoP 2",180.0
7528,"The application of universal to particular is here the relationship that prevails, for the reflection that from the universal itself the separation of the totality is developed, is not yet present. 
 - HoP 2",207.0
7530,"Now since this is what we have in so-called Dogmatism, it is a philosophizing of the understanding, in which Platos and Aristotles speculative greatness is no longer present. 
 - HoP 2",184.0
7531,"In respect of this relationship, the task of Philosophy now comes to be summed up in the twofold question which we spoke of earlier , and which has regard to a criterion of truth and to the wise man. 
 - HoP 2",209.0
7532,"At this point we may better than before, and also from a different point of view, explain the necessity for this phenomenon. 
 - HoP 2",134.0
7534,"Yet because this question had only been formally and dogmatically answered, the dialectic of Scepticism, or the knowledge of the one-sidedness of this principle as a dogmatic principle, at once appeared. 
 - HoP 2",213.0
7535,"A further result of this mode of philosophizing is that the principle, as formal, is subjective, and consequently it has taken the real significance of the subjectivity of self-consciousness. 
 - HoP 2",201.0
7536,"Because of the external manner in which the manifold is received, the highest point, that in which thought finds itself in its most determinate form, is self-consciousness. 
 - HoP 2",182.0
7538,"Nature and the political world are certainly also concrete, but externally concrete; the arbitrary concrete is, on the other hand, not in the determinate universal Idea, but only in self-consciousness and as being personal. 
 - HoP 2",233.0
7539,"The second ruling determination is consequently that of the wise men. 
 - HoP 2",79.0
7541,"The thought of the criterion as of the one principle is, in its immediate actuality, the subject itself; thought and the thinker are thus immediately connected. 
 - HoP 2",170.0
7542,"Because the principle of this philosophy is not objective but dogmatic, and rests on the impulse of self-consciousness towards self-satisfaction, it is the subject whose interests are to be considered. 
 - HoP 2",211.0
7544,"Self-consciousness lives in the solitude of its thought, and finds therein its satisfaction. 
 - HoP 2",102.0
7545,"These are the fundamental determinations in the following philosophies: the exposition of their main principles will come next, but to go into details is not advisable. 
 - HoP 2",178.0
7547,"In the bright Grecian world the individual attached himself more to his state or to his world, and was more at home in it. 
 - HoP 2",132.0
7548,"The concrete morality, the impulse towards the introduction of the principle into the world through the constitution of the state, which we see in Plato, the concrete science that we find in Aristotle, here disappear. 
 - HoP 2",227.0
7549,"In the wave of adversity which came across the Roman world, everything beautiful and noble in spiritual individuality was rudely swept away. 
 - HoP 2",150.0
7550,"In this condition of disunion in the world, when man is driven within his inmost self, he has to seek the unity and satisfaction, no longer to be found in the world, in an abstract way. 
 - HoP 2",195.0
7551,"The Roman world is thus the world of abstraction, where one cold rule was extended over all the civilized world. 
 - HoP 2",122.0
7552,"The living individualities of national spirit in the nations have been stifled and killed; a foreign power, as an abstract universal, has pressed hard upon individuals. 
 - HoP 2",178.0
7553,"In such a condition of dismemberment it was necessary to fly to this abstraction as to the thought of an existent subject, that is, to this inward freedom of the subject as such. 
 - HoP 2",188.0
7554,"As what was held in estimation was the abstract will of the individual ruler of the world, the inward principle of thought also had to be an abstraction which could bring forth a formal, subjective reconciliation only. 
 - HoP 2",228.0
7555,"A dogmatism erected on a principle made effectual through the form of the understanding could alone satisfy the Roman mind. 
 - HoP 2",133.0
7556,"These philosophies are thus conformable to the spirit of the Roman world, as indeed Philosophy in general ever stands in close connection with the world in its ordinary aspect. 
 - HoP 2",186.0
7558,"These philosophies, always excepting Stoicism, also arose amongst the Romans in opposition to their ancient superstitions, just as now Philosophy comes forward in the place of religion. 
 - HoP 2",195.0
7560,"There is opposed to thought, in the second place, the determinate as such, the principle of individuality, feeling generally, sensuous perception and observation. 
 - HoP 2",172.0
7561,"These two form the principles of the Stoic and Epicurean philosophies. 
 - HoP 2",80.0
7563,"Besides Stoicism and Epicureanism, there is, in the third place, Scepticism, the negation of these two one-sided philosophies which must be recognized as such. 
 - HoP 2",169.0
7565,"Thus the next result arrived at is that nothing can be known. 
 - HoP 2",71.0
7566,"Yet the imperturbability and uniformity of mind in itself, which suffers through nothing, and which is affected neither by enjoyment, pain, nor any other bond, is the common standpoint and the common end of all these philosophies. 
 - HoP 2",240.0
7567,"Thus however gloomy men may consider Scepticism, and however low a view they take of Epicureanism, all these have in this way been philosophies. 
 - HoP 2",154.0

 - HoP 2",155.0

 - HoP 2",134.0
7579,"The founder of the Stoic School is Zeno ; he belonged to Cittium, a town in Cyprus, and was born about the 109th Olympiad. 
 - HoP 2",132.0
7581,"Zeno himself travelled to Athens, and, according to some, he found a further motive to live for Philosophy, in that he lost all his possessions by a shipwreck. 
 - HoP 2",169.0
7582,"What he did not lose was the cultured nobility of his mind and his love of rational understanding. 
 - HoP 2",108.0
7583,"Zeno visited several sections of the Socratics, and particularly Xenocrates, a man belonging to the Platonic School, who, on account of the strictness of his morality and the austerity of his whole demeanour, was very celebrated. 
 - HoP 2",239.0
7584,"Thus he underwent the same ordeals as those to which the holy Francis of Assisi subjected himself, and succumbed to them just as little. 
 - HoP 2",146.0
7586,"Then Zeno also visited Stilpo, a Megaric, whom we already know about , and with whom he studied dialectic for ten years. 
 - HoP 2",130.0
7587,"Philosophy was considered as the business of his life, and of his whole life, and not studied as it is by a student who hurries through his lectures on Philosophy in order to hasten on to something else. 
 - HoP 2",213.0
7589,"From this his school received the name of Stoic. 
 - HoP 2",58.0
7590,"Like Aristotle his principal endeavour was to unite Philosophy into one whole. 
 - HoP 2",88.0
7592,"Hence with less vanity his temperance in the satisfaction of his absolute wants was almost as great, for he lived on nothing but water, bread, figs and honey.

 - HoP 2",120.0
7701,"Ordinary conception on its own account  is an impression , and for it Chrysippus used the expression alteration. 
 - HoP 2",122.0
7703,"According to Ciceros account , Zeno illustrated the moments of this appropriation by a movement of the hand. 
 - HoP 2",118.0
7705,"This double pressure, my pressing with the other hand that which is grasped, is said to signify conviction, my being conscious of the identity of thought with the content.

 - HoP 2",84.0
7708,"The first action, the open hand, is sensuous apprehension, immediate seeing, hearing, &c; the first motion of the hand is then, speaking generally, spontaneity in grasping. 
 - HoP 2",182.0
7709,"This first assent is likewise given by fools; it is weak, and may be false. 
 - HoP 2",85.0
7710,"The next moment is the closing of the hand, comprehension, taking something in; this makes the ordinary conception truth, because the ordinary conception becomes identical with thought. 
 - HoP 2",195.0
7713,"But in scientific knowledge a perception of the first elements and determinate knowledge through thought of the object is contained. 
 - HoP 2",142.0
7714,"Thus the ordinary conception as apprehended is thought; scientific knowledge is the consciousness of thought, the knowledge of that harmony. 
 - HoP 2",150.0
7715,"We may also give our assent to these conclusions of the Stoics with their various stages, since in them there is a perception which is undoubtedly true. 
 - HoP 2",162.0
7717,"Now this would be consciousness itself, but what this last can compare is nothing more than its conception, and-not the object, but-its conception again. 
 - HoP 2",163.0
7718,"Consciousness thus really accepts the conception of the object; it is by this approbation that the conception actually receives truth-the testimony of mind to the objective rationality of the world. 
 - HoP 2",208.0
7721,"In this, say the Stoics, the truth is contained; it is an object which is likewise thought, so that the thought that gives its assent is the ruling thought which posits the harmony of subject with content. 
 - HoP 2",215.0
7722,"The fact that anything is or has truth is thus not because it is , but the fact that it is, has its power in the approbation of consciousness. 
 - HoP 2",152.0
7723,"But this thought alone and for itself is not the truth, nor is the truth as such contained in it, for the Notion requires the objective element and is only the rational consciousness respecting the truth. 
 - HoP 2",214.0
7727,"Thus neither is immediate thought the true, excepting in so far us it corresponds to the Notion and is known through the working out of rational thought. 
 - HoP 2",163.0
7728,"This general idea is the only one which is interesting in the Stoics, but even in this very principle, limitations are found to be present. 
 - HoP 2",149.0
7729,"It merely expresses the truth as subsisting in the object, as thought of, yet for that very reason it is still a very formal determination, or not in itself the real Idea. 
 - HoP 2",181.0
7730,"From this point of view Sextus Empiricus  examines the Stoics, and he considers and discusses them in all sorts of ways. 
 - HoP 2",130.0
7731,"The most striking thing that he says is what relates to the following. 
 - HoP 2",80.0
7732,"The fact that anything is, rests in its being thought-the fact that it is thought in something being there; the one is the pre-supposition of the other. 
 - HoP 2",162.0
7733,"That is to say, the Stoics assert that a thing exists, not because it is, but through thought; but consciousness for its existence requires another, for thought is likewise one-sided. 
 - HoP 2",193.0
7734,"In this criticism by Sextus it is indicated that thought requires an object as an external to which it gives its approbation. 
 - HoP 2",135.0
7735,"There can be no talk of its being here indicated that the thinking mind in order to exist as consciousness does not require the object; this is really inherent in its conception. 
 - HoP 2",188.0
7736,"But the this  of the object as an external is only a moment which is not the only one or the essential. 
 - HoP 2",113.0
7738,"But likewise, having gone into itself, it has now from itself to beget its object and give itself the content which it sends forth from itself. 
 - HoP 2",153.0
7739,"Stoicism is only this return of mind into itself, positing the unity of itself and the object, and recognizing the harmony; but not the going forth again to the extension of the real knowledge of a content from itself. 
 - HoP 2",228.0
7742,"For if thought predominates, still it is always universal form alone. 
 - HoP 2",79.0
7743,"On account of this universality thought yields nothing but the form of identity with itself; the ultimate criterion is thus only the formal identity of the thought which discovers harmony. 
 - HoP 2",198.0
7744,"But it may be asked, with what? For there no absolute self-determination, no content that proceeds from thought as such is to be found; and hence everything may harmonize with my thought. 
 - HoP 2",197.0
7745,"The criterion of the Stoics is consequently only the principle of contradiction; yet when we remove the contradiction from absolute reality, it is indeed self-identical, but for that very reason empty. 
 - HoP 2",211.0
7746,"The harmony must be a higher one; there must be harmony with self in what is other than self, in content, in determination; and thus it must be harmony with harmony. 
 - HoP 2",175.0
7747,"In accordance with this recognition of the principle of the Stoics, both their logic and their morality is judged; neither the one nor the other arrives at being immanent free science. 
 - HoP 2",194.0
7748,"We have already remarked  that they also occupied themselves with logical definitions, and since they made abstract thought the principle, they have brought formal logic to great perfection. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
7750,"Then along with this comes in, for the first time, the question respecting the harmony of thought and object or the demand that an appropriate content of thought be shown. 
 - HoP 2",181.0
7754,"Hence Scepticism cast up this opposition more especially to the Stoics, and the Stoics amongst themselves had always to improve on their conceptions. 
 - HoP 2",159.0
7755,"As we have just seen  in Sextus Empiricus, they did not quite know whether they should define conception as impression or alteration, or in some other way. 
 - HoP 2",165.0
7756,"Now if this conception is admitted into that which directs the soul, into pure consciousness, Sextus further asks , How can an alteration, an impression, be made on this? Then the thought-forms are themselves incorporeal. 
 - HoP 2",231.0
7757,"But, according to the Stoics, only the corporeal can make an impression or bring about an alteration. 
 - HoP 2",111.0
7758,"That is to say, on the one hand, because corporeal and incorporeal are unlike they cannot be one; and, on the other, incorporeal thought-forms, as capable of no alteration, are not the content, for this last is the corporeal only. 
 - HoP 2",240.0
7759,"If the thought-forms could in fact have attained the form of content, they would have been a content of thought in itself. 
 - HoP 2",132.0
7760,"But as they were they had value as laws of thought 135 merely. 
 - HoP 2",72.0
7762,"But this development took a very formal direction; there are the ordinary well-known forms of inference, five of which are given by Chrysippus, while others give sometimes more and sometimes fewer. 
 - HoP 2",207.0
7763,"One of them is the hypothetical syllogism through remotion, When it is day it is light, but now it is night and hence it is not light. 
 - HoP 2",144.0
7764,"These logical forms of thought are by the Stoics held to be the unproved that requires no proof; but they are likewise only formal forms which determine no content as such. 
 - HoP 2",182.0
7765,"The wise man is specially skilful in dialectic, we are told by the Stoics, for all things, both physical and ethical, are perceived through a knowledge of logic. 
 - HoP 2",171.0
7766,"But thus they have ascribed this perception to a subject, without stating who this wise man is. 
 - HoP 2",105.0
7768,"It would be superfluous to speak further of their logic any more than of their theory of judgments, which in part coincides with it, and in part is a grammar and a rhetoric; by it no real scientific content can be reached. 
 - HoP 2",232.0
7770,"This logical element, whose essence consists pre-eminently in escaping to the simplicity of the conception to that which is not in opposition to itself nor falls into contradiction, obtains the upper hand. 
 - HoP 2",215.0
7771,"This simplicity, which has not negativity and content in itself, requires a given content which it may not abrogate-but consequently it cannot thus attain to a genuine other  through itself. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
7772,"The Stoics have constituted their logic often in the most isolated fashion; the principal point that is established here is that the objective corresponds to thought, and they investigated this thought more closely. 
 - HoP 2",225.0
7774,"This is the point of view most important in the philosophy of the Stoics; it thus showed itself in their physics also. 
 - HoP 2",128.0
7777,"For according to him the Stoics say: The first desire  of the animal is for self-preservation, because nature from the beginning reconciled each existence with itself. 
 - HoP 2",177.0
7778,"This first object innate in every animal   is thus the harmony of the animal with itself, and the consciousness of the same,  the self-consciousness through which the animal is not alienated from itself. 
 - HoP 2",213.0
7779,"Thus it repels what is injurious and accepts what is serviceable to it. 
 - HoP 2",81.0
7780,"This is Aristotles conception of the nature of adaptation to an end, in which, as the principle of activity, both the opposite and its sublation are contained. 
 - HoP 2",169.0
7781,"Enjoyment is not the first object, for it   is only for the first time added when the nature of an animal that seeks itself through itself, receives into itself that which is in conformity with its harmony with itself. 
 - HoP 2",228.0
7783,"The case is similar in regard to man; his end is self-preservation, but with a conscious end, with consideration, according to reason. 
 - HoP 2",144.0
7784,"In plants nature operates without voluntary inclination  or sense-perception, but some things in us take place in the same manner as in plants. 
 - HoP 2",153.0

 - HoP 2",150.0
7788,"To live in accordance with nature is thus, to the Stoics, to live rationally. 
 - HoP 2",87.0
7789,"This now appears somewhat like certain receipts given by the Stoics for the purpose of discovering right motive forces in regard to virtue. 
 - HoP 2",149.0
7790,"For their principle put generally is this: Men must live in conformity with nature, ie with virtue; for to it   nature leads us. 
 - HoP 2",138.0
7791,"That is the highest good, the end of everything-a most important form in Stoic morality, which appears in Cicero as finis bonorum or summum bonum. 
 - HoP 2",156.0
7792,"With the Stoics right reason and the securing of it on its own account, is the highest principle. 
 - HoP 2",107.0

7818,"Thus the question was raised as to how virtue and happiness are related to one another, a theme of which the Epicureans have also treated. 
 - HoP 2",148.0
7819,"Here it was, as in more recent times, regarded as the great problem to discover whether virtue gives happiness, taken altogether by itself, whether the conception of happiness is included in its conception. 
 - HoP 2",216.0
7820,"That union of virtue and happiness, as the mean, is thus rightly represented as being perfect, neither pertaining only to self-consciousness nor to externality. 
 - HoP 2",170.0
7821,"In order to be able to give a general answer to this question, we most recollect what was said above of the principle of self-preservation, according to which virtue has to do with the rational nature.

7822,"The fulfilment of its end is happiness as finding itself realized, and as the knowledge or intuitive perception of itself as an external-a harmony of its Notion or its genius with its Being or its reality. 
 - HoP 2",215.0
7824,"This rests in the conception of action and particularly of good action. 
 - HoP 2",81.0
7825,"For the bad destroys reality and is opposed to self-preservation; but the good is what makes for its self-preservation and effectuates it-the good end is thus the content that realizes itself in action. 
 - HoP 2",212.0
7827,"The distinction rests in the fact that the Stoics have merely remained at this general conception, and set it forth immediately as actuality; in it however, the conception of virtuous action is merely expressed, and not reality. 
 - HoP 2",238.0
7828,"A further point is that just because the Stoics have remained at this position, the opposition between virtue and happiness immediately enters in, or, in abstract form, that between thought and its determination.

 - HoP 2",157.0
7835,"Such at once show themselves, however, to be merely contingent and external; hence we soon get past this standpoint in the problem, and thus external enjoyment, riches, noble birth, &c, do not accord with virtue or happiness. 
 - HoP 2",235.0
7837,"Thus these may be the concomitants of virtue, although it is a matter of indifference whether they are so or not, for since this satisfaction is not end, it is equally a matter of indifference if pain is the concomitant of virtue.

7854,"The old question, which at this time again came up, thus concerns the harmony between virtue and happiness. 
 - HoP 2",117.0
7855,"We speak of morality rather than virtue, because that according to which I ought to direct my actions is not, as in virtue, my will, as it has become custom. 
 - HoP 2",167.0
7856,"Morality really contains my subjective conviction that that which I do is in conformity with rational determinations of will, with universal duties. 
 - HoP 2",158.0
7857,"That question is a necessary one, a problem which even in Kants time occupied men, and in endeavouring to solve it we must begin by considering what is to be understood by happiness. 
 - HoP 2",192.0

7864,"Yet this enjoyment ever remains a secondary matter, a consequence, which in so far as it is so cannot be made end, but should only be considered as an accessory. 
 - HoP 2",171.0
7865,"The Stoics said in this regard that virtue is alone to be sought, but with virtue happiness on its own account is found, for it confers blessing explicitly as such. 
 - HoP 2",174.0
7867,"The Stoics have been laughed at because they said that pain is no evil. 
 - HoP 2",81.0
7868,"But toothache and the like are not in question as regards this problem. 
 - HoP 2",81.0
7869,"We cannot but know we are subject to such; pain like this, and unhappiness are, however, two different things. 
 - HoP 2",120.0
7870,"Thus the problem throughout is only to be understood as the demand for a harmony of the rational will with external reality. 
 - HoP 2",134.0
7871,"To this reality there also belongs the sphere of particular existence, of subjectivity, of personality, of particular interests.

 - HoP 2",105.0
7875,"Another opposition is that within virtue itself. 
 - HoP 2",58.0
7877,"Because virtue is thus that which is conformable to the real essence or law of things, in a general sense the Stoics called virtue everything, in every department, which is in conformity with law in that department. 
 - HoP 2",225.0
7879,"But this is only a kind of quibbling such as we have also seen in Ciceros case. 
 - HoP 2",89.0
7882,"Although much that is elevated and edifying may find its support here, an actual determination is still wanting; hence there is according to the Stoics only one virtue,142 and the wise man is the virtuous. 
 - HoP 2",215.0
7885,"For if the Stoics had gone beyond the mere conception of action for the implicitly existent end, and had reached to the knowledge of the content, they would not have required to express this as a subject. 
 - HoP 2",214.0
7886,"To them rational self-preservation is virtue. 
 - HoP 2",55.0
7887,"But if we ask what it is that is evolved by virtue, the answer is to the effect that it is just rational self-preservation; and thus they have not by this expression got beyond that formal circle.

7888,"Moral reality is not expressed as that which is enduring, which is evolved and ever evolving itself.

 - HoP 2",64.0
7891,"Or we may understand this thus.

7892,"Their moral reality is only the wise man, an ideal and not a reality-in fact the mere conception whose reality is not set forth. 
 - HoP 2",138.0
7893,"This subjectivity is already contained in the fact that moral reality, expressed as virtue, thereby immediately presents the appearance of being present only as a quality of the individual. 
 - HoP 2",199.0
7895,"For this happiness would be just the enjoyment of the individual as the harmony of existence with him as individual; but with him as individual true happiness does not harmonize, but only with him as universal man. 
 - HoP 2",224.0
7898,"Stoic self-consciousness has not here to deal with its individuality as such, but solely with the freedom in which it is conscious of itself only as the universal.

7899,"Now could one call this happiness, in distinction to the other, true happiness, happiness would still, on the whole, remain a wrong expression. 
 - HoP 2",153.0
7901,"But this differentiated consciousness is not present in that self-satisfaction; for in that freedom the individual has rather the sense of his universality only.

7906,"But no further notice or speech about this is requisite, nor are we to imagine that there is much that is rational and important within it. 
 - HoP 2",149.0
7907,"But the Stoic consciousness does not get beyond this individuality to the reality of the universal, and therefore it has only to express the form, the real as an individual, or the wise man. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
7911,"All is merged into this: the simplicity of the Notion, or its pure negativity, is posited in relation to everything. 
 - HoP 2",126.0
7912,"But the real filling in, the objective mode, is wanting, and in order to enter into this, Stoicism requires that the content should be given. 
 - HoP 2",151.0
7913,"Hence the Stoics depicted the ideal of the wise man in specially eloquent terms, telling how perfectly sufficient in himself and independent he is, for what the wise man does is right. 
 - HoP 2",194.0
7914,"The description of the ideal formed by the Stoics is hence a common subject of discussion and is even devoid of interest; or at least the negative element in it is alone noteworthy. 
 - HoP 2",191.0
7915,"The wise man is free and likewise in chains, for he acts from himself, uncorrupted by fear or desire. 
 - HoP 2",111.0
7916,"Everything which belongs to desire and fear he does not reckon to himself, he gives to such the position of being something foreign to him; for no particular existence is secure to him.

7917,"The wise man is alone king, for he alone is not bound to laws, and he is debtor to no one. 
 - HoP 2",100.0
7920,"Similarly the wise man may eat human flesh,143 &c But a universal reason is something quite indeterminate. 
 - HoP 2",116.0
7922,"The Stoic wise man is thus also enlightened, in the sense that where he did not know how to bring the natural instinct into the form of a rational reason, he trampled upon nature. 
 - HoP 2",189.0
7923,"Thus that which is called natural law or natural instinct comes into opposition with what is set forth as immediately and universally rational. 
 - HoP 2",153.0
7925,"But should the wise man hence not be bound by the former because it is not something immediately thought, this is merely the fault of his want of comprehension. 
 - HoP 2",170.0
7928,"But this is so for the reason that it only seeks out and knows the most immediate grounds and cannot know whether there are not other aspects and other grounds. 
 - HoP 2",170.0
7931,"They draw deductions from facts, connections, consequences, from a contradiction or opposition; and this Antoninus and Seneca do in an edifying way and with great ingenuity. 
 - HoP 2",183.0
7933,"Hence reasons are as a whole subjective. 
 - HoP 2",50.0

 - HoP 2",69.0
7936,"They do not constitute the thing, the objective itself, but the thing of my own will, of my desire, a bauble through which I set up before me the nobility of my mind; the opposite of this is self-oblivion in the thing. 
 - HoP 2",228.0
7938,"This reasoning is often brilliant, as with Seneca: we find much that awakens and strengthens the mind, clever antitheses and rhetoric, but we likewise feel the coldness and tediousness of these moral discourses. 
 - HoP 2",221.0
7939,"We are stimulated but not often satisfied, and this may be deemed the character of sophistry: if acuteness in forming distinctions and sincere opinion must be there recognized, yet final conviction is ever lacking. 
 - HoP 2",224.0
7941,"The happy life,  says Seneca , is unalterably grounded on a right and secure judgment. 
 - HoP 2",96.0
7943,"Because the moral principle of the Stoics remains at this formalism, all that they treat of is comprised in this.

7946,"The Stoic principle is a necessary moment in the Idea of absolute consciousness; it is also a necessary manifestation in time. 
 - HoP 2",136.0
7947,"For if, as in the Roman world, the life of the real mind is lost in the abstract universal; the consciousness, where real universality is destroyed, must go back into its individuality and maintain itself in its thoughts.

7949,"It is thus herein implied, not that the condition of the world is a rational and right one, but only that the subject as such should assert his freedom in himself. 
 - HoP 2",173.0
7954,"It is something much higher when the inward principle of the mind, of the rational will, likewise realizes itself, so that there arises a rational constitution, a condition of things in accordance with culture and law. 
 - HoP 2",228.0
7955,"Through such objectivity of reason, the determinations which come together in the ideal of the wise man are first consolidated. 
 - HoP 2",137.0
7956,"There then is present a system of moral relationships which are duties; each determination is then in its place, the one subordinated to the other, and the higher is predominant. 
 - HoP 2",188.0
7958,"Because these duties do not merely appear to hold good in a general sense, but are also recognized in my conscience as having the character of the universal, the harmony of the rational will and reality is established.

 - HoP 2",66.0

8078,"If this negative is also again, as soul, affirmative, Epicurus in the notional determination of thinking has only reached this negativity, that we look away from something, ie we interrupt that inflowing stream. 
 - HoP 2",221.0
8080,"This constitutes on the whole the metaphysic of Epicurus; in it he has expounded his doctrine of the atom, but not with greater definiteness than did Leucippus and Democritus. 
 - HoP 2",185.0

8099,"That interruption, which we regarded above  as the other side to atoms, or as vacuum, is the principle of movement: for the movement of thought is also like this and has interruptions. 
 - HoP 2",194.0
8101,"The movement of thinking is thus the province of the atoms of the soul; so that there takes place simultaneously therein an interruption of the inward flow of atoms from without.

8102,"There is therefore nothing further to be seen in this than the general principle of the positive and negative, so that even thought is affected by a negative principle, the moment of interruption. 
 - HoP 2",206.0
8103,"This principle of the Epicurean system, further applied to the difference in things, is the most arbitrary and therefore the most wearisome that can be imagined. 
 - HoP 2",171.0
8105,"That is to say, Epicurus ascribes to atoms a curvilinear movement, in order that they may impinge on one another and so on.

 - HoP 2",215.0
8109,"The transition to bodies of concrete appearance Epicurus has either not made at all, or what has been cited from him as far as this matter is concerned, taken by itself, is extremely meagre. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
8110,"The opinion that one hears expressed respecting the Epicurean philosophy is in other respects not unfavourable; and for this reason some further details must be given regarding it. 
 - HoP 2",190.0
8111,"For since absolute Being is constituted by atoms scattered and disintegrated, and by vacuum, it directly follows that Epicurus denies to these atoms any relationship to one another which implies purpose. 
 - HoP 2",213.0
8113,"Or else Epicurus altogether denies that Notion and the Universal are the essential, and because all originations are to him chance combinations, for him their resolution is just as much a matter of chance. 
 - HoP 2",215.0
8114,"The divided is the first and the truly existent, but at the same time chance or external necessity is the law which dominates all cohesion. 
 - HoP 2",149.0
8116,"In contrast to this, the teleological view enters largely into the philosophy of the Stoics, and is there very fully developed. 
 - HoP 2",137.0
8117,"To show that conformity to an end is lacking, Epicurus brings forward the most trivial examples; for instance, that worms and so on are produced by chance from mud through the warmth of the sun. 
 - HoP 2",204.0
8118,"Taken in their entirety, they may very well be the work of chance in relation to others; but what is implicit in them, their Notion and essence is something organic: and the comprehension of this is what we have now to consider. 
 - HoP 2",238.0
8120,"The Stoics take the opposite course of finding essential Being in the object of thought or the universal; and they fail equally in reaching the content, temporal existence, which, however, they most inconsistently assume. 
 - HoP 2",231.0
8121,"We have here the metaphysics of Epicurus; nothing that he says farther on this head is of interest. 
 - HoP 2",109.0
8123,"Going further, the principle of the manner in which Epicurus looks on nature, lies in the conceptions he forms, which we have already had before us. 
 - HoP 2",158.0
8125,"In this way it comes about that by such images we can apprehend the unknown which does not lend itself immediately to perception; for from what is known we must argue to what is unknown. 
 - HoP 2",196.0
8126,"This is nothing else but saying that Epicurus judged by analogy, or that he makes so-called evidence the principle of his view of Nature; and this is the principle which to this day has authority in ordinary physical science. 
 - HoP 2",235.0
8127,"We go through experiences and make observations, these arising from the sensuous perceptions which are apt to be overlooked. 
 - HoP 2",134.0
8128,"Thus we reach general concepts, laws, forces, and so on, electricity and magnetism, for instance, and these are then applied by us to such objects and activities as we cannot ourselves directly perceive. 
 - HoP 2",213.0
8129,"As an example, we know about the nerves and their connection with the brain; in order that there may be feeling and so on, it is said that a transmission from the finger-tips to the brain takes place. 
 - HoP 2",210.0
8130,"But how can we represent this to ourselves? We cannot make it a matter of observation. 
 - HoP 2",96.0
8131,"By anatomy we can lay bare the nerves, it is true, but not the manner of their working. 
 - HoP 2",97.0
8132,"We represent these to ourselves on the analogy of other phenomena of transmission, for instance as the vibration of a tense string that passes through the nerves to the brain. 
 - HoP 2",185.0
8134,"In the same way light is represented as filaments, rays, or as vibrations of the ether, or as globules of ether, each of which strikes on the other. 
 - HoP 2",158.0
8135,"This is an analogy quite in the manner of Epicurus. 
 - HoP 2",61.0
8137,"In so saying, Epicurus is talking idly; his words fall on the ear and the fancy, but looked on more narrowly they disappear. 
 - HoP 2",134.0
8138,"So, for instance, we see the moon shine, without being able to have any nearer experience of it. 
 - HoP 2",106.0
8139,"On this subject Epicurus says: The moon may have its own light, or a light borrowed from the sun; for even on earth we see things which shine of themselves, and many which are illuminated by others. 
 - HoP 2",208.0
8140,"Nothing hinders us from observing heavenly things in the light of various previous experiences, and from adopting hypotheses and explanations in accordance with these. 
 - HoP 2",177.0
8143,"In precisely the same way modern physicists transfer the production of an electric spark, when glass and silk are rubbed against each other, to the clouds. 
 - HoP 2",165.0
8144,"For, as we see a spark both in lightning and electricity, we conclude from this circumstance common to both that the two are analogical; therefore, we come to the conclusion that lightning also is an electric phenomenon. 
 - HoP 2",230.0
8145,"But clouds are not hard bodies, and by moisture electricity is more likely to be dispersed; therefore, such talk has just as little truth in it as the fancy of Epicurus. 
 - HoP 2",179.0
8147,"Application of sensuous conceptions according to analogy is often termed comprehension or explanation, but in reality there is in such a process not the faintest approach to thought or comprehension. 
 - HoP 2",209.0
8148,"One man,  adds Epicurus, may select; one of these modes, and reject the others, not considering what is possible for man to know, and what is impossible, and therefore striving to attain to a knowledge of the unknowable. 
 - HoP 2",230.0
8151,"This method of Epicurus has been attacked and derided, but on this score no one need be ashamed of or fight shy of it, if he is a physicist; for what Epicurus says is not a whit worse than what the moderns assert. 
 - HoP 2",223.0
8154,"This is a method devoid of reason, which reaches no further than to general conceptions. 
 - HoP 2",98.0
8156,"Of the Epicurean method in philosophy we may say this, that it likewise has a side on which it possesses value, and we may in some measure assent when we hear, as we frequently do, the Epicurean physics favourably spoken of. 
 - HoP 2",234.0
8157,"Aristotle and the earlier philosophers took their start in natural philosophy from universal thought a priori, and from this developed the Notion; this is the one side. 
 - HoP 2",178.0
8159,"The a priori is with Aristotle, for instance, most excellent but not sufficient, because to it there is lacking connection with and relation to experience and observation. 
 - HoP 2",181.0
8160,"This leading up of the particular to the universal is the finding out of laws, natural forces, and so on. 
 - HoP 2",115.0
8161,"It may thus be said that Epicurus is the inventor of empiric Natural Science, of empiric Psychology. 
 - HoP 2",110.0
8164,"The more, in later times, men made acquaintance with the laws of Nature, the more superstition, miracles, astrology, &c disappeared; all this fades away owing to the contradiction offered to it by the knowledge of natural laws. 
 - HoP 2",237.0
8166,"In contrast with this, the way in which Epicurus works, when the conceptions and not thought are concerned, accords with truth. 
 - HoP 2",137.0
8168,"The effect of the Epicurean philosophy in its own time was therefore this, that it set itself against the superstition of the Greeks and Romans, and elevated men above it. 
 - HoP 2",181.0
8170,"The physics of Epicurus were therefore famous for the reason that they introduced more enlightened views in regard to what is physical, and banished the fear of the gods. 
 - HoP 2",180.0
8171,"Superstition passes straightway from immediate appearances to God, angels, demons; or it expects from finite things other effects than the conditions admit of, phenomena of a higher kind. 
 - HoP 2",197.0
8173,"There connection is sought for in other finite things, in conditions which are themselves conditioned; superstition, on the contrary, rightly or wrongly, passes at once to what is above us.

 - HoP 2",227.0
8195,"But it is of importance to notice this, that when Epicurus sets tip pleasure as the end, he concedes this only so far as its enjoyment is the result of philosophy. 
 - HoP 2",173.0
8196,"We have before now remarked  that even with the Cyrenaics, while on the one hand sensation was certainly made the principle, on the other hand it was essential that thought should be in intimate connection with it.

8200,"The true Epicureans were therefore, just as much as the Stoics, raised above all particular ties, for Epicurus, too, made his aim the undisturbed tranquillity of the wise man. 
 - HoP 2",185.0

 - HoP 2",171.0
8342,"That is good; more fully the purport would be something like this: Thought, as subjective, is made to assent to an existence which is a determinate content of the conception. 
 - HoP 2",184.0
8343,"A sensuous image such as this, however, is foreign to thought, and with it thought cannot accord, because it is something different from it, something from which thought, on the contrary, holds itself aloof. 
 - HoP 2",217.0
8345,"Arcesilaus thus holds it up against the Stoics that their principle contains a contradiction within itself, because the conception of thought is made to be the thought of another, but thought can only think itself.

8441,"No further account of its content is given, but what is so frequently produced is, as empirical universality, made the first criterion. 
 - HoP 2",145.0
8442,"But this is only an individual and, speaking generally, an immediate and quite simple conception. 
 - HoP 2",107.0
8443,"Because, however, a conception is never for itself alone, but one depends on another as in a chain, the second criterion is added, viz. 
 - HoP 2",145.0
8444,"This is quite a correct determination, which everywhere appears in the universal. 
 - HoP 2",91.0
8445,"Nothing is seen or said alone, for a number of circumstances stand in connection with it.

8447,"If none of such circumstances make us uncertain or cause us to think the others false, but when all uniformly agree, the conception is the more convincing.

 - HoP 2",170.0
8742,"Sextus, and an Epicurean quoted by Cicero , adduce the manifold nature of dogmas, and from this the conclusion is drawn that the one has just as much support as the other.

 - HoP 2",158.0

 - HoP 2",176.0
8750,"For if deduction from reasons is made the power of knowledge, we must, on the other hand, remember that by so doing we have premises which are quite ungrounded. 
 - HoP 2",170.0
8751,"The trope of Relationship, the relativity of determinations , has already been found among those mentioned above. 
 - HoP 2",123.0

 - HoP 2",68.0
8765,"But however it may be determined, there always is a difference of opinion respecting it,  and specially of sophic opinions. 
 - HoP 2",133.0
8766,"This is the first trope. 
 - HoP 2",34.0
8767,"For some believe what is felt and others what is thought to be alone the truth,  ie the criterion; others, however, again accept partly what is thought and partly what is felt. 
 - HoP 2",186.0
8768,"There consequently is a contradiction present here. 
 - HoP 2",61.0
8769,"Now is it possible to harmonize this contradiction or not? If not, we must withhold our judgment. 
 - HoP 2",107.0
8771,"If what is felt is to be judged by what is felt, it is allowed  that this sensation requires another sensation as its reason;  for the conviction of its truth is not without contradiction. 
 - HoP 2",198.0
8772,"But if that which constitutes the reason is again a feeling, that which is said to be a reason must have a reason just as much; thus we go on into infinitude -and here we have the second trope. 
 - HoP 2",203.0
8773,"The case is, however, similar if what is thought is the criterion, or if the implicit is made to rest on it. 
 - HoP 2",118.0
8774,"If to what is thought is given the power of judging what is felt, this likewise, since it is that respecting which no harmony prevails, requires another as its ground. 
 - HoP 2",177.0
8775,"This reason is, however, something thought likewise, and it again requires a reason; thus this, too, passes into the infinite.

8776,"From effect men thus reach cause; nevertheless this too is not original, but is itself an effect; and so on. 
 - HoP 2",118.0
8778,"The false belief that this progression is a true category, is also to be found in Kant and Fichte; but there is really no true ultimate, or, what is the same, no true first. 
 - HoP 2",183.0
8779,"The understanding represents infinite progression as something great; but its contradiction is that men speak of a first cause and it is then shown that it is only an effect. 
 - HoP 2",184.0
8780,"Men only attain to the contradiction and constant repetition of the same, but not to the solution of it, and consequently to the true prius. 
 - HoP 2",150.0
8782,"In this way each would be founded without there having been a progression into infinitude; but then that which founds would also be that which is founded, and there would merely be a passing from one to the other. 
 - HoP 2",223.0
8783,"Thus, in the third place, this falls into the trope of Reciprocity, in which, however, there is no more than there was before any true foundation. 
 - HoP 2",156.0
8784,"For in it each merely exists through the other, neither is really set forth absolutely, but each is the implicit only for the other, and this is self-abrogation. 
 - HoP 2",171.0
8785,"But if this is avoided by an unproved axiom which is taken as an implicit fact, a first and absolute ground, this way of arguing falls into the mode of Pre-supposition-the fourth trope. 
 - HoP 2",195.0
8786,"But if an assumption such as this were to be allowed, it would also be legitimate for anyone to assume the contrary. 
 - HoP 2",126.0
8787,"Thus against the absolute assertion of idealism, The Absolute is the I,  it is with equal force maintained that The Absolute is existence. 
 - HoP 2",148.0
8788,"The one man says in the immediate certainty of himself: I am absolute to myself;  another man likewise in certainty of himself says, It is absolutely certain to me that things exist.

8789,"Idealism did not prove the former, nor did it destroy the latter; it takes its stand alongside of it, and only bases its assertions on its own principle. 
 - HoP 2",163.0
8790,"Everything, however, then, comes round to this, that because the I is absolute, the not-I cannot be absolute. 
 - HoP 2",119.0
8791,"On the other hand it may be said as justly: Because the thing is absolute, the I cannot be absolute. 
 - HoP 2",110.0
8793,"But as it is absurd to do so, so also is the other absurd. 
 - HoP 2",68.0
8794,"Men set to work in the finite sciences in a similar way. 
 - HoP 2",66.0
8795,"But when, as in a dogmatism like this, a man asserts his right of pre-supposing something, every other man has equally the right of pre-supposing something. 
 - HoP 2",166.0
8796,"Consequently the modern immediate revelation of the subject now appears. 
 - HoP 2",82.0
8797,"It does no good for any man to affirm, for example, that he finds in his consciousness that God exists; since anyone has the right to say that he finds in his consciousness that God does not exist. 
 - HoP 2",207.0
8799,"The same holds good with what is thought; as the universal object of thought it likewise has the form of being something for another. 
 - HoP 2",143.0
8801,"In this relationship to another this last, posited as its universality, is its reason; but this reason, as opposed to that which is proved, is itself a determinate, and consequently has its reality only in what is proved. 
 - HoP 2",231.0
8802,"And for the reason that I really again consider this universal as a determinate, it is conditioned by another like the one that goes before, and so on into infinity. 
 - HoP 2",175.0
8804,"And if the universal as the basis has its reality in the existent, and this existent its reality in the universal, this forms the Reciprocity whereby what in themselves are opposites mutually establish one another. 
 - HoP 2",224.0
8805,"But what is implicit is something which is not mediated through another; as the immediate, that is because it is, it is, however, an Hypothesis. 
 - HoP 2",154.0
8806,"Now if this determinate is taken as pre-supposed, so also may another be. 
 - HoP 2",83.0
8810,"To the Sceptics, the Notion of dogmatic philosophy is in effect that something is asserted as the implicit; it is thus opposed to idealism by the fact of its maintaining that an existence is the absolute. 
 - HoP 2",214.0
8811,"But there is a misunderstanding or a formal understanding in considering that all philosophy that is not Scepticism is Dogmatism. 
 - HoP 2",139.0
8812,"Dogmatism, as the Sceptics quite correctly describe it, consists in the assertion that something determinate, such as I or Being, Thought or Sensation, is the truth. 
 - HoP 2",175.0
8813,"In the talk about idealism, to which dogmatism has been opposed, just as many mistakes have been made, and misunderstandings taken place. 
 - HoP 2",147.0
8815,"By idealism that is likewise held to be dogmatism in which, as is the case in Plato and Spinoza, the absolute has been made the unity of self-consciousness and existence, and not self-consciousness opposed to existence. 
 - HoP 2",229.0
8819,"Consequently, each, as being a proposition, is the union of two moments between which there is an inherent difference, and whose union has to be mediated. 
 - HoP 2",164.0
8820,"Now dogmatic philosophy, which has this way of representing one principle in a determinate proposition as a fundamental principle, believes that it is therefore universal, and that the other is in subordination to it. 
 - HoP 2",227.0
8821,"And undoubtedly this is so. 
 - HoP 2",37.0
8822,"But at the same time, this its determinateness rests in the fact that it is only universal; hence such a principle is always conditioned, and consequently contains within it a destructive dialectic. 
 - HoP 2",208.0
8823,"As against all these dogmatic philosophies, such criticism and idealism not excepted, the sceptical tropes possess the negative capacity of demonstrating that what the former maintain to be the implicit is not really so. 
 - HoP 2",230.0
8824,"For implicitude such as this is a determinate, and cannot resist negativity, its abrogation. 
 - HoP 2",102.0
8825,"To Scepticism is due the honour of having obtained this knowledge of the negative, and of having so definitely thought out the forms of negativity. 
 - HoP 2",157.0
8826,"Scepticism does not operate by bringing forward what is called a difficulty, a possibility of representing the matter otherwise; that would merely indicate some sort of fancy which is contingent as regards this asserted knowledge. 
 - HoP 2",240.0
8827,"Scepticism is not an empiric matter such as this, for it contains a scientific aim, its tropes turn on the Notion, the very essence of determinateness, and are exhaustive as regards the determinate. 
 - HoP 2",208.0
8829,"These tropes are necessary contradictions into which the understanding falls; even in our time progression into infinitude and pre-supposition  are particularly common. 
 - HoP 2",178.0
8830,"Now, speaking generally, this is the method of Scepticism, and it is most important. 
 - HoP 2",94.0
8833,"Sextus, for example, takes up the individual sciences concretely, thereby demonstrating much capacity for abstraction, and he shows in all their determinations the opposite of themselves. 
 - HoP 2",197.0
8835,"On the one hand it is the negation of space, and, on the other, inasmuch as it is the limit of space, it touches space. 
 - HoP 2",129.0
8836,"Thus this negation of space participates in space, itself occupies space, and thus it is in itself null, but at the same time it is also in itself a dialectic. 
 - HoP 2",169.0
8838,"The two formal moments in this sceptical culture are firstly the power of consciousness to go back from itself, and to take as its object the whole that is present, itself and its operation included. 
 - HoP 2",209.0
8839,"The second moment is to grasp the form in which a proposition, with whose content our consciousness is in any way occupied, exists. 
 - HoP 2",141.0
8840,"An undeveloped consciousness, on the other hand, usually knows nothing of what is present in addition to the content. 
 - HoP 2",127.0
8841,"For instance, in the judgment This thing is one,  attention is paid only to the one and the thing, and not to the circumstance that here something, a determinate, is related to the one. 
 - HoP 2",195.0
8842,"But this relation is the essential, and the form of the determinate; it is that whereby this house which is an individual, makes itself one with the universal that is different from it. 
 - HoP 2",195.0
8843,"It is this logical element, ie the essential element, that Scepticism brings to consciousness, and on this it depends; an example of this is number, the one, as the hypothetical basis of arithmetic. 
 - HoP 2",208.0
8845,"As to God, for example, the Sceptics do not inquire whether He has such and such qualities, but turn to what is most inward, to what lies at the ground of this conception, and they ask whether this has reality. 
 - HoP 2",220.0
8846,"Since we do not know the reality of God,  says Sextus , we shall not be able to know and perceive His qualities. 
 - HoP 2",122.0
8847,"Likewise in the preceding books , inquiry is made as to whether the criterion of truth as fixed by the understanding is anything, whether we know the thing in itself, or whether the I is to itself the only absolute certainty. 
 - HoP 2",235.0
8848,"This is the way to penetrate to reality. 
 - HoP 2",50.0
8849,"In these ways the operations of Scepticism are undoubtedly directed against the finite. 
 - HoP 2",97.0
8855,"That is to say it comprehends it falsely and then proceeds to contradict it. 
 - HoP 2",86.0
8856,"Or it first of all gives the infinite the itch in order to be able to scratch it. 
 - HoP 2",91.0
8857,"The Scepticism of modern times, with which for crudity of comprehension and false teaching the old cannot compare, is specially noteworthy in this respect. 
 - HoP 2",165.0
8860,"Now, here, according to the conception of the non-speculative sciences, it is placed in this dilemma: the principle is either an unproved hypothesis or demands a proof which in turn implies the principle. 
 - HoP 2",214.0
8863,"The Notion is a self-movement, and not, as in a proposition, a desire to rest; nor is it true that the proof brings forward another ground or middle term and is another movement; for it has this movement in itself. 
 - HoP 2",224.0
8864,"Sextus Empiricus , for example, thus reaches the speculative Idea regarding reason, which, as the thought of thought, comprehends itself, and is thus in its freedom at home with itself. 
 - HoP 2",195.0
8865,"We saw this  with Aristotle. 
 - HoP 2",38.0
8866,"In order to refute this idea, Sextus argues in the following way: The reason that comprehends is either the whole or it is only a part. 
 - HoP 2",145.0
8867,"But to know the speculative it is requisite that there should be, besides the either. 
 - HoP 2",95.0
8868,"If reason as the comprehending is the whole, nothing else remains to be comprehended. 
 - HoP 2",95.0
8870,"But the relationship of whole and part is not a relationship of reason to itself, being much too unimportant, and quite unworthy of being brought into the speculative Idea. 
 - HoP 2",182.0
8871,"In the second place Scepticism is wrong in allowing this relationship to hold good immediately, as it does in the ordinary and arid conception, where we make no objection to it. 
 - HoP 2",187.0
8872,"When reflection speaks of a whole, there is for it beyond this nothing else remaining. 
 - HoP 2",96.0
8873,"But the whole is just the being opposed to itself. 
 - HoP 2",60.0
8874,"On the one hand it is as whole simply identical with its parts, and, on the other hand, the parts are identical with the whole, since they together constitute the whole. 
 - HoP 2",179.0
8875,"The self-comprehension of reason is just like the comprehension by the whole of all its parts, if it is taken in its real speculative significance; and only in this sense could this relationship be dealt with here. 
 - HoP 2",224.0
8877,"Outside of the whole there thus undoubtedly remains another, namely itself as the manifold of its parts.

8879,"The case is similar when it is said; Objectivity and subjectivity are different, and thus their unity cannot be expressed. 
 - HoP 2",132.0
8880,"It is indeed maintained that the words are literally adhered to; but even as contained in these words, the determination is one-sided, and the other also pertains to it.

8882,"We may perhaps have said enough about the scientific nature of Scepticism, and we have concluded therewith the second section of Greek philosophy. 
 - HoP 2",156.0

8887,"External objectivity is not an objective existence nor a universal thought; for it merely is the fact that the individual consciousness exists, and that it is universal.

 - HoP 2",120.0
9035,"Before entering upon them we must, however, make cursory mention of Philo the Jew, and also notice sundry moments appearing in the history of the Church. 
 - HoP 2",163.0
9036,"Philo, a learned Jew of Alexandria, lived before and after the birth of Christ, in the reigns of the first Roman Emperors; that is to say, he was born B. 
 - HoP 2",163.0
9037,"In him we for the first time see the application of the universal consciousness as philosophical consciousness. 
 - HoP 2",121.0
9039,"There is a tradition that he came also in the reign of the Emperor Claudius to Rome, and there fell in with the Apostle Peter. 
 - HoP 2",136.0
9040,"Philo was famous for the great extent of his learning, and was well acquainted with Greek philosophy. 
 - HoP 2",111.0
9041,"He is more especially distinguished for his Platonic philosophy, and also for the pains he took to demonstrate the presence of Philosophy in the sacred writings of the Jews. 
 - HoP 2",183.0
9042,"In his explanation of the history of the Jewish nation, the narratives and statements therein contained have lost for him the immediate significance of reality. 
 - HoP 2",170.0
9043,"He reads into them throughout a mystical and allegorical meaning, and finds Plato present in Moses; in short, the endeavour of Philo resembled that of the Alexandrians when they recognized philosophic dogmas in Greek mythology. 
 - HoP 2",237.0
9044,"He treats of the nature of Mind, not, indeed, as comprehended in the element of thought, but as expressed therein, and this expression is still both far from pure and is associated with all sorts of imageries. 
 - HoP 2",219.0
9046,"That is the character of the time, in consequence of which all that appealed to the finite understanding in popular conceptions has not endured. 
 - HoP 2",154.0
9048,"Although in the external histories of the Jewish and heathen religions men had the authority and starting-point of truth, they yet grasped the thought that truth cannot be given externally. 
 - HoP 2",199.0
9049,"Therefore, men read deep thoughts into history, as the expression is, or they read them out of it, and this latter is the true conception. 
 - HoP 2",148.0
9050,"For in the case of the Divine Book, whose author is the Spirit, it cannot be said that this spirituality is absent.

9052,"There is, generally speaking, a great difference between that which is present therein and that which is expressed. 
 - HoP 2",125.0
9055,"On the one side, the bringing of thought into definite consciousness is a bringing in from without, but on the other side, as far as matter is concerned, there is nothing brought in from without. 
 - HoP 2",205.0
9056,"Philos methods present this aspect in a pre-eminent sense. 
 - HoP 2",68.0
9057,"All that is prosaic has disappeared, and, therefore, in writers of the period that follows, miracles are of common occurrence, inasmuch as external connection is no longer required as a matter of necessity. 
 - HoP 2",216.0
9058,"With Philo the main point is the knowledge of God. 
 - HoP 2",60.0
9059,"In regard to this, he says, in the first place: God can be known only by the eye of the soul, only by Beholding. 
 - HoP 2",122.0
9060,"This he also calls rapture, ecstasy, Gods influence; we often find these terms. 
 - HoP 2",89.0
9061,"For this it is requisite that the soul should break loose from the body, and should give up its sensuous existence, thus rising to the pure object of thought, where it finds itself nearer to God. 
 - HoP 2",205.0
9062,"We may term this a beholding by the intelligence. 
 - HoP 2",59.0
9063,"But the other side is that God cannot be discerned by the eye of the soul; the soul can only know that He is, and not what He is. 
 - HoP 2",139.0
9064,"His essence is the primordial light. 
 - HoP 2",46.0
9065,"So long, therefore, as the determination of simplicity is adhered to, this First Light permits not itself to be known, and since Philo says, This One is God as such,  we cannot know what God is. 
 - HoP 2",204.0
9066,"In Christianity, on the contrary, simplicity is only a moment, and only in the Whole do we find God the Spirit. 
 - HoP 2",121.0
9067,"Philo continues: The First is the space of the universe, encompassing and filling it; this existence is itself place, and is filled by itself. 
 - HoP 2",152.0
9068,"God is sufficient for Himself; all other things are paltry and meaningless; He fills all other things and gives them coherence, but He Himself is surrounded by nothing, because He Himself is One and All. 
 - HoP 2",213.0
9069,"Similarly, God exists in the primordial form of time , 209 that is, in the pure Notion of time. 
 - HoP 2",105.0
9070,"Why is it necessary that God should fill Himself with Himself? Even the subjective and abstract has need also of an object. 
 - HoP 2",133.0
9071,"But the all is likewise, as with Parmenides, the abstract, because it is only substance, which remains empty beside that which fills it. 
 - HoP 2",146.0
9072,"Absolute fulness, on the other hand, is the concrete, and we reach this first in the Î»ÏÎ³Î¿Ï, in which we have that which fills, that which is filled, and a third composed of both. 
 - HoP 2",193.0
9073,"To this Philo now comes in the second place: Gods image and reflection is thinking reason , the Firstborn Son, who rules and regulates the world. 
 - HoP 2",155.0
9074,"This Î»ÏÎ³Î¿Ï is the innermost meaning of all Ideas; God Himself, in contrast to this, as the One, as such, is pure Being  only210-an expression which Plato also used. 
 - HoP 2",179.0
9075,"Here verily we come upon a contradiction; for the image can only represent what the thing is; if therefore the image is concrete, its original must also be understood to be concrete. 
 - HoP 2",192.0
9076,"For the rest, it is therefore only logical, after Philo has once limited the name of God to the First Light or to pure Being, to assert that only the Son can be known. 
 - HoP 2",177.0
9077,"For as this Being God is only abstract existence, or only His own Notion; and it is quite true that the soul cannot perceive what this Being is, since it is really only an empty abstraction. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
9078,"What can be perceived is that pure existence is only an abstraction, and consequently a nothing, and not the true God. 
 - HoP 2",128.0
9079,"Of God as the One it may therefore be said that the only thing perceived is that He does exist. 
 - HoP 2",105.0
9080,"Perception is the knowledge of the concrete self-determination of the living God. 
 - HoP 2",91.0
9082,"What is begotten is His other, which at the same time is in Him, and belongs to Him, and is thus a moment of Himself, if God is to be thought of as concrete and living it is this that is here by Philo called Î»ÏÎ³Î¿Ï. 
 - HoP 2",229.0
9083,"In Christianity the name of God is therefore not limited to Essence, but the Son is conceived of as a determination which itself belongs to the true Essence of God. 
 - HoP 2",174.0
9084,"That which God is, He is therefore as Spirit only, and that is the unity of these moments. 
 - HoP 2",100.0
9085,"Gods differences therefore, according to Philo, constitute the finite understanding  itself, which is then the archangel , a realm of thought which contains determinateness. 
 - HoP 2",183.0
9086,"That is man as heavenly man, primeval man, who is also represented under the name of Wisdom , as Adam Kadmon, as the rising of the sun-man in God. 
 - HoP 2",156.0
9087,"This finite understanding now separates itself into Ideas, which by Philo are also named angels or messengers. 
 - HoP 2",120.0
9088,"This mode of conception is not yet conception in pure thought, for forms of the imagination are still interwoven with it. 
 - HoP 2",131.0
9089,"Moreover there comes in here for the first time that which determines, where God is looked on as activity, which so far Being was not. 
 - HoP 2",144.0
9090,"This Î»ÏÎ³Î¿Ï is therefore itself, we might say, the first restful world of thought, although it is already differentiated; but another Î»ÏÎ³Î¿Ï is that which gives utterance  as speech. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
9091,"That is the activity, the creation of the world, as the former is its preservation, its permanent understanding. 
 - HoP 2",122.0
9092,"Speech has always been regarded as a manifestation of God, because it is not corporeal; as sound it is momentary and immediately disappears; its existence is therefore immaterial. 
 - HoP 2",189.0
9093,"God created by the word of His month, interposing nothing;  what He created remains ideal, like speech. 
 - HoP 2",113.0
9094,"If we would express the dogma in a still truer form, the Logos is the Work of God. 
 - HoP 2",92.0
9095,"This Logos is at the same time the teacher of wisdom for self-consciousness. 
 - HoP 2",86.0
9096,"For natural things are upheld only in their laws; but self-conscious beings know also of these laws, and this is wisdom. 
 - HoP 2",130.0
9097,"Thus the Î»ÏÎ³Î¿Ï is the high priest, who is the mediator between God and man, the Spirit of the Godhead, who teaches man-even the self-conscious return of God into Himself, into that first unity of the primordial light. 
 - HoP 2",232.0
9098,"That is the pure intelligible world of truth itself, which is nothing other than the Word of God. 
 - HoP 2",107.0
9099,"In the third place, since thought has come to negativity, the sensuous existent world stands in opposition to this ideal world. 
 - HoP 2",137.0
9100,"Its principle with Philo, as with Plato, is matter, the negative. 
 - HoP 2",75.0
9101,"As God is Being, so the essence of matter is non-being; it is not nothing, as when we say that God created the world out of nothing, for non-being, the opposite of Being, is itself a positive, and as good as Being. 
 - HoP 2",224.0
9102,"It exists, in so far as there is placed within it a resemblance to implicit truth. 
 - HoP 2",92.0
9103,"Philo had the true perception that the opposite of Being is just as positive as Being. 
 - HoP 2",96.0
9104,"If this seems absurd to anyone, he need only be reminded that really when we posit Being, the negative of Being is thinking-which is something very positive. 
 - HoP 2",167.0
9105,"But the next step, the Notion of this opposition, and the passing of Being into non-being, is not to be found in Philo. 
 - HoP 2",129.0

9368,"Further, there is for it a three-fold mode of thinking: in the first place it thinks the unchangeable, its unity, as object.

9381,"Plotinus thus distinguishes in Î½Î¿á¿¦Ï thinking , the object thought of , and thought , so that Î½Î¿á¿¦Ï is one, and at the same time all; but thought is the unity of what had been distinguished.

9405,"It would not be inappropriate to give the name of form and idea to energy, in so far as it exists as energy and not as mere potentiality-not simply as energy, but as the energy of something determinate. 
 - HoP 2",212.0
9406,"For we might give the name more properly, perhaps, to another energy, namely that which is opposed to the potentiality which leads to actuality, for the possible has the possibility of being something else in actuality. 
 - HoP 2",229.0
9407,"But through possibility the possible has also in itself actuality, just as skill has the activity related thereto, and as bravery has brave action. 
 - HoP 2",157.0
9409,"Should we consider matter to be there as form, as even the soul, although a form, is matter in respect to what is different? But, speaking generally, matter is not in actuality, it is what exists in potentiality. 
 - HoP 2",222.0
9410,"Its Being only announces a Becoming, so that its Being has always to do with future Being.

9412,"Matter consequently always leans towards something else, or is a potentiality for what follows; it is left behind as a feeble and dim image that cannot take shape. 
 - HoP 2",173.0
9413,"Is it then an image in respect to reality, and therefore a deception? This is the same as a true deception, this is the true non-existent;  it is untrue by reason of energy. 
 - HoP 2",183.0
9414,"That is therefore not existent in actuality which has its truth in the non-existent;  it exists not in truth, for it has its Being in non-Being.

9415,"If you take away from the false its falseness, you take away all the existence that it has. 
 - HoP 2",101.0
9416,"Similarly, if you introduce actuality into that which has its Being and its essence in potentiality, you destroy the cause of its substance , because Being consisted for it in potentiality. 
 - HoP 2",199.0
9417,"If we would therefore retain matter uninjured, we must keep it as matter; apparently we must therefore say that it is only in potentiality, in order that it may remain what it is. 
 - HoP 2",189.0
9419,"When defined in one mode, it is really rather the opposite; that is to say, when looked at and fixed, it is not fixed and escapes, or when not fixed it is fixed-the simply illusory. 
 - HoP 2",191.0
9420,"Matter itself is therefore imperishable; there is nothing into which it can change. 
 - HoP 2",93.0
9421,"The Idea of change is itself imperishable, but what is implied in this Idea is changeable.

9422,"This matter is nevertheless not without form; and we have seen that the finite understanding has a third relationship to its object, namely in reference to differences. 
 - HoP 2",178.0
9424,"The Evil likewise, as contrasted with the Good, now begins to be the object of consideration, for the question of the origin of evil must always be a matter of interest to the human consciousness. 
 - HoP 2",206.0
9426,"Plotinus regards this question of evil from many sides; but thoughtful consideration of this subject does not yet go very far. 
 - HoP 2",136.0
9428,"But Î½Î¿á¿¦Ï, as we now understand it, contains all things in itself, is all things, and is at home with itself; it has all things while not having them,  because it is in itself ideal.

9429,"But it does not possess all in the sense in which we regard what we possess as something different or alien from ourselves; what is possessed is not distinguished from itself.

 - HoP 2",170.0
9437,"Nothing remains then but that evil, if it exists, is in the non-existent, as a form of the non-existent-but the non-existent not as altogether non-existent, but only as something other than the existent.

9438,"Evil is no absolute principle independent of God, as the ManichÃ¦ans held it to be. 
 - HoP 2",93.0
9439,"It is not non-existent in the same way that motion and rest are existent, but is like an image of the existent, or non-existent in an even greater degree; it is the sensuous universe.

9440,"Thus evil has its root in the non-existent. 
 - HoP 2",53.0
9441,"In the eighth book of the first Ennead Plotinus says : But how is evil recognized? It is owing to thought turning away from itself that matter arises; it exists only through the abstraction of what is other than itself. 
 - HoP 2",229.0
9442,"What remains behind when we take away the Ideas is, we say, matter; thought accordingly becomes different, the opposite of thought, since it dares to direct itself on that which is not within its province. 
 - HoP 2",215.0
9444,"This abstract other is nothing but matter, and it is also evil; the seeing of the less measure is nothing but a non-seeing. 
 - HoP 2",133.0
9445,"The sensuous in regard to measure, or the limited, is the less measure, the boundless, the undefined, unresting, insatiable, the utterly deficient; such is not accidental to it, but its substance.

9448,"But why then, when there is the Good, is there also necessarily Evil? Because there must be matter in the whole, because the whole necessarily consists of opposites. 
 - HoP 2",175.0
9449,"It would not be there, if matter were not present; the nature of the world is compounded of Î½Î¿á¿¦Ï and necessity. 
 - HoP 2",126.0
9450,"To be with the gods means to be in thought; for they are immortal. 
 - HoP 2",76.0
9451,"We may also apprehend the necessity of evil in this wise: As the Good cannot exist alone, matter is a counterpart to the Good, necessary to its production. 
 - HoP 2",165.0
9452,"Or we might also say that Evil is that which by reason of constant deterioration and decay has sunk until it can sink no lower; but something is necessary after the first, so that the extreme is also necessary. 
 - HoP 2",220.0
9453,"But that is matter, which has no longer any element of good in it; and this is the necessity of evil.

9546,"But since we now ascribe no substantiality, no proper Being to a thought, all such determinations are only moments of a thing in thought. 
 - HoP 2",147.0
9551,"Respecting these negations  Proclus now says  that they do not signify an abrogation of the content  of which they are predicated, but are the creation of determinatives in accordance with their opposites. 
 - HoP 2",215.0
9552,"Thus if Plato shows that the first is not many, this has the significance that the many proceed from the first; if he shows that it is not a whole, it proves that the fact of being a whole proceeds from it. 
 - HoP 2",216.0
9553,"The mode  of negations is thus to be taken as perfection which remains in unity, issues forth from everything, and is in an inexpressible and ineffable preponderance of simplicity. 
 - HoP 2",190.0
9554,"On the other hand, God must likewise be derived from these negations; else there would be no Notion  of them, and also no negation. 
 - HoP 2",141.0
9555,"The Notion of the inexpressible revolves round itself, never resting, and it strives with itself;  ie the one implies its determinations ideally, the whole is contained in the one. 
 - HoP 2",190.0
9556,"Multiplicity is not taken empirically and then merely abrogated; the negative, as dividing, producing, and active, not merely contains what is privative, but also affirmative determinations. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
9557,"In this way the Platonic dialectic wins for Proclus a positive significance; through dialectic he would lead all differences back to unity. 
 - HoP 2",149.0
9558,"With this dialectic of the one and many Proclus makes much ado, more especially in his famous elementary doctrines. 
 - HoP 2",125.0
9559,"The submersion of everything in unity remains, however, merely beyond this unity, instead of which this very negativity must really be grasped as signifying its production. 
 - HoP 2",182.0
9560,"That which brings forth, according to Proclus, furthermore brings forth through a superfluity of power. 
 - HoP 2",113.0
9561,"There certainly also is a bringing forth through want; all need, all desire, for example, becomes cause through want; and its bringing forth is its satisfaction. 
 - HoP 2",171.0
9562,"The end here is incomplete, and the energy arises from the endeavour to complete itself, so that only in production the need becomes less, the desire ceases to be such, or its abstract Being-for-self disappears. 
 - HoP 2",221.0
9563,"Unity, on the other hand, goes forth out of itself through the superfluity of potentiality, and this superabundant potentiality is actuality generally: this reflection of Proclus is quite Aristotelian. 
 - HoP 2",211.0
9564,"Hence the coming forth of the unity consists in the fact that it multiplies itself, pure number comes forth; but this multiplication does not negate or diminish that first unity, but rather takes place in the method of unity. 
 - HoP 2",235.0
9565,"The many partakes of the unity, but the unity does not partake of multiplicity. 
 - HoP 2",89.0
9566,"The absolute unity which multiplies itself into many ones has consequently generated multiplicity as it is in these ones. 
 - HoP 2",131.0
9567,"Proclus makes use of a many-sided dialectic to show that the many does not exist in itself, is not the creator of the many, that everything goes back into unity, and thus unity is also the originator of the many. 
 - HoP 2",222.0
9568,"It is, however, not made clear how this is the negative relation of the one to itself; what we see is then a manifold dialectic, which merely passes backwards and forwards over the relationship of the one to the many. 
 - HoP 2",227.0
9569,"To Proclus an important characteristic of this progression is the fact that it takes place through analogy, and what is dissimilar to the truth is the further removed from the same. 
 - HoP 2",191.0
9570,"The many partakes of unity, but it is in a measure likewise not one, but dissimilar to one. 
 - HoP 2",101.0
9571,"But since the many is also similar to what produces it, it likewise has unity as its essence; hence the many are independent unities. 
 - HoP 2",143.0
9572,"They contain the principle of unity within themselves, for if as being many they are likewise different, they are, so to speak, only many for a third, being in and for themselves unities. 
 - HoP 2",197.0
9573,"These unities again beget others which must, however, be less perfect, for the effect is not exactly like the cause, that which is brought forth is not quite similar to what brings it forth. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
9574,"These next unities are wholes, ie, they are no longer real unities, unities in themselves, since in them the unity is only an accident. 
 - HoP 2",145.0
9575,"But because things themselves are in their synthetic nature merely wholes because their souls bind them together, they are dissimilar to the first unity, and cannot be immediately united to it. 
 - HoP 2",203.0
9576,"The abstractly conceived multiplicity is thus their mean; multiplicity is analogous to absolute unity, and is that which unites unity with the whole universe. 
 - HoP 2",168.0
9577,"Pure multiplicity makes the different elements like one another, and hence unites them to unity; but things only have similarity to unity. 
 - HoP 2",148.0
9578,"Thus things that are begotten ever remove themselves more and more from unity, and partake of it less and less. 
 - HoP 2",121.0
9579,"The further determination of the Idea is known as the trinity. 
 - HoP 2",72.0
9580,"Of this Proclus  first of all gives the abstract definition that its three forms are three gods, and now we have more especially to find out how he defined the trinity. 
 - HoP 2",178.0
9581,"This trinity is certainly interesting in the Neo-Platonists, but it is specially so in the case of Proclus, because he did not leave it in its abstract moments. 
 - HoP 2",170.0
9582,"For he again considers these three abstract determinations of the absolute, each on its own account, as a totality of triunity, whereby he obtains one real trinity. 
 - HoP 2",174.0
9585,"It will be shown directly which orders these are, and Proclus occupies himself much with these, because he tries to demonstrate the different powers again in them. 
 - HoP 2",173.0
9586,"Proclus is hence much more detailed, and he went much further than did Plotinus; it may indeed be said that in this respect we find in him the most excellent and best that was formulated by any of the Neo-Platonists. 
 - HoP 2",226.0
9589,"This unity is the super-substantial , and in the second place its first production is the many ones  of things, pure numbers. 
 - HoP 2",135.0
9591,"To this Proclus refers the forms of ancient mythology. 
 - HoP 2",64.0
9592,"That is to say, as he calls that first unity God, he calls these numerous unities of thought that flow from it, gods, but the following moments are likewise so called. 
 - HoP 2",177.0
9593,"He says, : The gods are named in accordance with what depends upon the orders ; hence it is possible to know from this their unknowable substances, which constitute their determinate nature. 
 - HoP 2",200.0
9594,"For everything divine is inexpressible on its own account and unknowable as forming part of the inexpressible one; but from differentiation, from change, it comes to pass that we know its characteristics. 
 - HoP 2",214.0
9595,"Thus there are gods capable of being known, which radiate true Being; hence true Being is the knowable divine, and the incommunicable is made manifest for the Î½Î¿á¿¦Ï. 
 - HoP 2",179.0
9596,"But there always remains a compulsion to represent mythology in the determinateness of the Notion. 
 - HoP 2",108.0
9597,"These gods or unities do not correspond to the order of things in such a way that there are just as many and such unities  or gods as there are things; for these unities only unite things with the absolute unity. 
 - HoP 2",222.0
9598,"The third is just the limit which holds these unities  together, and constitutes their unity with the absolute unity; the limit asserts the unity of the many and the one. 
 - HoP 2",180.0
9600,"But to such abstractions the name gods is not applicable, for it is as returning that we first of all see them as divine. 
 - HoP 2",131.0
9601,"Proclus says : From that first limit ,  the absolute one, things have  union, entirety and community,  the principle of individuality, and divine measure. 
 - HoP 2",164.0
9604,"In all opposition which is found in species that are divine, what is more excellent belongs to limitation, and what is less excellent to the infinite. 
 - HoP 2",160.0
9605,"From these two principles everything derives its progress until it steps forth into Being. 
 - HoP 2",100.0
9606,"Thus the eternal, in so far as it is measure as intellectual, partakes of limitation, but in so far as it is the cause of unceasing effort after Being, of infinitude. 
 - HoP 2",176.0
9607,"Thus the understanding in so far as it has the standard  within it, is a product of limitation; in so far as it eternally produces everything, it has undiminished capacity for infinitude. 
 - HoP 2",197.0
9608,"Multiplicity as Notion, not as the many, is itself unity; it is duality, or the determinateness which stands over against indeterminateness. 
 - HoP 2",150.0
9609,"Now according to Proclus  the third is a whole, the unity of determinate and indeterminate, or that which is mingled. 
 - HoP 2",127.0
9610,"This is first of all everything existent, a monad of many possibilities, a completed reality, a many in one. 
 - HoP 2",118.0
9612,"Now if we consider further the nature of what is mingled we find the three triads likewise, for each of those three abstract principles is itself a similar complete triad, but under one or these particular forms. 
 - HoP 2",222.0
9613,"Proclus says ; The first Being  is the mingled, the unity of the triad with itself; it is the Being of the life as well as of the understanding. 
 - HoP 2",154.0
9614,"The first of what is mingled is the first of all existence, the life and the spirit are the two other orders; everything is consequently in triads. 
 - HoP 2",157.0
9615,"These three triads determine themselves thus as absolute Being, life and spirit; and they are spiritual and to be grasped in thought. 
 - HoP 2",143.0
9616,"According to this only the intelligible world is true for Proclus. 
 - HoP 2",76.0
9617,"But that Proclus did not make the understanding proceed immediately from the unity, is the second point in which he differs from Plotinus; in this Proclus is more logical, and he follows Plato more closely. 
 - HoP 2",216.0
9620,"As a matter of fact we find more distinction and clearness in Proclus than in the turbidity of Plotinus; he is quite correct in recognizing the Î½Î¿á¿¦Ï as the third, for it is, that which turns back. 
 - HoP 2",211.0
9622,"The life that is grasped by thought is the very centre-point of existence. 
 - HoP 2",84.0
9623,"But the understanding is the limit of the existent, and it is thought as known , for in what is thought is thinking, and in thinking what is thought. 
 - HoP 2",159.0
9624,"But in what is thought thinking is in the mode of thought , in thinking what is thought is in the mode of thinking. 
 - HoP 2",125.0
9625,"Substance is the enduring element in existence and that which is interwoven with the first principles and which does not proceed from the one. 
 - HoP 2",152.0
9626,"The second, the life, is however that which proceeds from the principles and is born with infinite capacity;  it is itself the whole totality in the determination of infinitude, so that it is a concrete manifold. 
 - HoP 2",222.0
9627,"The understanding is, again, the limit which leads back once more to the principles, brings about conformity with the principle, and accomplishes an intellectual circle. 
 - HoP 2",179.0
9629,"That is the first reality. 
 - HoP 2",36.0
9630,"Excellent! I call it substance, since the first substance  is supreme over all existence and is, so to speak, the monad of everything. 
 - HoP 2",144.0
9631,"The understanding itself is that which knows, but life is thinking, and Being is just what is thought. 
 - HoP 2",112.0
9632,"Now if the whole of what exists is mingled, but the first existence  is substance, the substance that comes from the three principles  is mingled. 
 - HoP 2",156.0
9633,"What is mingled is thus substance as thought; it is from God, from whom also come the infinite and limitation. 
 - HoP 2",120.0
9634,"There are thus four moments, since what is mingled is the fourth. 
 - HoP 2",75.0
9635,"The first is the monad, the absolute one, then come the many which themselves are units, the infinite of Plato; the third is limitation. 
 - HoP 2",146.0
9637,"This united one is not only derived from those principles which are according to the one, but it also goes forth from them and is three-fold. 
 - HoP 2",151.0
9638,"It is one trinity and three trinities. 
 - HoP 2",48.0
9639,"The limit and the infinite are, according to Proclus , before substance and again in it; and this unity of moments is what comes first in all existence. 
 - HoP 2",162.0
9640,"In the abstract trinity everything is thus contained in itself. 
 - HoP 2",73.0
9641,"Proclus says : The truly existent has the trinity of Beauty, Truth, and Symmetry in itself  , Beauty for order, Truth for purity, and Symmetry for the unity of what is joined together. 
 - HoP 2",194.0
9642,"Symmetry gives the cause that the existent is unity; Truth, that it is Being; Beauty, that it is thought. 
 - HoP 2",115.0
9643,"Proclus shows that in each of the three triads, limit, the unlimited, and that which is mingled, are contained; each order is thus the same, but set forth in one of the three forms which constitute the first triad. 
 - HoP 2",224.0
9644,"Proclus says : Now this is the first triad of all that is thought-the limit, the infinite, and that which is mingled. 
 - HoP 2",127.0
9645,"The limit is God going forth to the culminating point of thought from the uncommunicable and first God, measuring and determining everything, admitting all that is paternal and coherent, and the unblemished race of gods. 
 - HoP 2",230.0
9646,"But the infinite   is the inexhaustible potentiality of this God, that which makes all productions and orders to appear, and the whole infinitude, the primeval essence as well as the substantial, and even the ultimate matter. 
 - HoP 2",235.0
9648,"The first order is thus in its culminating point the abstract substance in which the three determinations as such are shut up without development and maintained in strict isolation; this pure reality is in so far the undisclosed. 
 - HoP 2",239.0
9650,"This second triad is placed in the determination of the infinite. 
 - HoP 2",75.0
9652,"As the first unity begets the culminating point of existence, the middle unity begets the middle existence; for it is likewise begetting and self-retaining. 
 - HoP 2",166.0
9653,"In the second order three moments again appear as before: Here the principle or the first is the substance which was the completion of the first triad; the second, which was there the infinite, is here potentiality. 
 - HoP 2",225.0
9654,"The unity of both these is Life ,  the centre, or what gives determinateness to the whole order; the second existence is life as thought, for in the most external thought Ideas have their subsistence. 
 - HoP 2",210.0
9655,"The second order is a triad analogous to the first, for the second is likewise a God. 
 - HoP 2",95.0
9657,"Limitation determines the first trinity, the unlimited the second, the concrete  the third. 
 - HoP 2",101.0
9658,"Each determination of unity, the one placed beside the other, also explains the intelligible order of gods; each contains all three moments subordinate to itself, and each is this trinity set forth under one of these moments. 
 - HoP 2",235.0
9659,"These three orders are the highest gods; later on, we find in Proclus  four orders of gods appearing. 
 - HoP 2",111.0
9661,"This third triad does not resemble cause , like the first existence, nor does it reveal the all like the second; but it is all as act and expression ; hence it is also the limit of all that is thought. 
 - HoP 2",211.0
9662,"The first triad remains concealed in limit itself, and has all subsistence of intellectuality fixed in it. 
 - HoP 2",116.0
9663,"The second is likewise enduring, and at the same time steps forward;  the living appears, but is in so doing led back to unity. 
 - HoP 2",137.0
9664,"The third after progression shifts and turns the intelligible limit back to the beginning, and bends the order back into itself; for the understanding is the turning back to what is thought  , and the giving of conformity with it. 
 - HoP 2",240.0
9665,"And all this is one thought, one Idea: persistence, progression and return. 
 - HoP 2",85.0
9666,"Each is a totality on its own account, but all three are led back into one. 
 - HoP 2",85.0
9667,"In the Î½Î¿á¿¦Ï the first two triads are themselves only moments; for spirit is just the grasping in itself of the totality of the first two spheres. 
 - HoP 2",160.0
9669,"In this the mystic element is that these differences which are determined as totalities, as gods, become comprehended as one. 
 - HoP 2",135.0
9670,"The expression mystic  often appears with the Neo-Platonists. 
 - HoP 2",71.0
9671,"Thus Proclus for example says : Let us once more obtain initiation into the mysteries  of the one. 
 - HoP 2",108.0
9672,"Mysticism is just this speculative consideration of Philosophy, this Being in thought, this self-satisfaction and this sensuous perception. 
 - HoP 2",149.0
9673,"However, Î¼ÏÏÏÎ®ÏÎ¹Î¿Î½ has not to the Alexandrians the meaning that it has to us, for to them it indicates speculative philosophy generally. 
 - HoP 2",155.0
9674,"The mysteries in Christianity have likewise been to the understanding an incomprehensible secret, but because they are speculative, reason comprehends them, and they are not really secret, for they have been revealed. 
 - HoP 2",227.0
9675,"In conclusion, Proclus institutes a comparison between these triads. 
 - HoP 2",78.0
9676,"In the first order the concrete is itself substance, in the second it is life, and in the third the thought that is known. 
 - HoP 2",132.0
9677,"Proclus calls substance likewise á¼ÏÏÎ¯Î±, the fixed, the principle. 
 - HoP 2",81.0
9679,"These three are thus clearly the absolute one, and this then constitutes one absolute concrete God. 
 - HoP 2",109.0
9680,"God knows the divided as undivided, what pertains to time as timeless, what is not necessary as necessary, the changeable as unchangeable, and, speaking generally, all things more excellently than in accordance with their order. 
 - HoP 2",238.0
9681,"Whose are the thoughts, his also are the substances, because the thought of every man is identical with the existence of every man, and each is both the thought and the existence,  and so on. 
 - HoP 2",201.0
9682,"These are the principal points in the theology of Proclus, and it only remains to us to give some external facts. 
 - HoP 2",123.0
9683,"The individuality of consciousness is partially in the form of an actuality, as magic and theurgy; this often appears among the Neo-Platonists and with Proclus, and is called making a god. 
 - HoP 2",198.0
9684,"The element of theurgy is thus brought into relation with the heathen divinities: The first and chief names of the gods, one must admit, are founded in the gods themselves. 
 - HoP 2",182.0
9685,"Divine thought makes names of its thoughts, and finally shows the images of the gods; each name gives rise, so to speak, to an image of a god. 
 - HoP 2",152.0
9687,"Thus the statues and pictures of artists show the inward speculative thought, the being replete with the divinity that brings itself into externality; thus the consecration of images is likewise represented. 
 - HoP 2",217.0
9688,"This connecting fact-that the Neo-Platonists have even inspired the mythical element with the divine-is thereby expressed, so that in images, &c, the divine power is present. 
 - HoP 2",184.0
9689,"Nevertheless I have only wished to call this moment to mind because it plays a great part at this particular time. 
 - HoP 2",124.0
9690,"In Proclus we have the culminating point of the Neo-Platonic philosophy; this method in philosophy is carried into later times, continuing even through the whole of the Middle Ages. 
 - HoP 2",191.0
9691,"Proclus had several successors who were scholarchs at Athens-Marinus, his biographer, and then Isidorus of Gaza, and finally Damascius. 
 - HoP 2",145.0
9692,"Of the latter we still possess some very interesting writings; he was the last teacher of the Neo-Platonic philosophy in the Academy.

 - HoP 2",81.0
9694,"After some time they ventured to return to the Roman Empire, but they could no longer form any school at Athens; thus as far as its external existence is concerned, the heathen philosophy went utterly to ruin. 
 - HoP 2",219.0
9695,"Eunapius treats of this last period, and Cousin has dealt with it in a short treatise. 
 - HoP 2",96.0
9699,"Here we witness a great revolution, and with this the first period, that of Greek philosophy, closes. 
 - HoP 2",111.0
9700,"The Greek principle is freedom as beauty, reconciliation in imagination, natural free reconciliation that is immediately realized, and thus represents an Idea in sensuous guise. 
 - HoP 2",187.0
9701,"Through philosophy thought, however, desires to tear itself away from what is sensuous, for philosophy is the constitution of thought into a totality beyond the sensuous and the imaginary. 
 - HoP 2",198.0
9702,"Herein is this simple progression contained, and the points of view which we have noticed are, as cursorily surveyed, the following. 
 - HoP 2",142.0
9703,"First of all we saw the abstract in natural form: then abstract thought in its immediacy, and thus the one, Being. 
 - HoP 2",124.0
9704,"These are pure thoughts, but thought is not yet comprehended as thought; for us these thoughts are merely universal thoughts to which the consciousness of thought is still lacking. 
 - HoP 2",190.0
9705,"Socrates is the second stage, in which thought appears as self, the absolute is the thought of itself; the content is not only determined, eg Being, the atom, but is concrete thought, determined in itself and subjective. 
 - HoP 2",230.0
9706,"The self is the most simple form of the concrete, but it is still devoid of content; in as far as it is determined it is concrete, like the Platonic Idea. 
 - HoP 2",164.0
9707,"This content, however, is only implicitly concrete and is not yet known as such; Plato, beginning with what is given, takes the more determinate content out of sensuous perception. 
 - HoP 2",190.0
9708,"Aristotle attains to the highest idea; the thought about thought takes the highest place of all; but the content of the world is still outside of it. 
 - HoP 2",159.0
9709,"Now in as far as this manifold concrete is led back to the self as to the ultimate simple unity of the concrete, or, on the other hand, the abstract principle has content given to it, we saw the systems of dogmatism arising. 
 - HoP 2",234.0
9710,"That thought of thought is in Stoicism the principle of the whole world, and it has made the attempt to comprehend the world as thought. 
 - HoP 2",146.0
9711,"Scepticism, on the other hand, denies all content, for it is self-consciousness, thought, in its pure solitude with itself, and likewise reflection on that beginning of pre-suppositions. 
 - HoP 2",196.0
9712,"In the third place the absolute is known as concrete, and this is as far as Greek philosophy goes. 
 - HoP 2",108.0
9714,"But each sphere is a trinity in itself, so that each of the abstract moments of this triad is itself likewise grasped as a totality. 
 - HoP 2",142.0
9715,"Only that which manifests itself, and therein retains itself as the one, is held to be true. 
 - HoP 2",102.0
9717,"The Neo-Platonic standpoint is thus not a philosophic freak, but a forward advance on the part of the human mind, the world and the world-spirit.

9731,"But in spite of their profound and true speculation, the Neo-Platonists still had not proved their doctrine that the Trinity is the truth, for there is lacking to it the form of inward necessity. 
 - HoP 3",205.0
9733,"Undoubtedly dialectic considerations enter in, in which the opposites which are conceived as absolute are shown to be null; but this dialectic is not methodical, but occurs only disconnectedly.

9737,"Man must be qualified to have this truth present to him; he must further be convinced of this possibility. 
 - HoP 3",116.0
9738,"This is the absolute demand and necessity; the consciousness must be arrived at that this alone is true. 
 - HoP 3",114.0
9741,"Hence the doctrine of reconciliation is that God is known as reconciling Himself with the world, ie as we have seen in the Neo-Platonic philosophy, that He particularizes Himself and does not remain abstract. 
 - HoP 3",218.0
9742,"Not external nature alone, but the whole world pertains to the particular; above all must human individuality know itself in God. 
 - HoP 3",139.0
9743,"The interest of the subject is itself involved, and here it plays an essential rÃ´le in order that God may be realized and may realize Himself in the consciousness of individuals who are spirit and implicitly free. 
 - HoP 3",224.0
9744,"Thus through the process these accomplish that reconciliation in themselves, actualize their freedom; that is to say, they attain to the consciousness of heaven upon earth, the elevation of man to God. 
 - HoP 3",211.0
9745,"Thus the true intellectual world is not a beyond, but the so-called finite is an element in it, and no division exists between this side and that. 
 - HoP 3",156.0
9746,"The real concrete in regard to the absolute Idea is the knowing of the mundane, the other in God, as implicitly divine, as universal, as the world of intellect, as having its root in God, but only the root. 
 - HoP 3",216.0
9747,"In God man is accepted only in his truth, and not in his immediacy, and thus this doctrine is not what we call Pantheism, for that leaves the immediate just as it is. 
 - HoP 3",176.0
9748,"Man then has himself to accomplish the process of reconciliation in himself in order to attain to his truth. 
 - HoP 3",118.0
9749,"We have thus seen that man possesses the determination and attributes of God as the first begotten son, Adam Kadmon, the first man; we may call this unity the concrete Idea, which, however, is still only implicit. 
 - HoP 3",223.0
9753,"The Absolute comprehended as concrete, the unity of these two absolutely different determinations, is the true God; each of them is abstract, and either of them taken by itself is thus not the true God. 
 - HoP 3",212.0
9754,"The fact that the concrete is thus known to men in this perfection as God, brings about the whole revolution that has taken place in the worlds history. 
 - HoP 3",162.0
9755,"The Trinity is thereby not only present in conception, which would not yet constitute the perfect concrete, but actuality is perfectly united to it. 
 - HoP 3",158.0
9756,"In the consciousness of the world it has consequently broken in upon men that the Absolute has attained to this culminating point  of immediate actuality, as Proclus says; and that is the manifestation of Christianity. 
 - HoP 3",228.0
9757,"The Greeks were anthropomorphic, their gods were humanly constituted; but the deficiency in them is that they were not anthropomorphic enough. 
 - HoP 3",152.0
9759,"Thus man reaches this truth, because for him it becomes a sure intuition that in Christ the Î»ÏÎ³Î¿Ï has become Flesh. 
 - HoP 3",130.0
9760,"We thus first have man through this process attaining to spirituality, and in the second place we have man as Christ, in whom this original identity of both natures is known. 
 - HoP 3",184.0
9761,"Now since man really is this process of being the negation of the immediate, and from this negation attaining to himself-to a unity with God-he must consequently renounce his natural will, knowledge, and existence. 
 - HoP 3",224.0
9762,"This giving up of his natural existence is witnessed in Christs sufferings and death, and in His resurrection and elevation to the right hand of the Father. 
 - HoP 3",166.0
9763,"Christ became a perfect man, endured the lot of all men, death; as man He suffered, sacrificed Himself, gave up His natural existence, and thereby elevated Himself above it. 
 - HoP 3",183.0
9765,"Thus what must come to pass in the subject-this process, this conversion of the finite-is known as implicitly accomplished in Christ. 
 - HoP 3",143.0
9766,"This constitutes the great leading Idea of Christianity. 
 - HoP 3",66.0
9767,"From what has been said it follows, in the second place, that the world must not be left in its immediate naturalness. 
 - HoP 3",128.0

 - HoP 3",138.0
9770,"The animal is by nature what it ought to be. 
 - HoP 3",54.0
9774,"Thus consciousness does not signify remaining in the sphere of nature, but the existence of the process whereby the universal becomes object or end to man. 
 - HoP 3",165.0
9775,"Man makes himself divine, but in a spiritual, that is to say not in an immediate way. 
 - HoP 3",95.0
9776,"In the ancient religions the divine is also united to the natural or human; but this unity is no reconciliation, but an immediate, undeveloped, and thus unspiritual unity, just because it is merely natural. 
 - HoP 3",216.0
9777,"But because mind is not natural but only that into which it makes itself, the spiritual is first met with in this very process of producing unity. 
 - HoP 3",156.0
9778,"To this spiritual unity pertains the negation of nature, of the flesh, as that in which man must not rest; for nature is from the beginning evil. 
 - HoP 3",155.0
9779,"Man is likewise naturally evil, for all the wickedness that man does proceeds from a natural desire. 
 - HoP 3",110.0
9780,"Now because man is in himself the image of God, but in existence is only natural, that which is implicit must be evolved, while the first natural condition must be abrogated. 
 - HoP 3",184.0
9783,"In order to bring about the conclusion that this is the historic idea of Christianity, we should have to enter upon an historic disquisition; but because we cannot deal with this here, we must accept it as an historic axiom. 
 - HoP 3",234.0
9785,"In connection with the preceding forms it has been shown that this Idea of Christianity must have now come forth, and indeed become the universal consciousness of the nations. 
 - HoP 3",185.0
9786,"The fact that it has come forth as the world-religion, is the content of history; it is this necessity in the Idea which has to be expounded more clearly in the philosophy of history. 
 - HoP 3",193.0
9788,"The recognition of this necessity has been called the Ã  priori construction of history; there is no good in decrying it as inadmissible, and indeed as arrogant. 
 - HoP 3",171.0
9789,"The development of history may be represented as contingent. 
 - HoP 3",70.0
9790,"Or, if the providence and government of God are seriously accepted, these are represented as though Christianity were so to speak ready made in the mind of God; then, when thrust into the world, it appears to be contingent. 
 - HoP 3",233.0
9791,"But the rationality and likewise the necessity of this decree of Gods has now to be considered, and this may be called a theodicy, a justification of God, ie a vindication of our Idea. 
 - HoP 3",194.0
9793,"It is this which is shown forth in temporal history, and as history, indeed, just because mind is the living movement, proceeding from its immediate existence to beget revolutions in the world, as well as in individuals. 
 - HoP 3",230.0
9794,"Since it is hereby presupposed that this Idea must necessarily become universal religion, there is, in the fourth place, present in it the source of a method of knowledge proper to the particular consciousness. 
 - HoP 3",220.0
9795,"That is to say, the new religion has made the intelligible world of Philosophy the world of common consciousness. 
 - HoP 3",123.0

 - HoP 3",106.0

 - HoP 3",214.0
9806,"But it is again not merely represented that he simply partook of the fruit, but that he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; it is as man that he must partake of it, and not as beast. 
 - HoP 3",207.0
9807,"The fundamental characteristic, however, through which he distinguishes himself from the animal, is the very fact that he knows what good and evil are.

 - HoP 3",206.0
9814,"Now if this appears to come to pass very easily, we must recollect that it is of infinite importance that the reconciliation of the world with itself, the making good, is brought about through the simple method of education. 
 - HoP 3",234.0
9816,"This task once more falls into three separate divisions. 
 - HoP 3",66.0
9817,"In the first place we have the dissemination of the Christian religion and the bringing of it within the hearts of men; this, however, lies outside the limits of our consideration. 
 - HoP 3",190.0
9818,"The heart signifies the subjective man as this, and through this principle the latter has a different position from before; it is essential that this subject should be present. 
 - HoP 3",186.0
9819,"The individual subject is the object of divine grace; each subject, or man as man, has on his own account an infinite value, is destined to partake of this spirit which must, as God, be born within the heart of every man. 
 - HoP 3",231.0
9820,"Man is determined for freedom, he is here recognized as implicitly free; this freedom is, however, at first only formal, because it remains within the principle of subjectivity. 
 - HoP 3",187.0
9822,"For the philosophic Idea is the Idea of God, and thought has the absolute right of reconciliation, or the right to claim that the Christian principle should correspond with thought. 
 - HoP 3",191.0
9824,"We have only here to give the point of view adopted regarding the relation of the Fathers to Philosophy. 
 - HoP 3",114.0
9825,"They for the most part lived within the ancient Roman world and in Latin culture, though the Byzantines likewise are included with them. 
 - HoP 3",146.0
9830,"We must speak of the nature of this corruption. 
 - HoP 3",57.0
9833,"In modern times this elaborately woven system has been entirely pulled to pieces, because men have wished to bring Christianity back to the simple lines of the Word of God as found in the writings of the New Testament. 
 - HoP 3",228.0
9835,"As regards the title of Philosophy and the Fathers to bring Philosophy into Christianity we have the following remarks to make. 
 - HoP 3",137.0
9838,"This must be assented to, and the spirit means none else than the power which dwells within those who apply themselves to the letter in order that they may spiritually apprehend and animate it. 
 - HoP 3",203.0
9839,"This signifies that it is the conceptions which we bring along with us which have in the letter to give efficacy to themselves. 
 - HoP 3",137.0
9840,"Now these reflections brought along with us may be grasped by the most ordinary human understanding, which is what is indicated in modern times when we say that dogmas must be popular. 
 - HoP 3",194.0
9841,"In that way the right to act upon the letter with the spirit is assumed, ie the right to approach it with our individual judgment; but to the Fathers this is forbidden. 
 - HoP 3",178.0
9842,"They did act upon it with the Spirit; and it is expressly said that the Spirit dwells within the Church, directs, teaches, and illuminates it. 
 - HoP 3",152.0
9843,"The Fathers have hence a similar right to relate themselves with the Spirit to the positive, to what is given by the senses. 
 - HoP 3",134.0
9844,"Only it will depend absolutely upon what the nature of the Spirit is, for spirits are very different. 
 - HoP 3",111.0
9845,"The assertion that the spirit must give life to the mere letter is certainly more definitely stated as that spirit has only to expound what is given, ie it must leave the actual sense of what is immediately contained in the words. 
 - HoP 3",240.0
9846,"We must, however, be far behind in culture if we do not see the fallacy in the attitude here adopted. 
 - HoP 3",111.0
9847,"To expound without the individual spirit, as though the sense were one entirely given, is impossible. 
 - HoP 3",111.0
9848,"To elucidate signifies to make clear, and it must be made clear to me; this can be done by nothing excepting what was already present in me. 
 - HoP 3",150.0
9849,"It must be in conformity with my subjective judgment, the necessities of my knowledge, of my apprehension, of my heart, &c; thus only is it for me. 
 - HoP 3",157.0
9850,"We find what we look for, and just because I make it clear to myself, I make my conception, my thought, a factor in it; otherwise it is a dead and external thing, which is not present for me at all. 
 - HoP 3",208.0
9853,"Thus have men made of the Bible what may be called a nose of wax. 
 - HoP 3",75.0
9854,"This man finds this thing, the other man that; what was secure now shows itself as insecure, because it is considered by the subjective spirit. 
 - HoP 3",153.0
9856,"This also is expressly said in the text itself. 
 - HoP 3",57.0
9857,"Christ says: If I depart, I will send the Comforter, the Holy Ghost. 
 - HoP 3",78.0
9858,"He will guide you into all truth,  He-and not Christs earthly presence nor His spoken words. 
 - HoP 3",102.0
9859,"It was only to be after Him, and after His teaching through the text, that the Spirit was to come into the Apostles, and that they were to become full of the Spirit. 
 - HoP 3",175.0
9860,"It might almost be said that when Christianity is carried back to its first appearing, it is brought down to the level of unspirituality, for Christ Himself says that the Spirit will not come until He Himself has departed. 
 - HoP 3",232.0
9862,"His friends have seen Him, heard His doctrine, seen His miracles, and have thereby been brought to believe in Him. 
 - HoP 3",124.0
9863,"But Christ Himself sternly rebukes those who demand miracles of Him; if He thus be made as God to man, God in the heart of man, He cannot have a sensuous and immediate presence. 
 - HoP 3",187.0
9864,"The Dalai-lama, in the form of a sensuous man, is God to the inhabitants of Thibet, but in the Christian principle, where God dwells in the hearts of men, He cannot be present to them in sensuous form. 
 - HoP 3",211.0
9867,"Thus to know what is the principle of Christianity as truth, the truth of the Idea of spirit must be known as concrete spirit, and this is the form peculiar to the Fathers of the Church. 
 - HoP 3",196.0
9868,"With this the idea that the abstractly divine breaks up and has broken up within itself, first began to appear. 
 - HoP 3",121.0
9870,"But it is not sufficient that the concrete moment should be known in God, for the further knowledge is requisite that Christ is an actual present man. 
 - HoP 3",160.0
9871,"This moment of Christs actual present humanity is of immense importance to Christianity, because it is the union of the most tremendous opposites. 
 - HoP 3",156.0
9872,"This higher conception could not have been present in the text, in the first manifestation; the greatness of the Idea could only come in later on, after the Spirit had perfected the Idea. 
 - HoP 3",197.0
9874,"But the fact that it has the significance given by us is known through the Spirit, for the Spirit is revealed in this history. 
 - HoP 3",136.0
9875,"This history is the Notion, the Idea of Spirit itself, and the world-history has in it found its end, which is in this immediate way to know the truth. 
 - HoP 3",161.0
9876,"It is therefore the Spirit which so comprehends that history, and at the time of Pentecost this is shown in an immediate and evident manner. 
 - HoP 3",150.0
9877,"For before this time the Apostles did not know the infinite significance of Christ; they did not yet know that this is the infinite history of God; they had believed in Him, but not yet as seeing in Him this infinite truth. 
 - HoP 3",233.0
9878,"This is the truth which the Fathers developed; the general relation of the first Christian Church to Philosophy is hereby given. 
 - HoP 3",138.0
9880,"These two elements are essentially intermingled in this Christian system, the Idea itself, and secondly the form as it presents itself through its connection with a single individuality present in time and space. 
 - HoP 3",222.0
9881,"To the Fathers this history had thus the Idea as its principle; the true Idea of the Spirit was consequently to them likewise in the determinate form of history. 
 - HoP 3",171.0
9882,"But the Idea was not yet, as such, separated from history; because the Church thus held to this Idea in historic form, it determined the doctrines. 
 - HoP 3",157.0
9883,"This, then, is the general character of the time. 
 - HoP 3",59.0
9884,"From this Idea as comprehended through the Spirit, many so-called heresies arose in the first centuries after Christ. 
 - HoP 3",127.0
9885,"Among such heretics must be included those of the Gnostics who take the Christian literature as their basis, but give a spiritual significance to everything therein present. 
 - HoP 3",183.0
9886,"For they did not remain at this historical form of the Idea of Spirit, since they interpreted the history and deprived it of its historical value. 
 - HoP 3",156.0
9887,"The reflections which they introduced are, as we have seen , to a greater or less extent such as are to be found in the philosophy of the Alexandrians or of Philo. 
 - HoP 3",173.0
9889,"But the form of immediate existence, an essential moment in Christ, is by them etherealized into a universal thought, so that the determination of the individual as a this disappears. 
 - HoP 3",193.0
9890,"The DocetÃ¦, for example, said that Christ had only a phantom body, a phantom life; yet in such assertions thought still constituted the background.

 - HoP 3",119.0
9893,"From the East other forms of opposition in the principles than those we mentioned in connection with the Gnostics have been introduced, namely, Light and Darkness, Good and Evil. 
 - HoP 3",188.0
9894,"But more particularly has this Parsee opposition emerged in ManichÃ¦ism, in which God, as the Light opposes the evil, non-existent , the á½Î»Î·, the material, self-annihilating.

9897,"That is the world-soul ; it was swallowed up by the material, and this intermixture is the basis of the whole creation.

9904,"The captive principle of Light required to be raised from the cycle of metempsychosis to an immediate re-union with the Kingdom of Light. 
 - HoP 3",147.0
9905,"Hence the pure heavenly soul came down to earth and appeared in the semblance of human form in order to reach to the suffering soul  a helping hand. 
 - HoP 3",158.0
9906,"The ManichÃ¦ans also express themselves to the effect that God, the Good, goes forth, illumines, and thus produces an intelligible world. 
 - HoP 3",147.0
9907,"What comes third is Spirit as turning round, establishing the unity of the second and first, and experiencing feeling, and this feeling is Love.

9908,"This heresy fully recognizes the Idea, but does away with the form of individual existence in which the Idea is presented in the Christian religion. 
 - HoP 3",158.0
9909,"The crucifixion of Christ is consequently taken as merely a semblance, as allegorical only, simply an image. 
 - HoP 3",118.0
9910,"That merely phantom crucifixion of the non-suffering Jesus, the fellow-suffering, only imaginary certainly, of the soul unmingled with matter, shows forth the actual suffering of the captive soul. 
 - HoP 3",206.0
9911,"Thus as the forces of Darkness could exercise no power over Christ, they must also show themselves powerless over the soul allied thereto. 
 - HoP 3",148.0
9912,"With the ManichÃ¦ans originates the conception of a Jesus who is crucified in all the world and in the soul; the crucifixion of Christ thus mystically signifies only the wounds of our suffering souls.

9916,"The Church has likewise made a principal point of asserting the unity of the divine and human nature.

10287,"Of this one side is that the Idea is grasped by the heart, if we call the individual man the heart. 
 - HoP 3",109.0

 - HoP 3",195.0
10291,"We may appeal to the human concrete mind; in it we have a living present as thinking and feeling; a concrete content such as this has its root in the thought of man, and constitutes the material for his independent consciousness.

 - HoP 3",138.0
10303,"Michael Balbus, Emperor of Constantinople, had in the year 824 made a present of these works to the Emperor Louis the Pious; Charles the Bald caused them to be translated by Scotus, who long resided at his court. 
 - HoP 3",222.0

 - HoP 3",149.0
10308,"Scotus Erigena sets to work philosophically, expressing himself in the manner of the Neo-Platonists, and not freely, and as from himself. 
 - HoP 3",147.0
10310,"Yet, with Scotus, theology is not yet built on exegesis, and on the authority of the Church; the Church in many cases rejected his writings. 
 - HoP 3",150.0

 - HoP 3",91.0
10317,"The most important and most interesting thoughts which pertain to the scholastics, are, on the one hand, the strife between nominalism and realism; and, on the other, the proof of the existence of God-quite a new manifestation. 
 - HoP 3",237.0
10318,"The efforts of the scholastics were further directed, firstly, to the building up of the dogmas of the Christian Church on metaphysical bases. 
 - HoP 3",152.0
10319,"After this, the collected doctrines of the Church were systematically treated.

 - HoP 3",82.0
10324,"Amongst those who wished to give additional proof of the doctrines of the Church through thought, is Anselm, a man of great distinction and high repute.

10328,"Those others must be shown through reason how irrationally they strive against us. 
 - HoP 3",92.0
10329,"The Christian must go on through faith to reason, and not come from reason to faith; but if he cannot attain to comprehension, he must still less depart from faith.

10332,"Now this is declared to be arrogance; immediate knowledge, faith, is held to be higher than knowledge. 
 - HoP 3",112.0
10333,"But Anselm and the scholastics maintained the opposite view. 
 - HoP 3",70.0
10334,"Anselm may be regarded from this point of view as quite specially the founder of scholastic theology. 
 - HoP 3",111.0
10335,"For the thought of proving through a simple chain of reasoning what was believed-that God exists-left him no rest day and night, and tortured him for long. 
 - HoP 3",165.0
10337,"This is the so-called ontological proof of the existence of God which he set forth, and which made him specially famous. 
 - HoP 3",130.0
10338,"This proof was included among the various proofs up to the time of Kant, and-by some who have not yet reached the Kantian standpoint-it is so included even to the present day. 
 - HoP 3",185.0
10339,"It is different from what we find and read of amongst the ancients. 
 - HoP 3",77.0
10340,"For it was said that God is absolute thought as objective; for because things in the world are contingent, they are not the truth in and for itself-but this is found in the infinite. 
 - HoP 3",192.0
10341,"The scholastics also knew well from the Aristotelian philosophy the metaphysical proposition that potentiality is nothing by itself, but is clearly one with actuality. 
 - HoP 3",177.0
10342,"Later, on the other hand, the opposition between thought itself and Being began to appear with Anselm. 
 - HoP 3",112.0
10344,"But we reach our profoundest depths in bringing the highest opposition into consciousness. 
 - HoP 3",100.0
10345,"Only no advance was made beyond the division as such, although Anselm also tried to find the connection between the sides. 
 - HoP 3",132.0
10347,"Thus if the existence of God is once abandoned as the first hypothesis, and established as a result of thought, self-consciousness is on the way to turn back within itself. 
 - HoP 3",182.0
10349,"The drift of this reasoning is, according to Anselm , as follows: It is one thing to say that a thing is in the understanding, and quite another to perceive that it exists. 
 - HoP 3",182.0
10351,"But that beyond which nothing greater can be thought cannot certainly be in the understanding alone. 
 - HoP 3",110.0
10352,"For if it is accepted as in thought alone, we may go on farther to accept it as existent; that, however, is something greater  than what is merely thought. 
 - HoP 3",165.0
10353,"Thus were that beyond which nothing greater can be thought merely in the understanding, that beyond which nothing greater can be thought would be something beyond which something greater can be thought. 
 - HoP 3",212.0
10354,"But that is truly impossible; there thus without doubt exists both in the understanding and in reality something beyond which nothing greater can be thought. 
 - HoP 3",167.0
10355,"The highest conception cannot be in the understanding alone; it is essential that it should exist. 
 - HoP 3",108.0
10356,"Thus it is made clear that Being is in a superficial way subsumed under the universal of reality, that to this extent Being does not enter into opposition with the Notion. 
 - HoP 3",181.0
10357,"That is quite right; only the transition is not demonstrated-that the subjective understanding abrogates itself. 
 - HoP 3",122.0
10358,"This, however, is just the question which gives the whole interest to the matter. 
 - HoP 3",91.0
10359,"When reality or completion is expressed in such a way that it is not yet posited as existent, it is something thought, and rather opposed to Being than that this is subsumed under it. 
 - HoP 3",193.0
10360,"This mode of arguing held good until the time of Kant; and we see in it the endeavour to apprehend the doctrine of the Church through reason. 
 - HoP 3",151.0
10361,"This opposition between Being and thought is the starting point in philosophy, the absolute that contains the two opposites within itself-a conception, according to Spinoza, which involves its existence likewise. 
 - HoP 3",222.0
10362,"Of Anselm it is however to be remarked that the formal logical mode of the understanding, the process of scholastic reasoning is to be found in him, the content indeed is right, but the form faulty. 
 - HoP 3",208.0
10363,"For in the first place the expression the thought of a Highest  is assumed as the prius. 
 - HoP 3",98.0
10364,"Secondly, there are two sorts of objects of thought-one that is and another that is not; the object that is only thought and does not exist, is as imperfect as that which only is without being thought.

10922,"But in his writings there are two specially marked features. 
 - HoP 3",70.0
10923,"The first is the nature of his system, based as it is on his leading thoughts, or his philosophic principles generally, namely the Idea as substantial unity. 
 - HoP 3",167.0
10925,"His philosophic thoughts, to express which he sometimes made use of Aristotles concepts, give evidence of a peculiar, highly strung and very original mind. 
 - HoP 3",165.0
10926,"The substance of his general reflections is found in the greatest enthusiasm for the above-mentioned vitality of Nature, divinity, the presence of reason in nature. 
 - HoP 3",174.0
10927,"His philosophy is thus on the whole certainly Spinozism, Pantheism. 
 - HoP 3",77.0
10929,"In his conception of things the main points are that, on the one hand, he gives the universal determination of matter, and, on the other hand, that of form. 
 - HoP 3",166.0
10931,"It is the artist within, who shapes and forms the material without. 
 - HoP 3",77.0
10932,"From within the root or the seed-grain it makes the shoot come forth; from this again it brings the branches, and from them the twigs, and from out of the twigs it calls forth the buds, and leaves, and flowers. 
 - HoP 3",220.0
10933,"All is planned, prepared and perfected within. 
 - HoP 3",56.0
10934,"In the same way this universal reason within calls back their saps from the fruits and blossoms to the twigs, and so on. 
 - HoP 3",130.0
10935,"The universe is thus an infinite animal, in which all things live and move and have their being in modes the most diverse. 
 - HoP 3",132.0
10936,"The formal understanding is thus in no wise different from the Final Cause ; but these are just as truly also active understanding, the efficient cause , this same producing force. 
 - HoP 3",190.0
10938,"The understanding working towards one particular end is the inward form of the thing itself, an inward principle of the understanding. 
 - HoP 3",144.0
10939,"What is continually produced is in accordance with this form, and contained within it; what appears is determined as the form is in itself determined. 
 - HoP 3",160.0
10941,"In dealing with Kants philosophy we shall have again to mention this determination of final purpose. 
 - HoP 3",110.0
10944,"To a certain extent Bruno distinguishes form and matter in substance, which itself, as the aforesaid activity of the Idea, is the unity of form and matter; thus matter has life in itself. 
 - HoP 3",197.0
10945,"The permanent element in the endless changes of existence is, he says, the first and absolute matter; although without form, it is nevertheless the mother of all forms, and receptive of all forms. 
 - HoP 3",206.0
10946,"Because matter is not without the first universal form, it is itself principle or in itself final cause. 
 - HoP 3",114.0
10947,"Form is immanent in matter; the one simply cannot exist without the other; thus matter itself brings about these changes of form, and the same matter runs through them all. 
 - HoP 3",182.0
10948,"What was at first seed becomes blade, then ear, then bread, chyle, blood, seed of animal, an embryo, a human being, a corpse, then once more earth, stone, or other substance; from sand and water frogs are produced. 
 - HoP 3",224.0
10949,"Here then we can perceive something which, although it transforms itself into all these things in turn, yet still in itself remains one and the same. 
 - HoP 3",159.0
10950,"This matter cannot be a body, for bodies have form; nor can it belong to the class which we term properties, attributes, or qualities, for these are liable to change. 
 - HoP 3",176.0
10951,"Thus nothing seems to be eternal and worthy of the name of a principle, except matter. 
 - HoP 3",96.0
10952,"Many have for this reason held matter to be the only reality, and all forms to be accidental. 
 - HoP 3",103.0
10953,"This error arises from the fact of their recognizing only a form of the second kind, and not that necessary first and eternal form, which is the form and source of all forms. 
 - HoP 3",184.0
10954,"In the same way the aforesaid matter, on account of its identity with the understanding which causes form beforehand, is itself intelligible, as the universal presupposition of all corporeality. 
 - HoP 3",204.0
10955,"Because it is everything in general, it is nothing in particular, neither air nor water, nor anything else, abstract or otherwise; it has no dimensions, in order to have all dimensions. 
 - HoP 3",195.0
10956,"The forms of matter are the inward power of matter itself; it is, as intelligible, the very totality of form. 
 - HoP 3",119.0
10957,"This system of Brunos is thus objective Spinozism, and nothing else; one can see how deeply he penetrated. 
 - HoP 3",116.0
10959,"The passivity of matter must be regarded as pure and absolute. 
 - HoP 3",72.0
10960,"Now it is impossible to attribute existence to a thing which lacks the power to exist. 
 - HoP 3",96.0
10961,"Existence has, however, such an express reference to the active mode, that it is at once clear that the one cannot exist without the other, but that each of them presupposes the other. 
 - HoP 3",194.0
10962,"If therefore at all times a capacity of working, producing, creating, was there, so must there also have been at all times a capacity of being worked upon, produced, created. 
 - HoP 3",184.0
10963,"The perfect potentiality of the existence of things  cannot precede their actual existence, and just as little can it remain after that is past. 
 - HoP 3",154.0
10964,"The first and most perfect principle includes all existence in itself, can be all things, and is all things. 
 - HoP 3",118.0
10965,"Active power and potentiality, possibility and actuality are therefore in it one undivided and indivisible principle. 
 - HoP 3",127.0
10966,"This simultaneousness of acting and being acted upon is a very important determination; matter is nothing without activity, form is therefore the power and inward life of matter. 
 - HoP 3",188.0
10968,"Thus the Absolute is determined for Bruno: it is not so with other things, which may exist and also may not exist, and which may be determined in one way or in another way. 
 - HoP 3",182.0
10969,"In regard to finite things and in finite determinations of the understanding the distinction between form and matter is thus present. 
 - HoP 3",143.0
10970,"The individual man is at every moment what he may be at that moment, but not everything which he may be in general and with reference to substance. 
 - HoP 3",157.0
10971,"The things which appear to be different are only modifications of one single thing which includes in its existence all other existence. 
 - HoP 3",145.0
10972,"The universe, unbegotten Nature, is, however, everything which it can be in reality and at one time, because it includes in itself the whole of matter, as well as the eternal, unchangeable form of its changing forms. 
 - HoP 3",226.0
10974,"Thus Bruno wrote also a book, De umbris idearum. 
 - HoP 3",58.0
10975,"This is Brunos fundamental idea. 
 - HoP 3",42.0
10976,"He says: To recognize this unity of form and matter in all things, is what reason is striving to attain to. 
 - HoP 3",117.0
10977,"But in order to penetrate to this unity, in order to investigate all the secrets of Nature, we must search into the opposed and contradictory extremes of things, the maximum and the minimum. 
 - HoP 3",200.0
10978,"It is in these very extremes that they are intelligible, and become united in the Notion; and this union of them is infinite Nature. 
 - HoP 3",142.0
10979,"To find the point of union is not the greatest matter; but to develop from the same its very opposite, this is the real and the deepest secret of the art. 
 - HoP 3",164.0
10980,"It is saying much if we speak of knowing the development of the Idea as a necessity of determinations; we shall see later how Bruno proceeded to do this. 
 - HoP 3",163.0
10981,"He represents the original principle, which is elsewhere known as the form, under the Notion of the minimum, which is at the same time the maximum-One, which at the same time is All; the universe is this One in All. 
 - HoP 3",225.0
10982,"In the universe, he says, the body is not distinguished from the point, nor the centre from the circumference, nor the finite from the infinite, nor the maximum from the minimum. 
 - HoP 3",188.0
10983,"There is nothing but centre point; or the centre point is everywhere and in everything. 
 - HoP 3",97.0
10984,"The ancients expressed the same by saying of the Father of the gods, that he really had his dwelling-place in every point of the universe. 
 - HoP 3",148.0
10985,"It is the universe that first gives to things true reality; it is the substance of all things, the monad, the atom, the spirit poured out on all things, the innermost essence, the pure form. 
 - HoP 3",200.0
10986,"The second object to which Bruno devoted himself was the so-called Lullian Art, which received its name from its first inventor, the Scholastic Raymundus Lullus. 
 - HoP 3",171.0
10987,"Bruno adopted this and carried it to completion; he termed it also his ars combinatoria. 
 - HoP 3",98.0
10989,"But the Topics of Aristotle did this in order to apprehend and determine an object in its various aspects, while Bruno rather worked for the sake of lightening the task of memory. 
 - HoP 3",189.0
10990,"He thus really connected the Lullian Art with the art of mnemonics as practised by the ancients, which has come into notice again in recent times, and which will be found described in greater detail in the Auctor ad Herennium. 
 - HoP 3",236.0
10992,"In this way when we repeat it, we have not to say it from memory or out of our head, as we are accustomed to do, but we have only to read it off as if from a table. 
 - HoP 3",174.0
10993,"The only difficulty lies in making some ingenious connection between the content in question and the picture; that gives rise to the most unholy combinations, and the art is therefore not one to be commended. 
 - HoP 3",218.0
10994,"Bruno also soon abandoned it, since what had been a matter of memory became a matter of imagination; which was, of course, a descent. 
 - HoP 3",143.0

11004,"Brunos great endeavour is really now to apprehend and demonstrate the modes of organizing this active understanding. 
 - HoP 3",126.0
11005,"This is presented more in detail as follows: To the pure truth itself, the absolute light, man approaches only; his Being is not absolute Being itself, which alone is the One and First.

 - HoP 3",178.0
11020,"Imperfection, evil, ugliness, do not rest upon special ideas of their own; they become known in another conception, not in one peculiar to themselves, which is nothing.

11021,"For this that is peculiarly theirs is the non-existent in the existent, the defect in the effect.

 - HoP 3",218.0
11054,"The idea is on the whole praiseworthy compared with the fragmentariness of Aristotle and the Scholastics, according to whom every determination is fixed once for all. 
 - HoP 3",176.0
11056,"It is a great beginning, to have the thought of unity; and the other point is this attempt to grasp the universe in its development, in the system of its determinations, and to show how the outward appearance is a symbol of ideas.

 - HoP 3",120.0
11059,"He has many points of similarity with Bruno, and, like him, he suffered as a martyr on account of philosophy; for he shared Brunos fate, which was to be burned at the stake.

11066,"Franconus, his accuser, stated on oath that Vanini had uttered blasphemies. 
 - HoP 3",85.0
11068,"But it was of no avail; in 1619 at Toulouse in France he was condemned to the stake, and before the carrying out of this sentence his tongue was torn out by the executioner. 
 - HoP 3",183.0
11069,"How the case was proved against him is not, however, clear; the proceedings seem to have been in great part due to personal enmity, and to the zeal for persecution which filled the clergy in Toulouse. 
 - HoP 3",210.0
11070,"In him we see reason and philosophy taking a direction hostile to theology, while Scholastic philosophy went hand in hand with theology, and theology was supposed to be confirmed thereby.

11071,"Art developed in the Catholic Church, but free thought broke off from, and remained alien to it. 
 - HoP 3",106.0

 - HoP 3",133.0
11073,"Vaninis philosophy does not go very far; he admires the living energy of Nature; his reasonings were not deep, but were more of the nature of fanciful ideas.

11081,"What one finds is assurances from him that he would believe this or that doctrine if he had not received Christian teaching. 
 - HoP 3",134.0
11082,"Vaninis tendency, however, was towards naturalism; he showed that it is Nature that is the Deity, that all things had a mechanical genesis. 
 - HoP 3",149.0
11083,"He therefore explained the whole universe in its connection by efficient causes alone, not by final causes; but the statement of this is made in such a way that the writer does not give it as his own conclusion.

11087,"In this fashion all possible arguments were advanced against the Church.

 - HoP 3",196.0
11092,"Among his arguments are the following: It was against the will of God that Adam and Eve sinned, and thus brought the whole human race to ruin : Christ also was crucified by the powers of darkness.

 - HoP 3",236.0
11110,"This opposition had a different meaning in former times from what it bears now-a-days; the earlier meaning is this, that faith is the doctrine of Christianity, which is given as truth, and by which as truth man has to remain. 
 - HoP 3",235.0
11111,"We have here faith in this content, and opposed to this stands conviction by means of reason. 
 - HoP 3",103.0
11112,"But now this faith is transferred into the thinking consciousness itself; it is a relation of self-consciousness itself to the facts which it finds within itself, not to the objective content of the doctrine.

 - HoP 3",181.0
11310,"Evil is plainly the other,  the negation of God as Holiness; because He is, because He is wise, good, and at the same time almighty, evil is contradictory to Him; an endeavour is made to reconcile this contradiction.

11327,"The second stage is the metaphysical union; and here, with Descartes, the philosophy of modern times as abstract thought properly speaking begins. 
 - HoP 3",156.0
11328,"Thinking understanding seeks to bring to pass the union, inasmuch as it investigates with its pure thought-determinations; this is in the first place the standpoint of metaphysics as such.

11329,"In the second place, we have to consider negation, the destruction of this metaphysics-the attempt to consider knowledge on its own account, and the determinations which proceed from it.

11330,"The third stage is that this union itself which is to be brought about, and which is the only subject of interest, comes to consciousness and becomes an object.

11428,"In every science principles are commenced with; at the first these are the results of the particular, but if the science is completed they are made the beginning. 
 - HoP 3",172.0
11429,"The case is similar with Philosophy; the working out of the empirical side has really become the conditioning of the Idea, so that this last may reach its full development and determination. 
 - HoP 3",200.0
11432,"We must not overlook the fact that Philosophy would not have come into existence without this process, for mind is essentially a working upon something different. 
 - HoP 3",172.0
11433,"Bacons fame rests on two works. 
 - HoP 3",41.0
11434,"In the first place, he has the merit of having in his work De augmentis scientiarum presented to us a systematic encyclopedia of the sciences, an outline which must undoubtedly have caused a sensation amongst his contemporaries. 
 - HoP 3",238.0
11435,"It is important to set before mens eyes a well arranged picture such as this of the whole, when that whole has not been grasped in thought. 
 - HoP 3",149.0
11436,"This encyclopedia gives a general classification of the sciences; the principles of the classification are regulated in accordance with the differences in the intellectual capacities. 
 - HoP 3",193.0
11437,"Bacon thus divides human learning according to the faculties of memory, imagination, and reason, for he distinguishes what pertains  to memory;  to imagination;  to reason. 
 - HoP 3",182.0
11438,"Under memory he considered history; under imagination, poetry, and art; and finally, under reason, philosophy. 
 - HoP 3",120.0
11439,"To history belong the works of God-sacred, prophetic, ecclesiastical history; the works of men-civil and literary history; and likewise the works of nature, and so on. 
 - HoP 3",177.0
11440,"Thus, in treating of Cosmetica, he says in regard to paint that He is surprised that this depraved custom of painting has been by the penal laws both ecclesiastical and civil so long overlooked. 
 - HoP 3",204.0
11441,"In the Bible we read indeed of Jezebel that she painted her face; but nothing of the kind is said of Esther or Judith. 
 - HoP 3",128.0
11442,"As formerly in civil laws-those respecting marriage, for instance-the Jewish forms held good, in Philosophy, too, the same are still to be found. 
 - HoP 3",155.0
11443,"In this work theology likewise appears, as also magic; there is contained in it a comprehensive system of knowledge and of the sciences. 
 - HoP 3",146.0
11444,"The arrangement of the sciences is the least significant part of the work De augmentis scientiarum. 
 - HoP 3",109.0
11446,"As it was with the Schoolmen and with the ancients, this classification is still the mode adopted in the sciences, in which the nature of knowledge is unknown. 
 - HoP 3",169.0
11447,"In them the idea of the science is advanced beforehand, and to this idea a principle foreign to it is added, as a basis of division, just as here is added the distinction between memory, imagination and reason. 
 - HoP 3",220.0
11448,"The true method of division is found in the self-division of the Notion, its separating itself from itself. 
 - HoP 3",117.0
11449,"In knowledge the moment of self-consciousness is undoubtedly found, and the real self-consciousness has in it the moments of memory, imagination and reason. 
 - HoP 3",166.0
11450,"But this division is certainly not taken from the Notion of self-consciousness, but from experience, in which self-consciousness finds itself possessed of these capacities. 
 - HoP 3",182.0
11451,"The other remarkable feature in Bacon is that in his second work, his Organon, he sought at great length to establish a new method in learning; in this regard his name is still held greatly in honour by many. 
 - HoP 3",218.0
11452,"What chiefly distinguishes his system is his polemical attitude towards scholastic methods as they had hitherto existed, towards syllogistic forms. 
 - HoP 3",157.0
11453,"He calls these methods anticipationes naturÃ¦; in them men begin with presuppositions, definitions, accepted ideas, with a scholastic abstraction, and reason further from these without regarding that which is present in actuality. 
 - HoP 3",240.0
11455,"It was against this a priori method that Bacon directed his polemic; as against these anticipations of nature he called attention to the explanation, the interpretation of nature. 
 - HoP 3",189.0
11456,"For the sense in its primary objects at once apprehends the appearance of the object, and consents to the truth thereof. 
 - HoP 3",130.0
11457,"As a matter of fact, this Aristotelian deduction is not a knowledge through itself in accordance with its content: it requires a foreign universal as its basis, and for that reason its movement is in its form contingent. 
 - HoP 3",230.0
11458,"The content is not in unity with the form, and this form is hence in itself contingent, because it, considered on its own account, is the movement onwards in a foreign content. 
 - HoP 3",186.0
11459,"The major premise is the content existent for itself, the minor is likewise the content not through itself, for it goes back into the infinite, ie it has not the form in itself; the form is not the content. 
 - HoP 3",216.0
11460,"The opposite may always be made out equally well through the syllogism, for it is a matter of indifference to this form what content is made its basis. 
 - HoP 3",161.0
11461,"Dialectic does not assist in the discovery of the arts; many arts were found out by chance. 
 - HoP 3",101.0
11462,"He demanded that observations on nature and experiments should be made fundamental, and pointed out the objects whose investigation was of special importance in the interests of human society, and so on. 
 - HoP 3",213.0
11463,"From this there then resulted the establishment of conclusions through induction and analogy. 
 - HoP 3",103.0
11465,"Thus when Bacon set up induction in opposition to the syllogism, this opposition is formal; each induction is also a deduction, which fact was known even to Aristotle. 
 - HoP 3",177.0
11467,"That is a perfect syllogism. 
 - HoP 3",38.0
11468,"Induction always signifies that observations are instituted, experiments made, experience regarded, and from this the universal determination is derived. 
 - HoP 3",163.0
11469,"We have already called to mind how important it is to lead on to the content as the content of actuality, of the present; for the rational must have objective truth. 
 - HoP 3",175.0
11470,"The reconciliation of spirit with the world, the glorification of nature and of all actuality, must not be a Beyond, a Futurity, but must be accomplished now and here.

11475,"Man does not stop short at the individual, nor can he do so. 
 - HoP 3",70.0
11476,"He seeks the universal, but thoughts, even if not Notions likewise, are what constitute the same. 
 - HoP 3",107.0
11477,"The most remarkable thought-form is that of force; we thus speak of the force of electricity, of magnetism, of gravity. 
 - HoP 3",129.0
11478,"Force, however, is a universal and not a perceptible; quite uncritically and unconsciously the empiricists thus permit of determinations such as these. 
 - HoP 3",161.0
11479,"Bacon finally gives the objects with which Philosophy mainly has to deal. 
 - HoP 3",83.0
11480,"These objects contrast much with that which we derive from perception and experience. 
 - HoP 3",95.0
11482,"He complains that such investigations have been neglected by those whom he designates ignavi regionum exploratores. 
 - HoP 3",125.0

 - HoP 3",100.0

 - HoP 3",84.0
11489,"The former constitutes metaphysics; the latter physics. 
 - HoP 3",65.0
11491,"And causes, again, are not improperly distributed into four kinds: the material, the formal, the efficient, and the final. 
 - HoP 3",132.0
11492,"The investigation of final causes is useless; they corrupt rather than advance the sciences except such as have to do with human action. 
 - HoP 3",146.0
11494,"According to Bacon this has been worked out in innumerable different ways. 
 - HoP 3",84.0
11495,"The negative and external side of utility is turned round, and the lack of this adaptation to end is likewise drawn within the same embrace. 
 - HoP 3",150.0
11496,"It may, for example, be said that if sun or moon were to shine at all times, the police might save much money, and this would provide men with food and drink for whole months together. 
 - HoP 3",194.0
11497,"It was right that Bacon should set himself to oppose this investigation into final causes, because it relates to external expediency, just as Kant was right in distinguishing the inward teleology from the outward. 
 - HoP 3",223.0
11498,"As against the external end, there is, in fact, the inward end, ie the inward Notion of the thing itself, as we found it earlier in Aristotle. 
 - HoP 3",152.0
11500,"Speaking generally, the Notion of nature is not in nature itself, which would mean that the end was in nature itself; but as teleological, the Notion is something foreign to it. 
 - HoP 3",187.0
11501,"It does not have the end in itself in such a way that we have to accord respect to it-as the individual man has his end in himself and hence has to be respected. 
 - HoP 3",171.0
11502,"But even the individual man as individual has only a right to respect from the individual as such, and not from the universal. 
 - HoP 3",136.0
11503,"He who acts in the name of the universal, of the state, as a general does for instance, does not require to respect the individual at all; for the latter, although an end in himself, does not cease to be relative. 
 - HoP 3",223.0
11504,"He is this end in himself, not as excluding himself and setting himself in opposition, but only in so far as his true reality is the universal Notion. 
 - HoP 3",160.0
11505,"The end of the animal in itself as an individual is its own self-preservation; but its true end in itself is the species. 
 - HoP 3",131.0
11506,"Its self-preservation is not involved in this; for the self-preservation of its individuality is disadvantageous to the species, while the abrogation of itself is favourable thereto. 
 - HoP 3",192.0
11507,"Now Bacon separates the universal principle and the efficient cause, and for that reason he removes investigation into ends from physics to metaphysics. 
 - HoP 3",162.0
11509,"Bacon has thus made investigation into the efficient cause more general, and he asserts that this investigation alone belongs to physics, although he allows that both kinds of investigation may exist side by side. 
 - HoP 3",223.0
11512,"This polemic of Bacons against spectres, astrology, magic, &c,112 can certainly not be regarded exactly as Philosophy like his other reflections, but it is at least of service to culture. 
 - HoP 3",197.0
11513,"He also advises that attention should be directed to formal causes, the forms of things, and that they should be recognized. 
 - HoP 3",134.0
11514,"But to give an exact definition of the meaning which Bacon attaches to the phrase formal causes is rather difficult; because his language upon this subject is uncertain in a very remarkable degree. 
 - HoP 3",207.0
11516,"The efficient and the material  are but slight and superficial, and contribute little, if anything, to true and active science. 
 - HoP 3",137.0
11518,"And it is this law, with its clauses, that I mean when I speak of Forms.

11637,"This great salitter is the unrevealed existence, just as the Neo-Platonic unity is without knowledge of itself and likewise unrecognized. 
 - HoP 3",147.0
11638,"This first substance contains all powers or qualities as not yet separated; thus this salitter likewise appears as the body of God, who embraces all qualities in Himself. 
 - HoP 3",180.0
11639,"Quality thus becomes an important conception, the first determination with Boehme; and he begins with qualities in his work MorgenrÃ¶the im Aufgang. 
 - HoP 3",158.0
11640,"He afterwards associates with this the conferring of quality, and in the same place says: Quality is the mobility, boiling, springing, and driving of a thing. 
 - HoP 3",168.0
11641,"These qualities he then tries to define, but the account he gives of them is vague. 
 - HoP 3",93.0
11642,"As for example heat which burns, consumes and drives forth all whatsoever comes into it which is not of the same property; and again it enlightens and warms all cold, wet, and dark things; it compacts and hardens soft things. 
 - HoP 3",235.0
11643,"It contains likewise two other kinds in it, namely Light and Fierceness  ; of which the light or the heart of the heat is in itself a pleasant, joyful glance or lustre, a power of life. 
 - HoP 3",195.0
11644,"For it makes all things in this world living and moving; all flesh, trees, leaves, and grass grow in this world, as in the power of the light, and have their light therein, viz. 
 - HoP 3",187.0
11645,"Again, it contains also a fierceness or wrath which burns, consumes and spoils. 
 - HoP 3",89.0
11646,"This wrath or fierceness springs, drives, and elevates itself in the light, and makes the light movable. 
 - HoP 3",114.0
11647,"It wrestles and fights together in its two-fold source. 
 - HoP 3",65.0
11648,"The light subsists in God without heat, but it does not subsist so in nature. 
 - HoP 3",87.0
11649,"For all qualities in nature are one in another, in the same manner as God is all. 
 - HoP 3",91.0
11650,"For God   is the Heart. 
 - HoP 3",33.0
11651,"On another occasion  the Son is the heart of God; and yet again the Spirit is called the heart  or fountain of nature, and from Him comes all. 
 - HoP 3",152.0
11652,"Now heat reigns and predominates in all powers in nature and warms all, and is one source or spring in all. 
 - HoP 3",117.0
11653,"But the light in the heat gives power to all qualities, for that all grow pleasant and joyful. 
 - HoP 3",104.0
11655,"All the creatures are made from these qualities, and live therein as in their mother. 
 - HoP 3",95.0
11656,"The virtues of the stars are nature itself. 
 - HoP 3",53.0
11657,"Everything in this world proceeds from the stars. 
 - HoP 3",59.0
11658,"That I shall prove to you if you are not a blockhead and have a little reason. 
 - HoP 3",88.0
11660,"And all things are formed from these same powers and remain eternally therein. 
 - HoP 3",88.0
11661,"Thus it is said that God is the reality of all realities. 
 - HoP 3",67.0
11663,"You must not conceive that in the Body of the stars is the whole triumphing Holy Trinity, God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. 
 - HoP 3",136.0
11664,"But we must not so conceive as if God was not at all in the Corpus or Body of the stars, and in this world. 
 - HoP 3",117.0
11667,"Boehme further defines God the Father as follows: When we consider the whole nature and its property, then we see the Father: when we behold heaven and the stars, then we behold His eternal power and wisdom. 
 - HoP 3",217.0
11668,"So many stars as stand in the whole heaven, which are innumerable, so manifold and various is the power and wisdom of God the Father. 
 - HoP 3",143.0
11669,"Every star differs in its quality. 
 - HoP 3",44.0
11670,"But you must not conceive here that every power which is in the Father stands in a peculiar severed or divided part and place in the Father, as the stars do in heaven. 
 - HoP 3",177.0
11671,"No, but the Spirit shows that all the powers in the Father,  as the fountainhead, are one in another as one power. 
 - HoP 3",124.0
11672,"This whole is the universal power which exists as God the Father, wherein all differences are united; creaturely  it, however, exists as the totality of stars, and thus as separation into the different qualities. 
 - HoP 3",222.0
11674,"No, the Father is not so, but He is an All-mighty, All-wise, All-knowing, All-seeing, All-hearing, All-smelling, All-tasting God, who in Himself is meek, friendly, gracious, merciful, and full of joy, yea Joy itself. 
 - HoP 3",226.0
11675,"Since Boehme calls the Father all powers, he again distinguishes these as the seven first originating spirits. 
 - HoP 3",120.0
11676,"But there is a certain confusion in this and no thought-determination, no definite reason for there being exactly seven-such precision and certainty is not to be found in Boehme. 
 - HoP 3",188.0
11677,"These seven qualities are likewise the seven planets which move and work in the great Salitter of God; the seven planets signify the seven spirits of God or the princes of the angels. 
 - HoP 3",193.0
11678,"But they are in the Father as one unity, and this unity is an inward spring and fermentation. 
 - HoP 3",103.0
11679,"In God all spirits triumph as one spirit, and a spirit ever calms and loves the others, and nothing exists excepting mere joy and rapture. 
 - HoP 3",148.0
11680,"One spirit does not stand alongside the others like stars in heaven, for all seven are contained within one another as one spirit. 
 - HoP 3",140.0
11681,"Each spirit in the seven spirits of God is pregnant with all seven spirits of God;  thus each is in God itself a totality. 
 - HoP 3",132.0
11682,"One brings forth the other in and through itself;  this is the flashing forth of the life of all qualities. 
 - HoP 3",117.0
11683,"As what came first was the source and germ of all powers and qualities, what comes second is process. 
 - HoP 3",111.0
11684,"This second principle is a very important conception, which with Boehme appears under very many aspects and forms, viz. 
 - HoP 3",129.0
11685,"God as the simple absolute existence is not God absolutely; in Him nothing can be known. 
 - HoP 3",98.0
11686,"What we know is something different-but this different  is itself contained in God as the perception and knowledge of God. 
 - HoP 3",132.0
11687,"Hence of the second step Boehme says that a separation must have taken place in this temperament. 
 - HoP 3",107.0
11688,"No thing can become manifest to itself without opposition; for if it has nothing to withstand it, it always goes forward on its own account and does not go back within itself. 
 - HoP 3",185.0
11689,"But if it does not go back into itself as into that from which it originally arose, it knows nothing of its original state. 
 - HoP 3",133.0
11690,"Original state Urstand he makes use of for substance; and it is a pity that we cannot use this and many other striking expressions. 
 - HoP 3",141.0
11691,"Without adversity life would have no sensibility nor will nor efficacy, neither understanding nor science. 
 - HoP 3",116.0
11693,"The Word is the eternal beginning and remains so eternally, for it is the revelation of the eternal One through and by which the divine power is brought into one knowledge of somewhat. 
 - HoP 3",194.0
11694,"By the Word we understand the revealed will of God: by the Word we mean God the hidden God, from whom the Word eternally springs forth. 
 - HoP 3",145.0
11695,"The Word is the efflux of the divine One, and yet God Himself as His revelation. 
 - HoP 3",90.0
11696,"ÎÏÎ³Î¿Ï is more definite than Word, and there is a delightful double significance in the Greek expression indicating as it does both reason and speech. 
 - HoP 3",164.0
11697,"For speech is the pure existence of spirit; it is a thing which when once heard goes back within itself. 
 - HoP 3",114.0
11698,"What has flowed out is wisdom, beginning and cause of all powers, colours, virtue and qualities. 
 - HoP 3",106.0
11699,"Of the Son Boehme says: The Son is  of the Father and in the Father, the heart of the Father or light, and the Father beareth him ever, from eternity to eternity. 
 - HoP 3",172.0
11700,"Thus the Son is  indeed another Person from the Father, though no other,  but the same God as the Father,  whose image he is. 
 - HoP 3",135.0
11702,"From the Son the eternal joy rises and springs in all the powers of the Father, as the sun does in the heart of the stars. 
 - HoP 3",132.0
11704,"The Son of God is continually generated from all the powers of his Father from eternity, just as the sun is born of the stars; He is ever born and is not made, and is the heart and lustre shining forth from all powers. 
 - HoP 3",228.0
11705,"He shines in all powers of the Father, and his power is the moving, springing joy in all the powers of the Father, and shines in the whole Father as the sun does in the whole world. 
 - HoP 3",191.0
11706,"For if the Son did not shine in the Father, the Father would be a dark valley; for the Fathers power would not rise from eternity to eternity, and so the divine Being would not subsist. 
 - HoP 3",195.0
11707,"This life of the Son is an important matter; and in regard to this issuing forth and manifestation Boehme has likewise brought forward the most important assertions. 
 - HoP 3",175.0
11708,"From such a revelation of powers in which the will of the eternal One contemplates itself, flows the understanding and the knowledge of the something Ichts, since the eternal will contemplates itself in the something Ichts. 
 - HoP 3",233.0
11709,"Ichts  is a play upon the word Nichts  , for it is simply the negative; yet it is at the same time the opposite of nothing, since the Ich  of self-consciousness is contained in it. 
 - HoP 3",190.0
11710,"The Son, the something, is thus I,  consciousness, self-consciousness: God is not only the abstract neutral but likewise the gathering together of Himself into the point of Being-for-self. 
 - HoP 3",198.0
11711,"The other  of God is thus the image of God. 
 - HoP 3",53.0
11712,"This similitude is the Mysterium magnum, viz. 
 - HoP 3",55.0
11713,"This separator is constituted the steward of nature, by whom the eternal will rules, makes, forms and constitutes all things. 
 - HoP 3",135.0
11714,"The separator is effectuating and self-differentiating, and Boehme calls this Ichts,  likewise Lucifer, the first-born Son of God, the creaturely first-born angel who was one of the seven spirits. 
 - HoP 3",206.0
11715,"But this Lucifer has fallen and Christ has come in his place. 
 - HoP 3",71.0
11716,"This is the connection of the devil with God, namely other-Being and then Being-for-self or Being-for-one, in such a way that the other is for one; and this is the origin of evil in God and out of God. 
 - HoP 3",211.0
11717,"This is the furthest point of thought reached by Jacob Boehme. 
 - HoP 3",72.0
11718,"He represents this Fall of Lucifer as that the Ichts,  ie self-knowledge, the I  Ichheit , the inward imagining of self, the inward fashioning of self , is the fire which absorbs all things. 
 - HoP 3",200.0
11719,"This is the negative side in the separator, the anguish; or it is the wrath of God. 
 - HoP 3",93.0
11720,"This divine wrath is hell and the devil, who through himself imagines himself into himself. 
 - HoP 3",101.0
11721,"This is very bold and speculative; Boehme here seeks to show in God Himself the sources of the divine anger. 
 - HoP 3",118.0
11722,"He also calls the will of the something Ichts  self-hood; it is the passing over of the something Ichts  into the nothing Nichts, the I  imagining itself within itself. 
 - HoP 3",178.0
11723,"He says: Heaven and hell are as far removed from one another as day and night, as something and nothing. 
 - HoP 3",114.0
11724,"Boehme has really here penetrated into the utmost depths of divine essence; evil, matter, or whatever it has been called, is the I = I, the Being-for-self, the true negativity. 
 - HoP 3",186.0
11725,"Before this it was the nonens which is itself positive, the darkness; but the true negativity is the I. 
 - HoP 3",113.0
11726,"It is not anything bad because it is called the evil; it is in mind alone that evil exists, because it is conceived therein as it is in itself. 
 - HoP 3",153.0
11728,"Boehme in his own way sets forth the form further assumed in this process in a pictorial manner. 
 - HoP 3",106.0
11729,"This Separator deduces qualities from itself, from which the infinite manifold arises, and through which the eternal One makes itself perceptible   not according to the unity, but in accordance with the efflux of the unity. 
 - HoP 3",233.0
11730,"Implicit Being and the manifold are absolutely opposed through the Notion, which Boehme did not have: Being-for-self implies Being-for-another and retrogression into the opposite. 
 - HoP 3",189.0
11731,"Boehme sways backwards and forwards in apparent contradictions, and does not well know how to find a way out of the difficulty. 
 - HoP 3",137.0
11733,"This is the return to the One. 
 - HoP 3",40.0
11734,"Thereby   the eternal power becomes desirous and effectual and   is the original condition   of the sensitive   life, where in the Word of power an eternal sensitive life first takes its origin. 
 - HoP 3",204.0
11735,"For if life had no sensitiveness, it would have no will nor efficacy; but pain -anguish, suffering-first makes it   effectual and endows it with will. 
 - HoP 3",160.0
11736,"And the light of such kindling through fire makes it joyous, for it is an anointment,  joy and loveliness of painfulness. 
 - HoP 3",131.0
11737,"Boehme turns this round in many ways in order to grasp the something Ichts, the Separator, as it rises 143 from the Father. 
 - HoP 3",133.0
11738,"The qualities rise in the great Salitter, stir, raise, and move rÃ¼gen themselves. 
 - HoP 3",92.0
11739,"Boehme has there the quality of astringency in the Father, and he then represents the process of the something Ichts as a sharpness, a drawing together, as a flash of lightning that breaks forth. 
 - HoP 3",205.0
11740,"This light is Lucifer. 
 - HoP 3",32.0
11741,"The Being-for-self, the self-perception, is by Boehme called the drawing together into a point. 
 - HoP 3",105.0
11742,"That is astringency, sharpness, penetration, fierceness; to this pertains the wrath of God, and here Boehme in this manner grasps the other  of God in God Himself. 
 - HoP 3",173.0
11743,"This source can be kindled through great motion or elevation. 
 - HoP 3",71.0
11744,"Through the contraction the creaturely Being is formed so that a heavenly Corpus may be  intelligibly formed. 
 - HoP 3",119.0
11745,"But if it -the sharpness-be kindled through elevation, which those creatures only can do which are created out of the divine Salitter, then it is a burning source-vein of the wrath of God. 
 - HoP 3",198.0
11747,"The flash is still connected with pain; light is what brings intelligence. 
 - HoP 3",84.0
11748,"The divine birth is the going forth of the flash, of the life of all qualities. 
 - HoP 3",89.0
11749,"This is all from the Aurora. 
 - HoP 3",38.0
11750,"In the QuÃ¦stionibus theosophicis Boehme makes particular use of the form of Yes and No for the separator, for this opposition. 
 - HoP 3",137.0
11751,"He says: The reader must know that in Yes and No all things consist, whether divine, devilish, earthly, or what they may be called. 
 - HoP 3",141.0
11752,"The One as the Yes is pure power and life, and it is the truth of God or God Himself. 
 - HoP 3",95.0
11753,"He would be unknowable in Himself, and in Him there would be no joy nor elevation, nor feeling -life-without the No. 
 - HoP 3",126.0
11754,"The No is a counterstroke of the Yes, or of the truth  , that the truth may be manifest and be a something wherein there is a contrarium in which there is the eternal love, moving, feeling, and willing, and demanding to be loved. 
 - HoP 3",239.0
11756,"Without those two, which are continually in strife, all things would be a nothing, and would stand still without movement. 
 - HoP 3",132.0
11757,"If the eternal will did not itself flow from itself and introduce itself into receptibility, there would be no form nor distinction, for all powers would  then be one power. 
 - HoP 3",183.0
11758,"Neither could there be understanding in that case, for the understanding arises   in the differentiation of the manifold, where one property sees, proves and wills the others. 
 - HoP 3",185.0
11759,"The will which has flowed out wills dissimilarity, so that it may be distinguished from similarity and be its own something-and that something may exist, that the eternal seeing may see and feel. 
 - HoP 3",205.0
11760,"And from the individual will arises the No, for it brings itself into ownness, ie receptivity of self. 
 - HoP 3",112.0
11762,"And the No is therefore called a No, because it is a desire turned inwards on itself, as if it were a shutting up into negativity. 
 - HoP 3",140.0
11763,"The emanated seeking will is absorbent and comprehends itself within itself, from it come forms and qualities:  Sharpness,  Motion,  Feeling. 
 - HoP 3",151.0
11764,"The fourth property is Fire as the flash of light; this rises in the bringing together of the great and terrible sharpness and the unity. 
 - HoP 3",147.0
11765,"Thus in the contact a Flagrat Schrack results, and in this Flagrat Schrack unity is apprehended as being a Flash or Gleam, an exulting joy. 
 - HoP 3",149.0
11766,"That is the bursting forth of the unity. 
 - HoP 3",50.0
11768,"And according to that, God is an angry  and jealous God,  and in this we have evil. 
 - HoP 3",93.0

 - HoP 3",142.0
11770,"The fifth quality, Love, makes in the fire, as in pain, another Principium as a great fire of love. 
 - HoP 3",109.0
11771,"These are the main points under the second head. 
 - HoP 3",58.0
11773,"From this eternal operation of the sensation the visible world sprang; the world is the Word which has flowed forth and has disposed itself into qualities, since in qualities the particular will has arisen.

11781,"Finally what comes third in these three-fold forms is the unity of the light, of the separator and power: this is the spirit, which is already partially implied in what has preceded. 
 - HoP 3",192.0
11782,"All the stars signify the power of the Father, and from them issues the sun. 
 - HoP 3",86.0

11788,"We see that the sensuous element thus pertains to this. 
 - HoP 3",65.0
11789,"Boehme really has the idea that Gods essence   is thus not something far away which possesses a particular position or place, for  essence, the abyss of nature and creation, is God Himself. 
 - HoP 3",199.0
11790,"Thou must not think that in heaven there was some manner of Corpus -the seven spirits generate this Corpus or heart-which above all other things is called God. 
 - HoP 3",169.0
11791,"No; but the whole divine power which itself is heaven and the heaven of all heavens, is so generated, and that is called God the Father; of whom all the holy angels are generated, in like manner also the spirit of all men.

11804,"This light, this seeing and understanding, is the second determination; it is the relationship to itself.

11807,"And the Holy Ghost from God rules in this spirit in thee, if thou art a child of light and not of darkness. 
 - HoP 3",117.0
11808,"Now observe: in either wood, stone, or herbs there are three things contained, neither can anything be generated or grow, if but one of the three should be left out. 
 - HoP 3",175.0
11809,"First, there is the power, from which a body comes to be, whether wood, stone, or herbs; after that there is in that  thing a sap which is the heart of the thing.

12029,"To say that anything is contained in the nature or in the Notion of a thing is tantamount to saying that it is true: existence is directly contained in the Notion of God. 
 - HoP 3",180.0
12030,"Hence it is quite true to say of Him that existence pertains of necessity to Him. 
 - HoP 3",91.0
12031,"There is implied in the Notion of every particular thing either a possible or a necessary existence-a necessary existence in the Notion of God, ie of the absolutely perfect Being, for else He would be conceived as imperfect. 
 - HoP 3",234.0
12032,"Descartes likewise argues after this manner: Problem: to prove a posteriori from the mere Notion within us the existence of God. 
 - HoP 3",138.0
12033,"The objective reality of a Notion demands a cause in which the same reality is not merely contained objectively  , but formally   or eminenter. 
 - HoP 3",153.0
12034,"We now have a Notion of God, but His objective reality is neither formally nor eminenter contained within us, and it can thus be only in God Himself. 
 - HoP 3",159.0
12035,"Consequently we see that with Descartes this Idea is an hypothesis. 
 - HoP 3",77.0
12036,"Now we should say we find this highest Idea in us. 
 - HoP 3",60.0
12037,"If we then ask whether this Idea exists, why, this is the Idea, that existence is asserted with it. 
 - HoP 3",109.0
12038,"To say that it is only a conception is to contradict the meaning of this conception. 
 - HoP 3",94.0
12039,"But here it is unsatisfactory to find that the conception is introduced thus: We have this conception, and to find that it consequently appears like an hypothesis. 
 - HoP 3",173.0
12040,"In such a case it is not proved of this content in itself that it determines itself into this unity of thought and Being. 
 - HoP 3",131.0
12041,"In the form of God no other conception is thus here given than that contained in Cogito, ergo sum, wherein Being and thought are inseparably bound up-though now in the form of a conception which I possess within me. 
 - HoP 3",225.0
12042,"The whole content of this conception, the Almighty, All-wise, &c, are predicates which do not make their appearance until later; the content is simply the content of the Idea bound up with existence. 
 - HoP 3",209.0
12044,"Descartes then proceeds: Mind is the more convinced of this when it notices that it discovers within itself the conception of no other thing wherein existence is necessarily implied. 
 - HoP 3",192.0
12045,"From this it will perceive that that idea of highest reality is not imagined by it, it is not chimerical, but a true and unalterable fact which cannot do otherwise than exist, seeing that existence is necessarily involved in it. 
 - HoP 3",238.0
12046,"Our prejudices hinder us from apprehending this with ease, for we are accustomed to distinguish in all other things the essence   from the existence. 
 - HoP 3",159.0
12047,"Respecting the assertion that thought is not inseparable from existence, the common way of talking is as follows: If what men think really existed, things would be different. 
 - HoP 3",184.0
12049,"But how can one argue from finite things to the infinite? This Notion,  Descartes continues, is furthermore not made by us. 
 - HoP 3",133.0
12050,"It is now declared to be an eternal truth which is revealed in us. 
 - HoP 3",76.0
12051,"We do not find in ourselves the perfections which are contained in this conception. 
 - HoP 3",93.0
12053,"From Him we must thus in true science deduce all created things. 
 - HoP 3",74.0
12054,"With the proof of the existence of God the validity of and evidence for all truth in its origin is immediately established. 
 - HoP 3",133.0
12055,"God as First Cause is Being-for-self, the reality which is not merely entity or existence in thought. 
 - HoP 3",111.0
12056,"An existence such as this first cause  rests in the Notion of the not-I, not of each determinate thing-since these as determinate are negations-but only in the Notion of pure existence or the perfect cause. 
 - HoP 3",216.0
12057,"It is the cause of the truth of ideas, for the aspect that it represents is that of their Being. 
 - HoP 3",106.0
12058,"Fourthly, Descartes goes on to assert: We must believe what is revealed to us by God, though we cannot understand it. 
 - HoP 3",127.0
12059,"It is not to be wondered at, since we are finite, that there is in Gods nature as inconceivably infinite, what passes our comprehension. 
 - HoP 3",146.0
12060,"This represents the entrance of a very ordinary conception. 
 - HoP 3",69.0
12061,"Boehme on the other hand says : The mystery of the Trinity is ever born within us. 
 - HoP 3",92.0
12062,"Descartes, however, concludes: Hence we must not trouble ourselves with investigations respecting the infinite; for seeing that we are finite, it is absurd for us to say anything about it. 
 - HoP 3",198.0
12063,"This matter we shall not, however, enter upon at present. 
 - HoP 3",67.0
12064,"Now the first attribute of God is that He is true and the Giver of all light; it is hence quite contrary to His nature to deceive us. 
 - HoP 3",143.0
12065,"Hence the light of nature or the power of acquiring knowledge given us by God can affect no object which is not really true in as far as it is affected by it   ie as it is perceived clearly and distinctly. 
 - HoP 3",215.0
12066,"We ascribe truth to God. 
 - HoP 3",34.0
12067,"From this Descartes goes on to infer the universal bond which exists between absolute knowledge and the objectivity of what we thus know. 
 - HoP 3",147.0
12068,"Knowledge has objects, has a content which is known; we call this connection truth. 
 - HoP 3",93.0
12069,"The truth of God is just this unity of what is thought by the subject or clearly perceived, and external reality or existence. 
 - HoP 3",136.0
12070,"Thereby an end is put to doubt, as if it could be the case that what appears quite evident to us should not be really true. 
 - HoP 3",133.0
12071,"We can thus no longer have any suspicion of mathematical truths. 
 - HoP 3",74.0
12072,"Likewise if we give heed to what we distinguish by our senses in waking or in sleeping, clearly and distinctly, it is easy to recognize in each thing what in it is true. 
 - HoP 3",179.0
12073,"By saying that what is rightly and clearly thought likewise is, Descartes maintains that man comes to know by means of thought what in fact is in things; the sources of errors lie on the other hand in the finitude of our nature. 
 - HoP 3",238.0
12074,"It is certain, because of Gods truth, that the faculty of perceiving and that of assenting through the will, if it extends no further than to that which is clearly perceived, cannot lead to error. 
 - HoP 3",206.0
12075,"Even if this cannot be in any way proved, it is by nature so established in all things, that as often as we clearly perceive anything, we assent to it from ourselves and can in no wise doubt that it is true. 
 - HoP 3",217.0
12076,"All this is set forth very plausibly, but it is still indeterminate, formal, and shallow; we only have the assertion made to us that this is so. 
 - HoP 3",154.0
12077,"Descartes method is the method of the clear understanding merely. 
 - HoP 3",75.0
12078,"Certainty with him takes the first place; from it no content is deduced of necessity, no content generally, and still less its objectivity as distinguished from the inward subjectivity of the I. 
 - HoP 3",204.0
12079,"At one time we have the opposition of subjective knowledge and actuality, and at another their inseparable union. 
 - HoP 3",123.0
12080,"In the first case the necessity of mediating them enters in, and the truth of God is asserted to be this mediating power. 
 - HoP 3",131.0
12081,"It consists in this, that His Notion contains reality immediately in itself. 
 - HoP 3",86.0
12082,"The proof of this unity then rests solely upon the fact of its being said that we find within us the idea of complete perfection; thus this conception here appears simply as one found ready to hand. 
 - HoP 3",208.0
12083,"With this is compared the mere conception of God which contains no existence within it, and it is found that without existence it would be imperfect. 
 - HoP 3",159.0
12084,"This unity of God Himself, of His Idea, with His existence, is undoubtedly the Truth; in this we find the ground for holding as true what is for us just as certain as the truth of ourselves. 
 - HoP 3",200.0
12085,"As Descartes proceeds further we thus find that in reality everything has truth for him only in so far as it is really an object of thought, a universal. 
 - HoP 3",163.0
12086,"This truth of God has been, as we shall see, expressed even more clearly and in a more concise way by a disciple of Descartes, if one may venture to call him so-I mean Malebranche ,177 in his Recherche de la vÃ©ritÃ©. 
 - HoP 3",227.0
12087,"The first of the fundamental determinations of the Cartesian metaphysics is from the certainty of oneself to arrive at the truth, to recognize Being in the Notion of thought. 
 - HoP 3",184.0
12089,"In the second place the negative of Being likewise comes before self-consciousness, and this negative, united with the positive I, is so to speak implicitly united in a third, in God. 
 - HoP 3",193.0
12092,"But the very Notion of present existence is this negative of self-consciousness, not out of thought,-but the thought of the out of thought. 
 - HoP 3",149.0
12093,"Descartes accepts Being in the entirely positive sense, and has not the conception of its being the negative of self-consciousness: but simple Being, set forth as the negative of self-consciousness, is extension. 
 - HoP 3",222.0
12096,"As a matter of fact the effect is less perfect than the cause, since it is that which is posited, if we are to remain at the conception of cause pertaining to the understanding. 
 - HoP 3",187.0
12097,"Hence according to Descartes extension is the less perfect. 
 - HoP 3",69.0
12099,"Preservation is, however, unceasing reproduction. 
 - HoP 3",59.0
12101,"He calls those last something inborn within us, something not made by us or merely felt,179 but the eternal Notion of mind itself and the eternal determinations of its freedom, of itself as itself. 
 - HoP 3",207.0
12102,"From this point the conception that ideas are inborn  hence proceeds; this is the question over which Locke and Leibnitz dispute. 
 - HoP 3",139.0
12103,"The expression eternal truths  is current even in these modern times, and it signifies the universal determinations and relations which exist entirely on their own account. 
 - HoP 3",182.0
12104,"The word inborn is however a clumsy and stupid expression, because the conception of physical birth thereby indicated, does not apply to mind. 
 - HoP 3",152.0
12106,"We would rather say that such is implied in the nature and essence of our mind and spirit. 
 - HoP 3",100.0
12107,"Mind is active and conducts itself in its activity in a determinate manner; but this activity has no other ground than its freedom. 
 - HoP 3",141.0
12108,"Yet if this is the case more is required than merely to say so; it must be deduced as a necessary product of our mind. 
 - HoP 3",128.0
12109,"We have such ideas, for instance, in the logical laws: From nothing comes nothing,  A thing cannot both be and not be, 180 as also in moral principles. 
 - HoP 3",161.0
12110,"These are facts of consciousness which Descartes however soon passes from again; they are only present in thought as subjective, and he has thus not yet inquired respecting their content. 
 - HoP 3",197.0
12112,"But although Descartes laid it down formerly as essential that no hypotheses must be made, yet now he takes the conceptions, and passes on to them as something found within our consciousness. 
 - HoP 3",201.0
12115,"That is then called the system of assistance  which is, however, transcendental. 
 - HoP 3",90.0
12116,"God is the absolute uniter of Notion and actuality; other things, finite things which have a limit and stand in dependence, require something else. 
 - HoP 3",157.0
12118,"But I do not recognize more than two sorts of things; the one is that of thinking things, and the other that of things which relate to what is extended. 
 - HoP 3",162.0
12119,"Thought, the Notion, the spiritual, the self-conscious, is what is at home with itself, and its opposite is contained in what is extended, spatial, separated, not at home with itself nor free. 
 - HoP 3",202.0
12120,"This is the real distinction  of substances: The one substance can be clearly and definitely comprehended without the other. 
 - HoP 3",134.0
12121,"But the corporeal and the thinking and creating substance can be comprehended under this common notion, for the reason that they are things which require Gods support alone in order to exist. 
 - HoP 3",201.0
12122,"They are universal; other finite things require other things as conditions essential to their existence. 
 - HoP 3",114.0
12123,"But extended substance, the kingdom of nature, and spiritual substance, do not require one another. 
 - HoP 3",109.0
12124,"They may be called substances, because each of them constitutes an entire range or sphere, an independent totality. 
 - HoP 3",125.0
12126,"Descartes proceeds from the Notion of God to what is created, to thought and extension, and from this to the particular. 
 - HoP 3",130.0
12128,"Thus thought constitutes the absolute attribute of mind,  thought is its quality; extension is  the essential determination of corporeality, and this alone is the true nature of body. 
 - HoP 3",193.0
12129,"What remains are merely secondary qualities, modes, like figure and movement in what is extended, imagination, feeling and will in thinking; they may be taken away or thought away. 
 - HoP 3",190.0
12130,"God is the uncreated, thinking substance. 
 - HoP 3",51.0
12131,"Descartes here passes to what is individual, and because he follows up extension he arrives at matter, rest, movement. 
 - HoP 3",128.0
12133,"We say that body offers resistance, has smell, taste, colour, transparency, hardness, &c, since without these we can have no body. 
 - HoP 3",140.0
12134,"All these further determinations respecting what is extended, such as size, rest, movement, and inertia, are, however, merely sensuous, and this Descartes showed, as it had long before this been shown by the Sceptics. 
 - HoP 3",227.0
12135,"Undoubtedly that is the abstract Notion or pure essence, but to body or to pure existence, there likewise of necessity pertains negativity or diversity. 
 - HoP 3",162.0
12136,"By means of the following illustration Descartes showed that with the exception of extension, all corporeal determinations may be annihilated, and that none can be absolutely predicated. 
 - HoP 3",196.0
12137,"We draw conclusions respecting the solidity and hardness of matter from the resistance which a body offers to our disturbance, and by means of which it seeks to hold its place. 
 - HoP 3",186.0
12138,"Now if we admit that matter as we touch it always gives way to us like space, we should have no reason for ascribing to it solidity. 
 - HoP 3",142.0
12139,"Smell, colour, taste, are in the same way sensuous qualities merely; but what we clearly perceive is alone true. 
 - HoP 3",122.0
12140,"If a body is ground into small parts, it gives way, and yet it does not lose its nature; resistance is thus not essential. 
 - HoP 3",132.0
12141,"This not-being-for-itself is however a quantitatively slighter resistance only; the resistance always remains. 
 - HoP 3",120.0
12142,"But Descartes desires only to think; now he does not think resistance, colour, &c, but apprehends them by the senses only. 
 - HoP 3",132.0
12143,"Hence he says that all this must be led back to extension as being special modifications of the same. 
 - HoP 3",111.0
12147,"These are unmeaning propositions, for an abstraction is involved for instance in asserting simple rest and movement in their opposition. 
 - HoP 3",146.0
12148,"Extension and motion are the fundamental conceptions in mechanical physics; they represent the truth of the corporeal world. 
 - HoP 3",134.0
12149,"It is thus that ideality comes before the mind of Descartes, and he is far elevated above the reality of the sensuous qualities, although he does not reach so far as to the separation of this ideality. 
 - HoP 3",211.0
12150,"He thus remains at the point of view of mechanism pure and simple. 
 - HoP 3",76.0
12151,"Give me matter  and motion and I will build worlds for you, is what Descartes virtually says. 
 - HoP 3",103.0
12152,"Space and time were hence to him the only determinations of the material universe. 
 - HoP 3",92.0
12153,"In this, then, lies the mechanical fashion of viewing nature, or the natural philosophy of Descartes is seen to be purely mechanical. 
 - HoP 3",143.0
12155,"In living beings processes such as that of digestion are mechanical effects which have as principles, rest and movement. 
 - HoP 3",130.0
12156,"We here see the ground and origin of the mechanical philosophy; but further on we find that this is unsatisfactory, for matter and motion do not suffice to explain life. 
 - HoP 3",179.0
12157,"Yet the great matter in all this is that thought goes forward in its determinations, and that it constitutes from these thought-determinations the truth of nature. 
 - HoP 3",173.0
12158,"In his consideration of the system of the world and the movement of the heavenly bodies, Descartes has worked out the mechanical view more fully. 
 - HoP 3",155.0
12161,"Descartes thus mingles many observations with a metaphysic of this nature, and to us the result is hence obscure. 
 - HoP 3",123.0
12162,"In this philosophy the thinking treatment of empiricism is thus predominant, and a similar method has been adopted by philosophers from this time on. 
 - HoP 3",159.0
12163,"To Descartes and others, Philosophy had still the more indefinite significance of arriving at knowledge through thought, reflection, and reasoning. 
 - HoP 3",157.0
12166,"The strictly scientific element here really consisted mainly in the method of proof as it has long been made use of in geometry, and in the ordinary method of the formal logical syllogism. 
 - HoP 3",198.0
12168,"And this is the case with Descartes. 
 - HoP 3",46.0
12169,"The first part of the Principia philosophiÃ¦ treats De principiis cognitionis humanÃ¦, the second De principiis rerum materialium. 
 - HoP 3",140.0

 - HoP 3",189.0
12172,"In this reference Descartes treats of thought and human freedom. 
 - HoP 3",74.0
12173,"He proves freedom from the fact of the soul thinking that the will is unrestrained, and of that constituting the perfection of mankind. 
 - HoP 3",145.0
12174,"And this is quite true. 
 - HoP 3",33.0
12175,"In respect to the freedom of the will he comes across the difficulty of how to reconcile it with the divine prescience. 
 - HoP 3",129.0
12176,"As free, man might do what is not ordained of God beforehand-this would conflict with the omnipotence and omniscience of God; and if everything is ordained of God, human freedom would thereby be done away with. 
 - HoP 3",220.0

 - HoP 3",72.0
12182,"Some particular assertions made by Descartes, which have been specially instrumental in giving him fame, have still to be mentioned-particular forms which have been formerly considered in metaphysics, and likewise by Wolff. 
 - HoP 3",233.0
12184,"In the sharp opposition between thought and extension, the former is not considered as sensation, so that the latter can isolate itself. 
 - HoP 3",146.0
12185,"The organic must as body reduce itself to extension; any further development of this last thus only proves its dependence on the first determinations. 
 - HoP 3",160.0
12186,"In the second place, the relation between soul and body now becomes an important question, that is, the return of the object within itself in such a way that thought posits itself in another, in matter. 
 - HoP 3",212.0
12187,"As to this, many systems are offered to us in metaphysics. 
 - HoP 3",68.0
12188,"One of these is the influxus physicus, that the relation of spirit is of a corporeal nature, that the object is related to mind as bodies are to one another-a conception like this is very crude. 
 - HoP 3",204.0
12190,"Soul could only influence body in so far as it required the same, and conversely-that is, in so far as they have actual relation to one another. 
 - HoP 3",154.0
12191,"But since each is a totality, neither can bear a real relation to the other. 
 - HoP 3",86.0
12192,"Descartes consistently denied the physical influence of one on the other; that would have signified a mechanical relation between the two. 
 - HoP 3",148.0
12193,"Descartes thus established the intellectual sphere in contradistinction to matter, and on it based the independent subsistence of mind; for in his cogito I is at first only certain of itself, since I can abstract from all. 
 - HoP 3",232.0
12194,"Now we find the necessity of a mediator to bring about a union of the abstract and the external and individual. 
 - HoP 3",121.0
12195,"Descartes settles this by placing between the two what constitutes the metaphysical ground of their mutual changes, God. 
 - HoP 3",130.0
12196,"He is the intermediate bond of union, in as far as He affords assistance to the soul in what it cannot through its own freedom accomplish, so that the changes in body and soul may correspond with one another. 
 - HoP 3",218.0
12197,"For above  we saw that Descartes says of God that He is the Truth of the conception: as long as I think rightly and consistently, something real corresponds to my thought, and the connecting link is God.

12231,"Some time after this he wrote his Tractatus theologico-politicus, and by it gained considerable reputation. 
 - HoP 3",117.0
12233,"It contains his views on inspiration, a critical treatment of the books of Moses and the like, chiefly from the point of view that the laws therein contained are limited in their application to the Jews. 
 - HoP 3",213.0
12235,"All this, however, is already to be found in the above-mentioned work of Spinoza. 
 - HoP 3",91.0
12236,"But Spinoza drew the greatest odium upon himself by his philosophy proper, which we must now consider as it is given to us in his Ethics. 
 - HoP 3",147.0
12237,"While Descartes published no writings on this subject, the Ethics of Spinoza is undoubtedly his greatest work; it was published after his death by Ludwig Mayer, a physician, who had been Spinozas most intimate friend. 
 - HoP 3",227.0
12238,"It consists of five parts; the first deals with God. 
 - HoP 3",62.0
12239,"General metaphysical ideas are contained in it, which include the knowledge of God and nature. 
 - HoP 3",104.0
12240,"The second part deals with the nature and origin of mind. 
 - HoP 3",67.0
12244,"Spinozas system is that of Descartes made objective in the form of absolute truth. 
 - HoP 3",92.0
12245,"The simple thought of Spinozas idealism is this: The true is simply and solely the one substance, whose attributes are thought and extension or nature: and only this absolute unity is reality, it alone is God. 
 - HoP 3",219.0
12246,"It is, as with Descartes, the unity of thought and Being, or that which contains the Notion of its existence in itself. 
 - HoP 3",129.0
12247,"The Cartesian substance, as Idea, has certainly Being included in its Notion; but it is only Being as abstract, not as real Being or as extension. 
 - HoP 3",156.0
12248,"With Descartes corporeality and the thinking I are altogether independent Beings; this independence of the two extremes is done away with in Spinozism by their becoming moments of the one absolute Being. 
 - HoP 3",213.0
12249,"This expression signifies that Being must be grasped as the unity of opposites; the chief consideration is not to let slip the opposition and set it aside, but to reconcile and resolve it. 
 - HoP 3",198.0
12251,"The pure thought of Spinoza is therefore not the simple universal of Plato, for it has likewise come to know the absolute opposition of Notion and Being. 
 - HoP 3",163.0
12252,"Taken as a whole, this constitutes the Idea of Spinoza, and it is just what Ïá½¸ á½Î½ was to the Eleatics. 
 - HoP 3",118.0
12255,"It is therefore worthy of note that thought must begin by placing itself at the standpoint of Spinozism; to be a follower of Spinoza is the essential commencement of all Philosophy. 
 - HoP 3",191.0
12257,"The difference between our standpoint and that of the Eleatic philosophy is only this, that through the agency of Christianity concrete individuality is in the modern world present throughout in spirit. 
 - HoP 3",212.0
12258,"But in spite of the infinite demands on the part of the concrete, substance with Spinoza is not yet determined as in itself concrete. 
 - HoP 3",143.0
12259,"As the concrete is thus not present in the content of substance, it is therefore to be found within reflecting thought alone, and it is only from the endless oppositions of this last that the required unity emerges. 
 - HoP 3",225.0
12260,"Of substance as such there is nothing more to be said; all that we can do is to speak of the different ways in which Philosophy has dealt with it, and the opposites which in it are abrogated. 
 - HoP 3",201.0
12261,"The difference depends on the nature of the opposites which are held to be abrogated in substance. 
 - HoP 3",108.0
12263,"Spinoza begins  with a series of definitions, from which we take the following. 
 - HoP 3",89.0
12264,"Spinozas first definition is of the Cause of itself. 
 - HoP 3",62.0
12265,"He says: By that which is causa sui, its own cause, I understand that whose essence   involves existence, or which cannot be conceived except as existent. 
 - HoP 3",164.0
12266,"The unity of existence and universal thought is asserted from the very first, and this unity will ever be the question at issue. 
 - HoP 3",138.0
12268,"The establishing of itself as an other is loss or degeneration, and at the same time the negation of this loss; this is a purely speculative Notion, indeed a fundamental Notion in all speculation. 
 - HoP 3",206.0
12269,"The cause in which the cause is identical with the effect, is the infinite cause ; if Spinoza had further developed what lies in the causa sui, substance with him would not have been rigid and unworkable. 
 - HoP 3",214.0
12270,"The second definition is that of the finite. 
 - HoP 3",54.0
12271,"That thing is said to be finite in its kind which can be limited by another of the same nature,  For it comes then to an end, it is not there; what is there is something else. 
 - HoP 3",185.0
12273,"That is the affirmative side of the limit. 
 - HoP 3",52.0
12274,"Thus a thought is  only limited by another thought, a body by another body, but thoughts are not limited by bodies nor  conversely bodies by thoughts. 
 - HoP 3",160.0
12275,"We saw this  with Descartes: thought is an independent totality and so is extension, they have nothing to do with one another; they do not limit each other, each is included in itself. 
 - HoP 3",194.0
12276,"The third definition is that of substance. 
 - HoP 3",52.0
12278,"What cannot have a conception formed of it without the aid of something else, is not independent, but is dependent upon that something else. 
 - HoP 3",150.0
12279,"In the fourth place Spinoza defines attributes, which, as the moment coming second to substance, belong to it. 
 - HoP 3",120.0
12280,"By attribute I understand that which the mind perceives as constituting the essence of substance;  and to Spinoza this alone is true. 
 - HoP 3",143.0
12281,"This is an important determination; the attribute is undoubtedly a determinateness, but at the same time it remains a totality. 
 - HoP 3",137.0
12282,"Spinoza, like Descartes, accepts only two attributes, thought and extension. 
 - HoP 3",86.0
12283,"The understanding grasps them as the reality of substance, but the reality is not higher than the substance, for it is only reality in the view of the understanding, which falls outside substance. 
 - HoP 3",206.0
12285,"This is the true completion; but where substance passes over into attribute is not stated. 
 - HoP 3",100.0
12286,"The fifth definition has to do with what comes third in relation to substance, the mode. 
 - HoP 3",98.0
12287,"By mode I understand the affections of substance, or that which is in something else, through the aid of which also it is conceived. 
 - HoP 3",142.0
12291,"The mode is the individual, the finite as such, which enters into external connection with what is other. 
 - HoP 3",115.0
12292,"In this Spinoza only descends to a lower stage, the mode is only the foregoing warped and stunted. 
 - HoP 3",108.0
12293,"Spinozas defect is therefore this, that he takes the third moment as mode alone, as a false individuality. 
 - HoP 3",116.0
12294,"True individuality and subjectivity is not a mere retreat from the universal, not merely something clearly determinate; for, as clearly determinate, it is at the same time Being-for-itself, determined by itself alone. 
 - HoP 3",227.0
12295,"The individual, the subjective, is even in being so the return to the universal; and in that it is at home with itself, it is itself the universal. 
 - HoP 3",157.0
12296,"The return consists simply and solely in the fact of the particular being in itself the universal; to this return Spinoza did not attain. 
 - HoP 3",147.0
12297,"Rigid substantiality is the last point he reached, not infinite form; this he knew not, and thus determinateness continually vanishes from his thought. 
 - HoP 3",161.0
12298,"In the sixth place, the definition of the infinite is also of importance, for in the infinite Spinoza defines more strictly than anywhere else the Notion of the Notion. 
 - HoP 3",178.0
12299,"The infinite has a double significance, according as it is taken as the infinitely many or as the absolutely infinite. 
 - HoP 3",128.0
12300,"The infinite in its kind is not such in respect of all possible attributes; but the absolutely infinite is that to whose essence all belongs that expresses an essence and contains no negation. 
 - HoP 3",202.0
12301,"In the same sense Spinoza distinguishes in the nine-and-twentieth Letter  the infinite of imagination from the infinite of thought , the actual  infinite. 
 - HoP 3",164.0
12303,"An infinite numerical series in mathematics is exactly the same thing. 
 - HoP 3",80.0
12304,"If a certain fraction is represented as a decimal fraction, it is incomplete; â is, on the contrary, the true infinite, and therefore not an incomplete expression, although the content here is of course limited. 
 - HoP 3",223.0
12305,"It is infinity in the incorrect sense that one usually has in view when infinity is spoken of; and even if it is looked on as sublime, it yet is nothing present, and only goes ever out into the negative, without being actual. 
 - HoP 3",235.0
12307,"Philosophic infinity, that which is infinite actu, Spinoza therefore calls the absolute affirmation of itself. 
 - HoP 3",120.0
12308,"This is quite correct, only it might have been better expressed as: It is the negation of negation. 
 - HoP 3",109.0
12309,"Spinoza here also employs geometrical figures as illustrations of the Notion of infinity. 
 - HoP 3",99.0
12310,"In his Opera postuma, preceding his Ethics, and also in the letter quoted above, he has two circles, one of which lies within the other, which have not, however, a common centre. 
 - HoP 3",188.0
12311,"Illustration  The inequalities of the space between A B and C D exceed every number; and yet the space which lies between is not so very great. 
 - HoP 3",153.0
12312,"That is to say, if I wish to determine them all, I must enter upon an infinite series. 
 - HoP 3",96.0
12314,"Or a finite line consists of an infinite number of points; and yet the line is present here and determined; the beyond  of the infinite number of points, which are not complete, is in it complete and called back into unity. 
 - HoP 3",233.0
12315,"The infinite should be represented as actually present, and this comes to pass in the Notion of the cause of itself, which is therefore the true infinity. 
 - HoP 3",164.0
12316,"As soon as the cause has something else opposed to it-the effect-finitude is present; but here this something else is at the same time abrogated and it becomes once more the cause itself. 
 - HoP 3",197.0
12317,"The affirmative is thus negation of negation, since, according to the well-known grammatical rule, duplex negatio affirmat. 
 - HoP 3",133.0
12318,"In the same way Spinozas earlier definitions have also the infinite already implied in them, for instance in the case of the just mentioned cause of itself, inasmuch as he defines it as that whose essence involves existence. 
 - HoP 3",234.0
12319,"Notion and existence are each the Beyond of the other; but cause of itself, as thus including them, is really the carrying back of this beyond  into unity. 
 - HoP 3",165.0
12320,"Or  Substance is that which is in itself and is conceived from itself;  that is the same unity of Notion and existence. 
 - HoP 3",129.0
12321,"The infinite is in the same way in itself and has also its Notion in itself; its Notion is its Being, and its Being its Notion; true infinity is therefore to be found in Spinoza. 
 - HoP 3",188.0
12323,"Finally Spinoza says in the seventh place: God is a Being absolutely infinite, ie a substance consisting of infinite attributes, each of which expresses an eternal and infinite essence. 
 - HoP 3",195.0
12325,"The whole of Spinozas philosophy is contained in these definitions, which, however, taken as a whole are formal; it is really a weak point in Spinoza that he begins thus with definitions. 
 - HoP 3",197.0
12326,"In mathematics this method is permitted, because at the outset we there make assumptions, such as that of the point and line; but in Philosophy the content should be known as the absolutely true. 
 - HoP 3",205.0
12328,"Such a question is not asked in the case of geometrical propositions, but in philosophic investigation it is the very thing to be first considered, and this Spinoza has not done. 
 - HoP 3",188.0
12329,"Instead of only explaining these simple thoughts and representing them as concrete in the definitions which he makes, what he ought to have done was to examine whether this content is true. 
 - HoP 3",199.0
12330,"To all appearance it is only the explanation of the words that is given; but the content of the words is held to be established. 
 - HoP 3",138.0
12331,"All further content is merely derived from that, and proved thereby; for on the first content all the rest depends, and if it is established as a basis, the other necessarily follows. 
 - HoP 3",193.0
12332,"The attribute is that which the understanding thinks of God. 
 - HoP 3",70.0
12334,"These definitions are followed by axioms and propositions in which Spinoza proves a great variety of points. 
 - HoP 3",118.0
12335,"He descends from the universal of substance through the particular, thought and extension, to the individual. 
 - HoP 3",119.0
12336,"He has thus all three moments of the Notion, or they are essential to him. 
 - HoP 3",84.0
12337,"But the mode, under which head falls individuality, he does not recognize as essential, or as constituting a moment of true existence in that existence; for it disappears in existence, or it is not raised into the Notion. 
 - HoP 3",231.0
12338,"The main point then is that Spinoza proves from these Notions that there is only One Substance, God. 
 - HoP 3",110.0
12339,"It is a simple chain of reasoning, a very formal proof. 
 - HoP 3",65.0
12340,"Fifth Proposition: There cannot be two or more substances of the same nature or of the same attribute. 
 - HoP 3",112.0
12341,"This is implied already in the definitions; the proof is therefore a useless and wearisome toil, which only serves to render Spinoza more difficult to understand. 
 - HoP 3",172.0
12342,"If there were several   they must be distinguished from one another either by the diversity of their attributes or by the diversity of their affections. 
 - HoP 3",162.0
12343,"If they are distinguished by their attributes, it would be directly conceded that there is only one substance having the same attribute. 
 - HoP 3",146.0
12344,"For the attributes are simply what the understanding grasps as the essence of the one substance, which is determined in itself, and not through anything else. 
 - HoP 3",168.0
12346,"Eighth Proposition: All substance is necessarily infinite. 
 - HoP 3",68.0
12347,"Proof: For otherwise it must be limited by another substance of the same nature, in which case there would be two substances of the same attribute, which is contrary to the fifth proposition. 
 - HoP 3",201.0
12348,"Every attribute must be conceived for itself,  as determination reflected on itself. 
 - HoP 3",94.0
12349,"For attribute is what the mind conceives of substance as constituting its essence, from which it follows that it must be conceived through itself,  ie substance is what is conceived through itself. 
 - HoP 3",207.0
12351,"Substance is indivisible. 
 - HoP 3",35.0
12352,"For if the parts retained the nature of the substance, there would be several substances of the same nature, which is contrary to the fifth proposition. 
 - HoP 3",162.0
12353,"If not, infinite substance would cease to exist, which is absurd. 
 - HoP 3",75.0
12355,"Consequently the substance would not have its own being, but that of God, and therefore would not be a substance. 
 - HoP 3",123.0
12356,"Or if it were still to be substance, then there would necessarily follow the possibility of there being two substances with the same attribute, which according to the fifth proposition is absurd. 
 - HoP 3",205.0
12357,"From this it then follows that the thing extended and the thing that thinks  are not substances, but are either attributes of God, or affections of His attributes. 
 - HoP 3",173.0
12358,"By these proofs and others like them not much is to be gained. 
 - HoP 3",72.0
12359,"Fifteenth, proposition: What is, is in God, and cannot exist or be conceived without God. 
 - HoP 3",99.0
12360,"Sixteenth proposition: By the necessity of the divine nature infinite things must follow in infinite modes, ie, all that can fall under the infinite understanding. 
 - HoP 3",173.0
12361,"God is therefore the absolute First Cause. 
 - HoP 3",52.0
12362,"There is no cause which inwardly or outwardly moves Him to act, except the perfection of His nature. 
 - HoP 3",110.0
12364,"That is to say, His Being is His absolute power; actus and potentia, Thought and Being, are in Him one. 
 - HoP 3",113.0
12365,"God has not therefore any other thoughts which He could not have actualized. 
 - HoP 3",86.0
12366,"God is the immanent cause of all things, not the transient ,  ie, external cause. 
 - HoP 3",91.0
12367,"His essence and His existence are the same, namely, the truth. 
 - HoP 3",72.0
12368,"A thing which is determined to perform some action, is, since God is cause, necessarily determined thereto by God; and a thing which is thus determined cannot render itself undetermined. 
 - HoP 3",196.0
12369,"In nature nothing is contingent. 
 - HoP 3",42.0
12370,"Will is not a free cause, but only a necessary cause, only a mode; it is therefore determined by another. 
 - HoP 3",115.0
12371,"God acts in accordance with no final causes. 
 - HoP 3",54.0
12372,"Those who assert that He does so, appear to establish something apart from God, which does not depend on God, and which God in His working keeps in view, as though it were an end. 
 - HoP 3",189.0
12373,"If this view is taken, God is not a free cause, but is subject to fate. 
 - HoP 3",81.0
12374,"It is equally inadmissible to subject all things to the arbitrary pleasure of God, ie, to His indifferent will. 
 - HoP 3",121.0
12375,"He is then absolute power in contrast to wisdom, which sets up definite aims, and consequently limitations; particular aims, thoughts of what is about to come to pass, and the like are therefore put out of the question. 
 - HoP 3",229.0
12376,"But beyond this universal, no advance is made; for it must be noticed as specially singular, that Spinoza in the fiftieth Letter  says that every determination is a negation. 
 - HoP 3",184.0
12377,"Moreover, if God is the cause of the world, it is implied that He is finite; for the world is here put beside God as something different from Him. 
 - HoP 3",156.0
12378,"The greatest difficulty in Spinoza is, in the distinctions to which he comes, to grasp the relation of this determinate to God, at the same time preserving the determination. 
 - HoP 3",184.0
12380,"God is an extended Being for the same reason. 
 - HoP 3",55.0
12381,"This means that the same substance, under the attribute of thought, is the intelligible world, and under the attribute of extension, is nature; nature and thought thus both express the same Essence of God. 
 - HoP 3",215.0
12382,"Or, as Spinoza says, The order and system of natural things is the same as the order of the thoughts. 
 - HoP 3",111.0
12383,"Thus, for instance, the circle which exists in nature, and the idea of the existing circle, which is also in God, are one and the same thing  , which is  merely expressed by means of different attributes. 
 - HoP 3",214.0
12384,"If we therefore regard nature either under the attribute of extension or of thought, or under any other attribute whatever, we shall find one and the same connection of causes, ie, the same sequence of things. 
 - HoP 3",219.0
12386,"But Spinoza does not demonstrate how these two are evolved from the one substance, nor does he prove why there can only be two of them. 
 - HoP 3",145.0
12389,"The differences are not in themselves, but the different aspects from which the Absolute is regarded are matters external to it. 
 - HoP 3",138.0
12390,"We take a higher tone in saying that nature and mind are rational; but reason is for us no empty word, for it means the totality which develops itself within itself. 
 - HoP 3",175.0
12391,"Again, it is the standpoint of reflection to regard aspects only, and nothing in itself. 
 - HoP 3",98.0
12393,"Absolute substance, attribute and mode, Spinoza allows to follow one another as definitions, he adopts them ready-made, without the attributes being developed from the substance, or the modes from the attributes. 
 - HoP 3",222.0
12394,"And more especially in regard to the attributes, there is no necessity evident, why these are thought and extension in particular. 
 - HoP 3",140.0
12397,"Of the modes he says : In every attribute there are two modes; in extension, these are rest and motion, in thought they are understanding and will. 
 - HoP 3",157.0
12398,"They are mere modifications which only exist for us apart from God; therefore whatever refers to this difference and is specially brought about by it, is not absolute, but finite. 
 - HoP 3",189.0
12401,"From God proceeds nothing, for all things merely return to the point whence they came, if from themselves the commencement is made. 
 - HoP 3",141.0
12402,"These then are Spinozas general forms, this is his principal idea. 
 - HoP 3",76.0
12403,"Some further determinations have still to be mentioned. 
 - HoP 3",65.0
12404,"He gives definitions of the terms modes, understanding, will, and of the affections, such as joy and sadness. 
 - HoP 3",119.0
12405,"Its development is extremely simple, or rather it is not developed at all; Spinoza begins directly with mind. 
 - HoP 3",119.0
12406,"The essence of man consists of certain modifications of the attributes of God ; these modifications are only something related to our understanding. 
 - HoP 3",158.0
12407,"If we, therefore, say that the human mind perceives this or that, it means nothing else than that God has this or that idea, not in so far as He is infinite, but in so far as He is expressed by the idea of the human mind. 
 - HoP 3",231.0
12409,"Truth is for Spinoza, on the other hand, the adequate. 
 - HoP 3",64.0
12411,"The object of the idea which constitutes the human mind is body, or a certain mode of extension. 
 - HoP 3",106.0
12412,"If, then, the object of the idea which constitutes the human mind, is the body, there can happen nothing in the body which is not perceived by the mind. 
 - HoP 3",162.0
12413,"Otherwise the ideas of the affections of the body would not be in God, in so far as He constitutes our mind, but the idea of another thing: that is to say, the ideas of the affections of our body would not be likewise in our mind. 
 - HoP 3",240.0
12416,"Mind knows itself only in so far as it perceives the ideas of the affections of body,  it has only the idea of the affections of its body; this idea is synthetic combination, as we shall immediately see. 
 - HoP 3",213.0
12417,"The ideas, whether of the attributes of God or of individual things, do not recognize as their efficient cause their objects themselves, or the things perceived, but God Himself, in so far as He is that which thinks. 
 - HoP 3",226.0
12418,"Spinoza, however, also accepts both in their separation from one another. 
 - HoP 3",83.0
12419,"The idea of body, he writes , includes only these two in itself, and does not express any other attributes. 
 - HoP 3",117.0
12420,"The body which it represents is regarded under the attribute of extension; but the idea itself is a mode of thought. 
 - HoP 3",126.0
12421,"Here we see a dividing asunder; mere identity, the undistinguishable nature of all things in the Absolute, is insufficient even for Spinoza. 
 - HoP 3",150.0
12423,"Here we are at the extreme limit of Spinozas system, and it is here that his weak point appears. 
 - HoP 3",106.0
12424,"Individuation, the one, is a mere synthesis; it is quite a different thing from the Ichts or self-hood of Boehme , since Spinoza has only universality, thought, and not self-consciousness. 
 - HoP 3",198.0
12425,"If, before considering this in reference to the whole, we take it from the other side, namely from the understanding, the distinction really falls under that head; it is not deduced, it is found. 
 - HoP 3",205.0
12426,"Thus, as we have already seen  the understanding in act , as also will, desire, love, must be referred to natura naturata, not to natura naturans. 
 - HoP 3",156.0
12428,"Spinoza is unacquainted with an infinity of form, which would be something quite different from that of rigid, unyielding substance. 
 - HoP 3",142.0
12429,"What is requisite is to recognize God as the essence of essences, as universal substance, identity, and yet to preserve distinctions. 
 - HoP 3",143.0
12430,"Spinoza goes on to say: What constitutes the real  existence of the human mind is nothing else than the idea of a particular   thing, that actually exists,  not of an infinite thing. 
 - HoP 3",192.0
12431,"The essence of man involves no necessary existence, ie according to the order of nature a man may just as well be as not be. 
 - HoP 3",134.0
12432,"For the human consciousness, as it does not belong to essence as an attribute, is a mode-a mode of the attribute of thought.

12436,"What therefore determines the mind to thought, is a mode of thought and not of extension; similarly motion and rest of the body must be derived from another body. 
 - HoP 3",172.0
12438,"If, therefore, the body can perceive no qualities of a thing, the soul also can come to no knowledge of it. 
 - HoP 3",117.0
12441,"The souls consciousness expresses a certain determinate form of a Notion, as the Notion itself expresses a determinate form of an individual thing. 
 - HoP 3",157.0
12442,"But the individual thing, its Notion, and the Notion of this Notion are altogether and entirely one and the same thing, only regarded under different attributes. 
 - HoP 3",171.0
12443,"As the soul is nothing else than the immediate Notion of the body, and is one and the same thing with this, the excellence of the soul can never be anything else than the excellence of the body. 
 - HoP 3",204.0
12444,"The capacities of the understanding are nothing but the capacities of the body, if they are looked at from the corporeal point of view, and the decisions of the will are likewise determinations of the body. 
 - HoP 3",216.0
12447,"We have now to speak of Spinozas system of morals, and that is a subject of importance. 
 - HoP 3",97.0
12448,"Its great principle is no other than this, that the finite spirit is moral in so far as it has the true Idea, ie in so far as it directs its knowledge and will on God, for truth is merely the knowledge of God. 
 - HoP 3",219.0
12449,"It may be said that there is no morality loftier than this, since its only requisite is to have a clear idea of God. 
 - HoP 3",126.0
12450,"The first thing Spinoza speaks of in this regard is the affections: Everything strives after self-preservation. 
 - HoP 3",121.0
12451,"This striving is the actual essence of the thing, and involves only indefinite time; when referred exclusively to mind, it is termed will; when referred to both mind and body together, it is called desire. 
 - HoP 3",215.0
12452,"Determination of the will  and Idea are one and the same thing. 
 - HoP 3",73.0
12453,"The sense of liberty rests on this, that men do not know the determining causes of their actions. 
 - HoP 3",107.0
12454,"The affection is a confused idea; the more clearly and distinctly, therefore, we know the affection, the more it is under our control. 
 - HoP 3",144.0
12455,"The more a man recognizes Gods existence and loves Him, the less does he suffer from evil affections and the less is his fear of death. 
 - HoP 3",145.0
12457,"The second kind of knowledge is for Spinoza that which we derive from general conceptions and adequate ideas of the properties of things. 
 - HoP 3",147.0
12458,"The third is intuitive knowledge  which rises from the adequate idea of the formal essence of certain attributes of God to the adequate knowledge of the essence of things. 
 - HoP 3",181.0
12459,"For the necessity of things is the necessity of the eternal nature of God Himself. 
 - HoP 3",92.0
12460,"Every idea of an individual thing necessarily includes the eternal and infinite essence of God in itself. 
 - HoP 3",115.0
12461,"For individual things are modes of an attribute of God; therefore they must include in themselves His eternal essence. 
 - HoP 3",128.0
12462,"Our mind, in so far as it knows itself and the body under the form of eternity, has to that extent necessarily the knowledge of God, and knows that it is itself in God and is conceived through God. 
 - HoP 3",207.0
12463,"All Ideas, in so far as they are referable to God, are true. 
 - HoP 3",70.0
12464,"With Spinoza this is not a knowledge arrived at through philosophy, but only knowledge of a truth. 
 - HoP 3",108.0
12465,"The mind can succeed in tracing back all affections of the body or images of things to God. 
 - HoP 3",101.0
12466,"In proportion as the mind regards all things as necessary, it has a greater power over its affections,  which are arbitrary and contingent. 
 - HoP 3",149.0
12467,"This is the return of the mind to God, and this is human freedom; as mode, on the other hand, the spirit has no freedom, but is determined from without. 
 - HoP 3",162.0
12468,"From the third kind of knowledge there arises the repose of the mind; the supreme good of the mind is to know God, and this is its highest virtue. 
 - HoP 3",156.0
12469,"This knowledge necessarily produces the intellectual love of God; for it produces a joyfulness accompanied by the Idea of God as cause-ie the intellectual love of God. 
 - HoP 3",177.0
12470,"God Himself loves Himself with an infinite intellectual love. 
 - HoP 3",71.0
12471,"This is therefore the purest, but also a universal morality. 
 - HoP 3",70.0
12472,"In the thirty-sixth Letter  Spinoza speaks of Evil. 
 - HoP 3",61.0
12474,"Spinoza says in answer to this: I assert the fact that God absolutely and truly   is the cause of everything that has an essential content   be it what it may. 
 - HoP 3",169.0
12475,"Now if you can prove to me that evil, error, crime, etc, are something that expresses an essence, I will freely admit to you that God is the originator of crime and evil and error. 
 - HoP 3",190.0
12476,"But I have elsewhere abundantly demonstrated that the form of evil cannot subsist in anything that expresses an essence, and therefore it cannot be said that God is the cause of evil. 
 - HoP 3",193.0
12477,"Evil is merely negation, privation, limitation, finality, mode-nothing in itself truly real. 
 - HoP 3",102.0
12478,"Neros murder of his mother, in so far as it had positive content, was no crime. 
 - HoP 3",89.0
12479,"For Orestes did the same external deed, and had in doing it the same end in view-to kill his mother; and yet he is not blamed,  and so on. 
 - HoP 3",148.0
12480,"The affirmative is the will, the intention, the act of Nero. 
 - HoP 3",70.0
12481,"Wherein then consists Neros criminality? In nothing else but that he proved himself ungrateful, merciless, and disobedient. 
 - HoP 3",133.0
12482,"But it is certain that all this expresses no essence, and therefore God was not the cause of it, though He was the cause of Neros action and intention. 
 - HoP 3",161.0
12483,"These last are something positive, but yet they do not constitute the crime as such; it is only the negative element, such as mercilessness, etc that makes the action a crime. 
 - HoP 3",185.0
12485,"It is all very well to say this, but it does not meet the case. 
 - HoP 3",73.0
12486,"For in this way God and the respect to our understanding are different. 
 - HoP 3",81.0
12489,"But in this philosophy it may with justice be objected that God is conceived only as Substance, and not as Spirit, as concrete. 
 - HoP 3",137.0
12490,"The independence of the human soul is therein also denied, while in the Christian religion every individual appears as determined to salvation. 
 - HoP 3",153.0
12491,"Here, on the contrary, the individual spirit is only a mode, an accident, but not anything substantial. 
 - HoP 3",113.0
12492,"This brings us to a general criticism of the philosophy of Spinoza, in the course of which we shall consider it from three different points of view. 
 - HoP 3",158.0
12495,"Those who speak against Spinoza do so as if it were on Gods account that they were interested; but what these opponents are really concerned about is not God, but the finite-themselves. 
 - HoP 3",195.0
12497,"Or, in the second place, God alone exists; the finite has no reality, it is only phenomena, appearance. 
 - HoP 3",113.0
12498,"To say, in the third place, that God exists and we also exist is a false synthetic union, an amicable compromise. 
 - HoP 3",123.0
12499,"It is the popular view of the matter that the one side has as much substantiality as the other; God is honoured and supreme, but finite things also have Being to exactly the same extent. 
 - HoP 3",196.0
12500,"Reason cannot remain satisfied with this also,  with indifference like this. 
 - HoP 3",86.0
12501,"The philosophic requisite is therefore to apprehend the unity of these differences in such a way that difference is not let slip, but proceeds eternally from substance, without being petrified into dualism. 
 - HoP 3",216.0
12502,"Spinoza is raised above this dualism; religion is so also, if we turn its popular conceptions into thoughts. 
 - HoP 3",118.0
12505,"It has been already remarked  that undoubtedly Substance with Spinoza does not perfectly fulfil the conception of God, since it is as Spirit that He is to be conceived. 
 - HoP 3",178.0
12506,"But if Spinoza is called an atheist for the sole reason that he does not distinguish God from the world, it is a misuse of the term. 
 - HoP 3",142.0
12508,"Spinoza maintains that there is no such thing as what is known as the world; it is merely a form of God, and in and for itself it is nothing. 
 - HoP 3",151.0
12509,"The world has no true reality, and all this that we know as the world has been cast into the abyss of the one identity. 
 - HoP 3",129.0
12510,"There is therefore no such thing as finite reality, it has no truth whatever; according to Spinoza what is, is God, and God alone. 
 - HoP 3",140.0
12511,"Therefore the allegations of those who accuse Spinoza of atheism are the direct opposite of the truth; with him there is too much God. 
 - HoP 3",144.0
12512,"They say: If God is the identity of mind and nature, then nature or the individual man is God. 
 - HoP 3",104.0
12513,"This is quite correct, but they forget that nature and the individual disappear in this same identity: and they cannot forgive Spinoza for thus annihilating them. 
 - HoP 3",172.0
12514,"Those who defame him in such a way as this are therefore not aiming at maintaining God, but at maintaining the finite and the worldly; they do not fancy their own extinction and that of the world. 
 - HoP 3",206.0
12515,"Spinozas system is absolute pantheism and monotheism elevated into thought. 
 - HoP 3",85.0
12516,"Spinozism is therefore very far removed from being atheism in the ordinary sense; but in the sense that God is not conceived as spirit, it is atheism. 
 - HoP 3",160.0
12517,"However, in the same way many theologians are also atheists who speak of God only as the Almighty Supreme Being, etc, who refuse to acknowledge God, and who admit the validity and truth of the finite. 
 - HoP 3",210.0
12518,"They are many degrees worse than Spinoza. 
 - HoP 3",51.0
12520,"Even Descartes made it his starting-point that philosophic propositions must be mathematically handled and proved, that they must have the very same evidence as mathematics. 
 - HoP 3",183.0
12522,"The mathematical method is, however, ill-adapted for speculative content, and finds its proper place only in the finite sciences of the understanding. 
 - HoP 3",160.0
12524,"It may be conceded to Jacobi that the method of demonstration leads to Spinozism, if we understand thereby merely the method of knowledge belonging to the understanding. 
 - HoP 3",179.0
12525,"But the fact is that Spinoza is made a testing-point in modern philosophy, so that it may really be said: You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all. 
 - HoP 3",171.0
12526,"This being so, the mathematical and demonstrative method of Spinoza would seem to be only a defect in the external form; but it is the fundamental defect of the whole position. 
 - HoP 3",186.0
12527,"In this method the nature of philosophic knowledge and the object thereof, are entirely misconceived, for mathematical knowledge and method are merely formal in character and consequently altogether unsuited for philosophy. 
 - HoP 3",233.0
12529,"Therefore this Notion as the knowledge of the essence is simply one assumed, which falls within the philosophic subject; and this is what represents itself to be the method peculiar to Spinozas philosophy. 
 - HoP 3",215.0
12531,"He further speaks of axioms, for instance : What is, is either in itself or in another. 
 - HoP 3",97.0
12532,"The determinations in itself  and in another  are not shown forth in their necessity: neither is this disjunction proved, it is merely assumed. 
 - HoP 3",153.0
12533,"The propositions have, as such, a subject and predicate which are not similar. 
 - HoP 3",88.0
12536,"True propositions may, therefore, be looked on as definitions, and the conversion is the proof of the proposition in the form in which it is expressed. 
 - HoP 3",161.0
12538,"What has the form of the subject is in the form of an existent thing, as contrasted with the universal, the content of the proposition. 
 - HoP 3",145.0
12539,"The existent thing is taken as signifying existent in the ordinary sense; it is the word which we use in every-day life, and of which we have a conception that has nothing of the Notion in it. 
 - HoP 3",202.0
12540,"The converse of a proposition would simply read like this: The Notion is that which is thus popularly conceived. 
 - HoP 3",122.0
12541,"This proof from the usage of language-that we also understand this to be the meaning in every-day life, or in other words that the name is correct-has no philosophic significance. 
 - HoP 3",189.0
12543,"Or, in other words, this unity of the two moments is the very thing which the proof has to demonstrate, it is the Notion or the essence. 
 - HoP 3",146.0
12544,"In this case it looks as if the proposition were the matter of chief importance, the truth. 
 - HoP 3",101.0
12545,"But if in these really only so-called propositions, subject and predicate are in truth not alike, because one is individual and the other universal, their relation is essential, ie the reason for which they are one. 
 - HoP 3",225.0
12548,"The proposition is then, as it were, a secondary affair; but we must ask if this proposition is true. 
 - HoP 3",111.0
12549,"The result as proposition ought to be truth, but is only knowledge. 
 - HoP 3",77.0
12550,"The movement of knowledge, as proof, falls therefore, in the third place, outside of the proposition, which ought to be the truth. 
 - HoP 3",140.0
12551,"The essential moments of the system are really already completely contained in the presuppositions of the definitions, from which all further proofs have merely to be deduced. 
 - HoP 3",185.0
12552,"But whence have we these categories which here appear as definitions? We find them doubtless in ourselves, in scientific culture. 
 - HoP 3",139.0
12555,"Therefore God alone is the positive, the affirmative, and consequently the one substance; all other things, on the contrary, are only modifications of this substance, and are nothing in and for themselves. 
 - HoP 3",215.0
12559,"Therefore the case is as in mathematics; a proof is certainly given, conviction must follow, but yet the matter fails to be understood. 
 - HoP 3",145.0
12560,"There is a rigid necessity in the proof, to which the moment of self-consciousness is lacking; the I disappears, gives itself altogether up, merely withers away. 
 - HoP 3",171.0
12561,"Spinozas procedure is therefore quite correct; yet the individual proposition is false, seeing that it expresses only one side of the negation. 
 - HoP 3",153.0
12562,"The understanding has determinations which do not contradict one another; contradiction the understanding cannot suffer. 
 - HoP 3",130.0
12564,"There is lacking the infinite form, spirituality and liberty. 
 - HoP 3",71.0
12565,"I have already mentioned before this  that Lullus and Bruno attempted to draw up a system of form, which should embrace and comprehend the one substance which organizes itself into the universe; this attempt Spinoza did not make. 
 - HoP 3",239.0
12567,"Thought has only the signification of the universal, not of self-consciousness. 
 - HoP 3",89.0
12571,"Thus the soul, the Spirit, in so far as it is an individual Being, is for Spinoza a mere negation, like everything in general that is determined. 
 - HoP 3",155.0
12572,"As all differences and determinations of things and of consciousness simply go back into the One substance, one may say that in the system of Spinoza all things are merely cast down into this abyss of annihilation. 
 - HoP 3",224.0
12573,"But from this abyss nothing comes out; and the particular of which Spinoza speaks is only assumed and presupposed from the ordinary conception, without being justified. 
 - HoP 3",178.0
12574,"Were it to be justified, Spinoza would have to deduce it from his Substance; but that does not open itself out, and therefore comes to no vitality, spirituality or activity. 
 - HoP 3",183.0
12575,"His philosophy has only a rigid and unyielding substance, and not yet spirit; in it we are not at home with ourselves. 
 - HoP 3",128.0
12576,"But the reason that God is not spirit is that He is not the Three in One. 
 - HoP 3",83.0
12579,"This is what we find philosophically inadequate with Spinoza; distinctions are externally present, it is true, but they remain external, since even the negative is not known in itself. 
 - HoP 3",194.0
12580,"Thought is the absolutely abstract, and for that very reason the absolutely negative; it is so in truth, but with Spinoza it is not asserted to be the absolutely negative. 
 - HoP 3",181.0
12584,"On the other hand the negation is present only as Nothing, for in the absolute there is no mode; the negative is not there, but only its dissolution, its return: we do not find its movement, its Becoming and Being. 
 - HoP 3",224.0
12585,"The negative is conceived altogether as a vanishing moment-not in itself, but only as individual self-consciousness; it is not like the Separator we met with in Boehmes system. 
 - HoP 3",186.0
12586,"Self-consciousness is born from this ocean, dripping with the water thereof, ie never coming to absolute self-hood; the heart, the independence is transfixed-the vital fire is wanting. 
 - HoP 3",194.0
12587,"This lack has to be supplied, the moment of self-consciousness has to be added.

12716,"From the other point of view the question of whence they come is a futile one. 
 - HoP 3",88.0
12717,"Mind is undoubtedly determined in itself, for it is the explicitly existent Notion; its development signifies the coming to consciousness.

 - HoP 3",130.0
12728,"Reason is said to be the deriving from principles already known unknown truths. 
 - HoP 3",89.0
12730,"But development in consciousness is something altogether different from any inherent determination of reason, and therefore the expression innate idea is undoubtedly quite wrong.

12739,"To this I answer in a word, from Experience: in that all our knowledge is founded. 
 - HoP 3",92.0
12740,"As to the question in point we must in the first place say that it is true that man commences with experience if he desires to arrive at thought.

12741,"Everything is experienced, not merely what is sensuous, but also what excites and stimulates my mind. 
 - HoP 3",111.0
12742,"Consciousness thus undoubtedly obtains all conceptions and Notions from experience and in experience; the only question is what we understand by experience.

12743,"In a usual way when this is spoken of the idea of nothing particular is conveyed; we speak of it as of something quite well known. 
 - HoP 3",140.0
12745,"Experience thus signifies immediate knowledge, perception, ie I myself must have and be something, and the consciousness of what I have and am is experience. 
 - HoP 3",167.0
12746,"Now there is no question as to this, that whatever we know, of whatever kind it may be, must be experienced, that rests in the conception of the thing. 
 - HoP 3",161.0
12747,"It is absurd to say that one knows anything which is not in experience. 
 - HoP 3",81.0
12748,"I undoubtedly know men, for instance, from experience, without requiring to have seen them all, for I have, as man, activity and will, a consciousness respecting what I am and what others are. 
 - HoP 3",202.0
12749,"The rational exists, ie it is as an existent for consciousness, or this last experiences it; it must be seen and heard, it must be there or have been there as a phenomenon in the world. 
 - HoP 3",195.0
12752,"Locke treats of the various kinds of these ideas imperfectly and empirically merely. 
 - HoP 3",94.0
12753,"According to Locke simple ideas arise partly from outward, and partly from inward experience. 
 - HoP 3",103.0
12754,"For experiences, he says, are in the first place sensations; the other side is reflection, the inward determinations of consciousness. 
 - HoP 3",144.0
12755,"From sensation, from the organs of sight for instance, the conceptions of colour, light, etc, arise; there further arises from outward experience the idea of impenetrability, of figure, rest, motion and such like. 
 - HoP 3",223.0
12756,"From reflections come the ideas of faith, doubt, judgment, reasoning, thinking, willing, etc; from both combined, pleasure, pain, etc This is a very commonplace account of the matter. 
 - HoP 3",193.0
12757,"After Locke has presupposed experience, he goes on to say that it is the understanding which now discovers and desires the universal-the complex ideas. 
 - HoP 3",161.0
12758,"The Bishop of Worcester made the objection that If the idea of substance be grounded upon plain and evident reason, then we must allow an idea of substance which comes not in by sensation or reflection. 
 - HoP 3",212.0
12759,"Locke replies: General ideas come not into the mind by sensation or reflection, but are the creatures or inventions of the understanding. 
 - HoP 3",147.0
12760,"The mind makes them from ideas which it has got by sensation and reflection. 
 - HoP 3",86.0
12762,"The mind in respect of its simple ideas is wholly passive, and receives them all from the existence and operation of things, such as sensation or reflection offers them, without being able to make any one idea. 
 - HoP 3",220.0
12763,"But the mind often exercises an active power in making these several combinations. 
 - HoP 3",92.0
12764,"For it being once furnished with simple ideas it can put them together in several combinations. 
 - HoP 3",105.0
12765,"According to Locke therefore thought itself is not the essence of the soul, but one of its powers and manifestations. 
 - HoP 3",127.0
12766,"He maintains thought to be existent in consciousness as conscious thought, and thus brings it forward as a fact in his experience, that we do not always think. 
 - HoP 3",169.0
12767,"Experience demonstrates dreamless sleep when the sleep is profound. 
 - HoP 3",77.0
12768,"Locke quotes the example of a man who remembered no dream until he had reached his twenty-fifth year.

 - HoP 3",53.0
12771,"But sensuous perception and recollection are thought, and thought is truth. 
 - HoP 3",85.0
12773,"Locke likewise distinguishes  between pure and mixed modes. 
 - HoP 3",69.0
12774,"Pure modes are simple determinations such as power, number, infinitude; in such expressions as causality we reach, on the other hand, a mixed mode. 
 - HoP 3",157.0
12776,"For instance we form the general conception of space from the perception of the distance of bodies by means of sight and feeling. 
 - HoP 3",139.0
12777,"Or in other words, we perceive a definite space, abstract from it, and then we have the conception of space generally; the perception of distances gives us conceptions of space. 
 - HoP 3",187.0
12778,"This however is no deduction, but only a setting aside of other determinations; since distance itself is really space, mind thus determines space from space. 
 - HoP 3",167.0
12779,"Similarly we reach the notion of time through the unbroken succession of conceptions during our waking moments,222 ie from determinate time we perceive time in general. 
 - HoP 3",178.0
12780,"Conceptions follow one another in a continual succession; if we set aside the particular element that is present we thereby receive the conception of time. 
 - HoP 3",165.0
12781,"Substance , a complex idea, hence arises from the fact that we often perceive simple ideas such as blue, heavy, etc, in association with one another. 
 - HoP 3",159.0
12782,"This association we represent to ourselves as something which so to speak supports these simple ideas, or in which they exist. 
 - HoP 3",136.0
12783,"Locke likewise deduces the general conception of power. 
 - HoP 3",65.0
12784,"The determinations of freedom and necessity, cause and effect, are then derived in a similar way. 
 - HoP 3",107.0
12786,"From this observation we get our ideas of cause and effect,  for instance when wax is melted by the fire. 
 - HoP 3",115.0
12787,"Locke goes on to say: Every one, I think, finds in himself a power to begin or forbear, continue or put an end to several actions in himself. 
 - HoP 3",151.0
12788,"From the consideration of the extent of this power of the mind over the actions of the man, which every one finds in himself, arise the ideas of liberty and necessity. 
 - HoP 3",177.0
12789,"We may say that nothing can be more superficial than this derivation of ideas. 
 - HoP 3",88.0
12790,"The matter itself, the essence, is not touched upon at all. 
 - HoP 3",69.0
12791,"A determination is brought into notice which is contained in a concrete relationship; hence the understanding on the one hand abstracts and on the other establishes conclusions. 
 - HoP 3",187.0
12792,"The basis of this philosophy is merely to be found in the transference of the determinate to the form of universality, but it was just this fundamental essence that we had to explain.

12793,"As to this Locke confesses of space, for example, that he does not know what it really is. 
 - HoP 3",100.0
12794,"This so-called analysis by Locke of complex conceptions, and his so-called explanation of the same, has, on account of its uncommon clearness and lucidity of expression, found universal acceptance. 
 - HoP 3",207.0
12797,"That is to say, Locke distinguishes between primary and secondary qualities; the first pertain to the objects themselves in truth, the others are not real qualities, but are founded on the nature of the organs of sensation. 
 - HoP 3",233.0
12798,"Primary qualities are mechanical, like extension, solidity, figure, movement, rest; these are qualities of the corporeal, just as thought is the quality of the spiritual. 
 - HoP 3",180.0
12799,"But the determinations of our individual feelings such as colours, sounds, smells, taste, etc, are not primary. 
 - HoP 3",121.0

 - HoP 3",152.0
12802,"In Locke a difference here appears between the implicit and being for-another, in which he declares the moment of for-another to be unreal-and yet he sees all truth in the relation of for-another only.

 - HoP 3",128.0

 - HoP 3",179.0
12812,"He says they are superfluous, of very little use or of no use at all, for nobody yet has built up a science on a proposition which asserts a contradiction.

 - HoP 3",85.0
12816,"The great end of Philosophy, which is to know the truth, is in it sought to be attained in an empiric way; it thus indeed serves to draw attention to general determinations. 
 - HoP 3",183.0
12818,"It may be held with Wolff that it is arbitrary to begin with concrete conceptions, as when our conception of identity is made to take its origin from such things as blue flowers and the blue heavens.

 - HoP 3",143.0

 - HoP 3",43.0

 - HoP 3",112.0

13019,"It is quite light in a way, but really it is tautology. 
 - HoP 3",65.0
13020,"Of course, if the compound exists, so does the simple, for the compound means something in itself manifold whose connection or unity is external. 
 - HoP 3",155.0
13021,"From the very trivial category of the compound it is easy to deduce the simple. 
 - HoP 3",89.0
13022,"It is a conclusion drawn from a certain premiss, but the question is whether the premiss is true. 
 - HoP 3",107.0
13023,"These monads are not, however, something abstract and simple in itself, like the empty Epicurean atoms, which, as they were in themselves lacking in determination, drew all their determination from their aggregation alone. 
 - HoP 3",232.0
13025,"These monads are not material or extended, nor do they originate or decay in the natural fashion, for they can begin only by a creative act of God, and they can end only by annihilation.

13035,"The system of assistance,  according to Descartes, is something quite superfluous, a Deus ex machina, because continual miracles in the things of nature are assumed. 
 - HoP 3",175.0
13036,"If we, like Descartes, assume independent substances, no causal nexus is conceivable; for this presupposes an influence, a bearing of the one upon the other, and in this way the other is not a substance.

13037,"Therefore there remains only harmony, a unity which is in itself or implicit. 
 - HoP 3",87.0
13038,"The monad is therefore simply shut up in itself, and cannot be determined by another; this other cannot be set into it.

 - HoP 3",190.0
13047,"This is the superficial sense, which does not concern us. 
 - HoP 3",67.0
13048,"The more intimate sense is, however, that each thing is in itself something determined, distinguishing itself from others implicitly or in itself. 
 - HoP 3",156.0
13049,"Whether two things are like or unlike is only a comparison which we make, which falls within our ken. 
 - HoP 3",111.0
13050,"But what we have further to consider is the determined difference in themselves. 
 - HoP 3",90.0
13051,"The difference must be a difference in themselves, not for our comparison, for the subject must have the difference as its own peculiar characteristic or determination, ie the determination must be immanent in the individual.

13052,"Not only do we distinguish the animal by its claws, but it distinguishes itself essentially thereby, it defends itself, it preserves itself. 
 - HoP 3",150.0
13053,"If two things are different only in being two, then each of them is one; but the fact of their being two does not constitute a distinction between them; the determined difference in itself is the principal point. 
 - HoP 3",222.0
13055,"Determinateness and variation such as this, which remains and goes on in the existence itself, is a perception;  and therefore Leibnitz says all monads perceive or represent. 
 - HoP 3",184.0
13056,"In other words, they are in themselves universal, for universality is just simplicity in multiplicity, and therefore a simplicity which is at the same time change and motion of multiplicity. 
 - HoP 3",200.0
13057,"This is a very important determination; in substance itself there is negativity, determinateness, without its simplicity and its implicitude being given up. 
 - HoP 3",166.0
13058,"Further, in it there is this idealism, that the simple is something in itself distinguished, and in spite of its variation, that it yet remains one, and continues in its simplicity.

13059,"An instance of this is found in I,  my spirit.

13060,"I have many conceptions, a wealth of thought is in me, and yet I remain one, notwithstanding this variety of state. 
 - HoP 3",125.0
13061,"This identity may be found in the fact that what is different is at the same time abrogated, and is determined as one; the monads are therefore distinguished by modifications in themselves, but not by external determinations. 
 - HoP 3",235.0
13062,"These determinations contained in the monads exist in them in ideal fashion; this ideality in the monad is in itself a whole, so that these differences are only representations and ideas.

13063,"This absolute difference is what is termed the Notion; what falls asunder in the mere representation is held together. 
 - HoP 3",128.0
13064,"This is what possesses interest in Leibnitzs philosophy. 
 - HoP 3",66.0
13066,"As thus representing, the monad, says Leibnitz, possesses activity; for activity is to be different, and yet to be one, and this is the only true difference. 
 - HoP 3",167.0
13067,"The monad not only represents, it also changes; but in doing so, it yet remains in itself absolutely what it is. 
 - HoP 3",122.0
13068,"This variation is based on activity. 
 - HoP 3",46.0
13069,"The activity of the inner principle, by means of which it passes from one perception to another, is desire. 
 - HoP 3",117.0
13070,"Variation in representation is desire, and that constitutes the spontaneity of the monad; all is now complete in itself, and the category of influence falls away. 
 - HoP 3",172.0
13072,"This is one aspect of things, but the matter is not therein complete; it is equally the case that it is different in respect of other things.

 - HoP 3",76.0
13080,"Matter is nothing else than their passive capability. 
 - HoP 3",63.0
13081,"This passive capability it is which constitutes the obscurity of the representations, or a confusion which never arrives at distinction, or desire, or activity. 
 - HoP 3",170.0
13082,"That is a correct definition of the conception; it is Being, matter, in accordance with the moment of simplicity. 
 - HoP 3",123.0
13083,"This is implicitly activity; mere implicitness without actualization  would therefore be a better expression. 
 - HoP 3",119.0
13084,"The transition from obscurity to distinctness Leibnitz exemplifies by the state of swooning. 
 - HoP 3",102.0
13085,"Seventhly: Bodies as bodies are aggregates of monads: they are mere heaps which cannot be termed substances, any more than a flock of sheep can bear this name. 
 - HoP 3",169.0
13086,"The continuity of the same is an arrangement or extension, but space is nothing in itself;255 it is only in another, or a unity which our understanding gives to that aggregate. 
 - HoP 3",186.0
13087,"Leibnitz goes on to determine and distinguish more clearly as the principal moments, inorganic, organic, and conscious monads, and he does it in the following way. 
 - HoP 3",173.0
13088,"Such bodies as have no inner unity, whose elements are connected merely by space, or externally, are inorganic; they have not an entelechy or one monad which rules over the rest. 
 - HoP 3",188.0
13089,"The continuity of space as a merely external relation has not the Notion in itself of the likeness of these monads in themselves. 
 - HoP 3",139.0
13090,"Continuity is in fact to be regarded in them as an arrangement, a similarity in themselves. 
 - HoP 3",101.0
13091,"Leibnitz therefore defines their movements as like one another, as a harmony in themselves;258 but again, this is as much as saying that their similarity is not in themselves. 
 - HoP 3",185.0
13093,"But to this point Leibnitz does not attain, because for him monads are the absolute principle, and individuality does not annul itself. 
 - HoP 3",145.0
13094,"A higher degree of Being is found in bodies with life and soul, in which one monad has dominion over the rest. 
 - HoP 3",120.0
13095,"The body which is bound up with the monad, of which the one monad is the entelechy or soul, is with this soul named a living creature, an animal. 
 - HoP 3",155.0
13096,"One such entelechy rules over the rest, yet not really, but formally: the limbs of this animal, however, are again themselves such living things, each of which has in its turn its ruling entelechy within it. 
 - HoP 3",217.0
13097,"But ruling is here an inappropriate expression. 
 - HoP 3",57.0
13098,"To rule in this case is not to rule over others, for all are independent; it is therefore only a formal expression. 
 - HoP 3",125.0
13100,"Yet we shall later on come across this relation of the individuals to one another. 
 - HoP 3",92.0
13101,"The conscious monad distinguishes itself from the naked  monads by the distinctness of the representation. 
 - HoP 3",116.0
13104,"These eternal truths rest on two maxims; the one is that of contradiction, the other is that of sufficient reason. 
 - HoP 3",124.0
13106,"The other important principle was, on the other hand: What is not distinguished in thought is not distinguished. 
 - HoP 3",122.0
13107,"The maxim of the reason is that everything has its reason, 260-the particular has the universal as its essential reality. 
 - HoP 3",131.0
13108,"Necessary truth must have its reason in itself in such a manner that it is found by analysis, ie through that very maxim of identity. 
 - HoP 3",143.0
13110,"Sufficient reason seems to be a pleonasm; but Leibnitz understood by this aims, final causes , the difference between which and the causal nexus or the efficient cause he here brings under discussion. 
 - HoP 3",210.0
13111,"The universal itself, absolute essence, which with Leibnitz is something quite different from the monads, separates itself also into two sides, namely universal Being and Being as the unity of opposites. 
 - HoP 3",213.0
13112,"That universal is God, as the cause of the world, to the consciousness of whom the above principle of sufficient reason certainly forms the transition. 
 - HoP 3",161.0
13113,"The existence of God is only an inference from eternal truths; for these must as the laws of nature have a universal sufficient reason which determines itself as none other than God. 
 - HoP 3",192.0
13114,"Eternal truth is therefore the consciousness of the universal and absolute in and for itself; and this universal and absolute is God, who, as one with Himself, the monad of monads, is the absolute Monas. 
 - HoP 3",213.0
13115,"Here we again have the wearisome proof of His existence: He is the fountain of eternal truths and Notions, and without Him no potentiality would have actuality; He has the prerogative of existing immediately in His potentiality. 
 - HoP 3",238.0
13116,"God is here also the unity of potentiality and actuality, but in an uncomprehending manner; what is necessary, but not comprehended, is transferred to Him. 
 - HoP 3",165.0
13117,"Thus God is at first comprehended chiefly as universal, but already in the aspect of the relation of opposites. 
 - HoP 3",121.0
13118,"As regards this second aspect, the absolute relation of opposites, it occurs in the first place in the form of absolute opposites of thought, the good and the evil. 
 - HoP 3",174.0
13119,"God is the Author of the world,  says Leibnitz; that refers directly to evil. 
 - HoP 3",87.0
13120,"It is round this relation that philosophy specially revolves, but to the unity of which it did not then attain; the evil in the world was not comprehended, because no advance was made beyond the fixed opposition. 
 - HoP 3",222.0
13122,"This may very well be said in a general way, but this perfection is no determined thought, but a loose popular expression, a sort of babble respecting an imaginary or fanciful potentiality; Voltaire made merry over it. 
 - HoP 3",228.0
13123,"Nor is the nature of the finite therein defined. 
 - HoP 3",58.0
13124,"Because the world, it is said, has to be the epitome of finite Beings, evil could not be separated from it, since evil is negation, finitude. 
 - HoP 3",151.0
13125,"Reality and negation remain standing in opposition to one another exactly in the same way as before. 
 - HoP 3",110.0
13126,"That is the principal conception in the ThÃ©odicÃ©e. 
 - HoP 3",62.0
13127,"But something very like this can be said in every-day life. 
 - HoP 3",69.0
13128,"If I have some goods brought to me in the market at some town, and say that they are certainly not perfect, but the best that are to be got, this is quite a good reason why I should content myself with them. 
 - HoP 3",217.0
13129,"But comprehension is a very different thing from this. 
 - HoP 3",64.0
13130,"Leibnitz says nothing further than that the world is good, but there is also evil in it; the matter remains just the same as it was before. 
 - HoP 3",149.0
13131,"Because it had to be finite  is then a mere arbitrary choice on the part of God. 
 - HoP 3",90.0
13132,"The next question would be: Why and how is there finitude in the Absolute and His decrees? And only then should there be deduced from the determination of finitude the evil which no doubt exists therein. 
 - HoP 3",213.0
13133,"It is true that Leibnitz has a reply to the above question: God does not will what is evil; evil comes only indirectly into the results  , because oftentimes the greater good could not be achieved if evils were not present. 
 - HoP 3",233.0
13134,"Therefore they are means to a good end. 
 - HoP 3",49.0
13135,"But why does not God employ other means? They are always external, not in and for themselves. 
 - HoP 3",103.0
13136,"A moral evil may not be regarded as a means, nor must we, as the apostle says, do evil that good may come; yet it has often the relation of a conditio sine qua non of the good. 
 - HoP 3",186.0
13137,"Evil is in God only the object of a permissive will ;  but everything that is wrong would be such. 
 - HoP 3",108.0
13138,"God has therefore among the objects of His will the best possible as the ultimate object, but the good as a matter of choice , also as subordinate; and things indifferent and evils often as means. 
 - HoP 3",206.0
13139,"Evil is, however, an object of His will only as the condition of something otherwise necessary , which without it could not exist; in which sense Christ said it must needs be that offences come. 
 - HoP 3",204.0
13140,"In a general sense we are satisfied with the answer: In accordance with the wisdom of God we must accept it as a fact that the laws of nature are the best possible,  but this answer does not suffice for a definite question. 
 - HoP 3",233.0
13141,"What one wishes to know is the goodness of this or that particular law; and to that no answer is given. 
 - HoP 3",113.0
13142,"If, for example, it is said that The law of falling bodies, in which the relation of time and space is the square, is the best possible,  one might employ, as far as mathematics are concerned, any other power whatever. 
 - HoP 3",228.0
13143,"When Leibnitz answers: God made it so,  this is no answer at all. 
 - HoP 3",75.0
13144,"We wish to know the definite reason of this law; such general determinations sound pious, but are not satisfying. 
 - HoP 3",123.0
13145,"He goes on to say that the sufficient reason has reference to the representation of the monads. 
 - HoP 3",105.0
13146,"The principles of things are monads, of which each is for itself, without having influence on the others. 
 - HoP 3",115.0
13147,"If now the Monad of monads, God, is the absolute substance, and individual monads are created through His will, their substantiality comes to an end. 
 - HoP 3",159.0
13149,"Yet at the same time, in order to show the harmony that exists in the world, Leibnitz understands the relation of monads to monads more generally as the unity of contrasted existences, namely of soul and body. 
 - HoP 3",219.0
13150,"This unity he represents as a relation without difference, and notionless, ie as a pre-established harmony. 
 - HoP 3",117.0
13155,"Parallel with this series of differentiated conceptions, there now runs a series of motions of the body, or of what is external to the soul. 
 - HoP 3",150.0
13156,"Both are essential moments of reality; they are mutually indifferent, but they have also an essential relation of difference. 
 - HoP 3",135.0
13158,"God is the sufficient reason, the cause of this correspondence; He has so arranged the multitude of atoms that the original changes which are developed within one monad correspond with the changes of the others. 
 - HoP 3",221.0
13160,"The principle of the harmony among the monads does not consequently belong to them, but it is in God, who for that very reason is the Monad of monads, their absolute unity. 
 - HoP 3",182.0
13161,"We saw from the beginning how Leibnitz arrived at this conception. 
 - HoP 3",76.0
13162,"Each monad is really possessed of the power of representation, and is as such a representation of the universe, therefore implicitly the totality of the whole world. 
 - HoP 3",175.0
13163,"But at the same time this representation is not in consciousness; the naked monad is implicitly the universe, and difference is the development of this totality in it. 
 - HoP 3",177.0
13164,"What develops itself therein is at the same time in harmony with all other developments; all is one harmony. 
 - HoP 3",118.0
13165,"In the universe all things are closely knit together, they are in one piece, like an ocean: the slightest movement transmits its influence far and wide all around. 
 - HoP 3",173.0
13166,"From a single grain of sand, Leibnitz holds, the whole universe might be comprehended in its entire development-if we only knew the sand grain thoroughly. 
 - HoP 3",164.0
13167,"There is not really much in all this, though it sounds very fine; for the rest of the universe is considerably more than a grain of sand, well though we knew it, and considerably different therefrom. 
 - HoP 3",209.0
13168,"To say that its essence is the universe is mere empty talk: for the fact is that the universe as essence is not the universe. 
 - HoP 3",135.0
13169,"To the sand grain much must be added which is not present; and since thought adds more than all the grains of sand that exist, the universe and its development may in this way certainly be comprehended. 
 - HoP 3",212.0
13172,"The magnetic needle, on the contrary, has only spontaneity without consciousness, and consequently without freedom. 
 - HoP 3",125.0
13173,"For, says Leibnitz, the nature of the magnetic needle is to turn to the north; if it had consciousness it would imagine that this was its self-determination; it would thus have the will to move round in accordance with its nature. 
 - HoP 3",240.0
13175,"The law of order, which determines the individuality of the particular substance, has an exact reference to what takes place in every other substance and in the whole universe. 
 - HoP 3",186.0
13177,"An organic whole, a human being, is thus for instance the assertion of his aim from out of himself: at the same time the being directed on something else is involved in his Notion. 
 - HoP 3",190.0
13178,"He represents this and that to himself, he wills this and that; his activity employs itself and brings about changes. 
 - HoP 3",127.0
13179,"His inward determination thus becomes corporeal determination, and then change going beyond himself; he appears as cause, influencing other monads. 
 - HoP 3",157.0
13180,"But this Being-for-another is only an appearance. 
 - HoP 3",59.0
13182,"But if the Being-for-another is mere appearance, the same may be said of Being-for-self; for this has significance only in reference to Being-for-another. 
 - HoP 3",164.0
13184,"The separation in the Notion, which proceeds as far as release from itself, or appearance in distinct independence, Leibnitz did not succeed in bringing together into unity. 
 - HoP 3",183.0
13186,"He moreover considers both of them in one unity, to be sure, but their activity is at the same time not for themselves. 
 - HoP 3",129.0
13189,"Before God the monads are not to be independent, but ideal and absorbed in Him. 
 - HoP 3",89.0
13191,"The word of God is thus the makeshift which leads to a unity which itself is only hypothetical; for the process of the many out of this unity is not demonstrated. 
 - HoP 3",172.0
13192,"God plays therefore in the later philosophy a far greater part than in the early, because now the comprehension of the absolute opposition of thought and Being is the chief demand. 
 - HoP 3",190.0
13194,"In that procedure a beginning is made from the determinate, this and that are stated to be necessary; but since in the next place the unity of these moments is not comprehended, it is transferred to God. 
 - HoP 3",213.0
13195,"God is therefore, as it were, the waste channel into which all contradictions flow: Leibnitzs ThÃ©odicÃ©e is just a popular summing up such as this. 
 - HoP 3",158.0
13197,"These are the main moments of Leibnitzs philosophy. 
 - HoP 3",61.0
13198,"It is a metaphysic which starts from a narrow determination of the understanding, namely, from absolute multiplicity, so that connection can only be grasped as continuity. 
 - HoP 3",181.0
13200,"This is an artificial system, which is founded on a category of the understanding, that of the absoluteness of abstract individuality. 
 - HoP 3",144.0
13201,"What is of importance in Leibnitz lies in the maxims, in the principle of individuality and the maxim of indistinguishability. 
 - HoP 3",136.0
13202,"The philosophy of Wolff is directly connected with that of Leibnitz, for really it is a pedantic systematization of the latter, for which reason it is likewise called the Leibnitz-Wolffian system of philosophy. 
 - HoP 3",220.0
13203,"Wolff attained to great distinction in mathematics and made himself famous by his philosophy as well; the latter was for long predominant in Germany. 
 - HoP 3",159.0
13204,"In Wolff, as a teacher dealing with the understanding, we find a systematic exposition of the philosophic element present in human conceptions as a whole. 
 - HoP 3",164.0
13205,"As regards his connection with German culture generally, great and immortal praise is more especially due to him; before all others he may be termed the teacher of the Germans. 
 - HoP 3",186.0
13206,"We may indeed say that Wolff was the first to naturalize philosophy in Germany. 
 - HoP 3",89.0
13207,"Tschirnhausen and Thomasius likewise participated in this honour, for the special reason that they wrote upon Philosophy in the German language. 
 - HoP 3",154.0
13209,"In this case the universality of thought satisfies us because everything is present there, just as it is present in a moral maxim which has, however, no determinate content in its universality. 
 - HoP 3",203.0
13211,"This is most important from the point of view of culture, and yet it does not really concern us here, excepting in so far as the content in this form of thought has caused itself to be recognized as Philosophy. 
 - HoP 3",220.0

 - HoP 3",169.0

13353,"As against the metaphysic of the understanding, we have the point of view that all existence and its determinations arise from feeling, and are constituted by self-consciousness. 
 - HoP 3",188.0
13354,"Berkeleys first and fundamental thought is consequently this: The Being of whatever is called by us a thing consists alone in its being perceived,  ie our determinations are the objects of our knowledge. 
 - HoP 3",213.0
13356,"A union of different sensuous feelings appears to us to be a particular thing, eg the feeling of colour, taste, smell, figure, &c; for by colours, smells, sounds, something of which we have a sensation is always understood. 
 - HoP 3",233.0
13357,"This is the matter and the object of knowledge; the knower is the percipient I,  which reveals itself in relation to those feelings in various activities, such as imagination, remembrance, and will. 
 - HoP 3",208.0
13358,"Berkeley thus indeed acknowledges the distinction between Being-for-self and Other-Being, which in his case, however, itself falls within the I. 
 - HoP 3",154.0
13360,"But in like manner the manifold sensuous conceptions and feelings can only exist in a mind. 
 - HoP 3",101.0
13361,"Locke certainly distinguished extension and movement, for example, as fundamental qualities, ie as qualities which pertain to the objects in themselves. 
 - HoP 3",162.0
13363,"In Berkeley the relation of things to consciousness is alone dealt with, and beyond this relationship they do not in his view come. 
 - HoP 3",141.0
13364,"From this it follows that it is only self-consciousness that possesses them; for a perception which is not in a conceiving mind is nothing: it is a direct contradiction.

13365,"There can be no substance, he says, which neither conceives nor perceives, and which is yet the substratum of perceptions and conceptions. 
 - HoP 3",148.0
13366,"If it is represented that there is something outside of consciousness which is similar to the conceptions, this is likewise contradictory; a conception can alone be similar to a conception, the idea to the idea alone. 
 - HoP 3",227.0
13368,"For Berkeley brings forward against the present existence of external objects only the inconceivability of the relation of a Being to mind. 
 - HoP 3",149.0
13369,"This inconceivability, however, is destroyed in the Notion, for the Notion is the negative of things; and this moved Berkeley and Leibnitz to shut up the two sides in themselves. 
 - HoP 3",188.0
13370,"There nevertheless remains a relationship of what is other  to us; these feelings do not develop from us as Leibnitz represents, but are determined through somewhat else. 
 - HoP 3",180.0
13371,"When Leibnitz speaks of development within the monads, it is nothing but empty talk; for the monads as they follow in succession have no inward connection. 
 - HoP 3",165.0
13372,"Each individual is thus determined through another, and not through us; and it does not matter what this external is, since it remains a contingent. 
 - HoP 3",158.0
13373,"Now in relation to the two sides of Leibnitz which are indifferent to one another, Berkeley says that such an other  is quite superfluous.

13395,"We must shortly deal with the main aspects of Humes philosophy. 
 - HoP 3",73.0
13396,"He starts directly from the philosophic standpoint of Locke and Bacon, which derives our conceptions from experience, and his scepticism has the idealism of Berkeley as its object. 
 - HoP 3",190.0

 - HoP 3",120.0
13399,"Formerly experience was a mixture of the two elements. 
 - HoP 3",64.0
13401,"All objects of reason are consequently either relations of thoughts such as mathematical axioms, or facts of experience. 
 - HoP 3",130.0
13402,"Since Hume makes these into the content he naturally rejects innate ideas.

13404,"Hume has thus destroyed the objectivity or absolute nature of thought-determinations. 
 - HoP 3",95.0
13405,"Our conviction of the truth of a fact rests on feeling, memory, and the reasonings founded on the causal connection, ie on the relation of cause and effect.

13407,"Hence there is no knowledge and no metaphysics beyond experience. 
 - HoP 3",75.0

 - HoP 3",151.0
13412,"This kind of universality which we connect with necessity, Hume calls custom. 
 - HoP 3",87.0
13413,"Because we have often seen results to follow we are accustomed to regard the connection as a necessary one; the necessity to him is thus a quite contingent association of ideas, which is custom. 
 - HoP 3",204.0
13414,"It is the same thing in respect of the universal. 
 - HoP 3",59.0
13415,"What we perceive are individual phenomena and sensations in which we see that this is now one thing and now another. 
 - HoP 3",126.0
13416,"It may likewise be that we perceive the same determination frequently repeated and in manifold ways. 
 - HoP 3",110.0
13417,"But this is still far removed from universality; universality is a determination which is not given to us through experience. 
 - HoP 3",135.0
13418,"It may be said that this is quite a correct remark on Humes part, if by experience we understand outward experience. 
 - HoP 3",126.0
13419,"Experience is sensible that something exists, but nevertheless the universal is not as yet present in it. 
 - HoP 3",115.0
13421,"But since Hume regards necessity, the unity of opposites, as resting quite subjectively on custom, we cannot get any deeper in thought. 
 - HoP 3",145.0
13422,"Custom is indeed so far a necessity in consciousness, and to this extent we really see the principle of this idealism in it; but in the second place this necessity is represented as something quite devoid of thought or Notion. 
 - HoP 3",236.0
13423,"This custom obtains both in our perception which relates to sensuous nature, and in relation to law and morality. 
 - HoP 3",123.0
13424,"The ideas of justice and morality rest upon an instinct, on a subjective, but very often deceptive moral feeling. 
 - HoP 3",123.0
13425,"From this side Hume considers justice, morality, religious determinations, and disputes their absolute validity. 
 - HoP 3",122.0
13427,"But Hume, like the sceptics of former days, appeals to the various opinions of various nations: amongst different nations and in different times various standards of right have been held.

13428,"What is by one nation called immoral, shameful and irreligious, is by another not considered so at all. 
 - HoP 3",113.0
13430,"We are in the habit of allowing one thing to be just and moral, others have another mode of regarding it. 
 - HoP 3",115.0
13431,"Hence if the truth depends upon experience, the element of universality, of objectivity, &c, comes from elsewhere, or is not justified by experience. 
 - HoP 3",159.0
13432,"Hume thus declared this sort of universality, as he declared necessity, to be rather subjectively than objectively existent; for custom is just a subjective universality of this kind. 
 - HoP 3",193.0
13433,"This is an important and acute observation in relation to experience looked at as the source of knowledge; and it is from this point that the Kantian reflection now begins. 
 - HoP 3",182.0
13434,"Hume  then extended his scepticism to the conceptions and doctrines of freedom and necessity, and to the proofs of the existence of God; and in fact scepticism here possesses a wide field. 
 - HoP 3",198.0
13435,"To such a system of reasoning from thoughts and possibilities another method of reasoning may again be opposed, and this reasoning is no better than the other. 
 - HoP 3",169.0
13437,"But where a universality is found, it does not rest in the matter in itself, but is simply a subjective necessity which is really mere custom. 
 - HoP 3",152.0
13438,"Hence the result which Hume arrives at is necessarily astonishment regarding the condition of human knowledge, a general state of mistrust, and a sceptical indecision-which indeed does not amount to much. 
 - HoP 3",214.0
13440,"But on the other side it is empty, without content or principles of its own; and if a content is in question at all, it must keep to those inclinations.

 - HoP 3",151.0
13442,"In Scotland quite another school of thought developed, and the Scotch are the foremost of Humes opponents; in German philosophy, on the other hand, we have to recognize in Kant another opposing force to that of Hume.

13444,"To the scepticism of Hume they oppose an inward independent source of truth for all that pertains to religion and morality. 
 - HoP 3",133.0
13445,"This coincides with Kant, who also maintains an inward source or spring as against external perception; but in the case of Kant this has quite another form than that which it possesses with the Scottish philosophers. 
 - HoP 3",226.0
13446,"To them this inward independent source is not thought or reason as such, for the content which comes to pass from this inwardness is concrete in its nature, and likewise demands for itself the external matter of experience. 
 - HoP 3",233.0
13447,"It consists of popular principles, which on the one hand are opposed to the externality of the sources of knowledge, and, on the other, to metaphysics as such, to abstract thought or reasoning on its own account.

13482,"The French philosophy has more life, more movement, more spirit; it would perhaps be more correct to describe it as full of life and spirit. 
 - HoP 3",150.0
13483,"It is the absolute Notion, which revolts against the whole reigning system of prevalent conceptions and established ideas, which overthrows all that has settled into fixity, and acquires the consciousness of perfect liberty. 
 - HoP 3",234.0
13485,"All these forms, the real implicitude of the actual world and also of the supersensuous world, are therefore set aside in this spirit conscious of itself. 
 - HoP 3",164.0
13487,"This is the character of the Notion in its actuality; what has reality for this all-perceiving and all-comprehending consciousness is held to be valid. 
 - HoP 3",161.0
13488,"We must now consider what form existence takes for this absolutely comprehending self-consciousness. 
 - HoP 3",110.0
13489,"In the first place this Notion is fixed as the negative movement of the Notion only; the positive and simple, or existence, falls outside of this movement.

13490,"There remains to the Notion no distinction, no content; for all determinate content is lost in that negativity. 
 - HoP 3",121.0
13491,"This empty existence is for us pure thought generally, what the French call Ãªtre suprÃªme, or if represented objectively as existent, and as in opposition to consciousness, it is matter.

13492,"Absolute Being is therefore determined as matter, as empty objectivity, through a Notion which destroys all content and determination, and has as its object this universal alone.

 - HoP 3",142.0
13752,"In Jacobis case the stimulus was given mainly by French philosophy, with which he was very conversant, and also by German metaphysics, while Kant began rather from the English side, that is, from the scepticism of Hume. 
 - HoP 3",229.0
13754,"Kant does not consider the content, but took the view of knowledge being subjective; and for this reason he declared it to be incapable of recognizing absolute existence. 
 - HoP 3",180.0
13755,"To Kant knowledge is thus a knowledge of phenomena only, not because the categories are merely limited and finite, but because they are subjective. 
 - HoP 3",157.0
13756,"To Jacobi, on the other hand, the chief point is that the categories are not merely subjective, but that they themselves are conditioned.

 - HoP 3",72.0
13763,"As a Bavarian official he went to Munich, there became President of the Academy of Sciences in 1804, which office he, however, resigned in 1812; for in the Napoleonic period Protestants were decried as demagogues.

13767,"Mendelssohn was displeased at this, and it was the occasion of the correspondence. 
 - HoP 3",92.0
13769,"That Jacobi asserted Lessing to be a Spinozist, and gave a high place to the French-this serious statement came to these good men as a thunderbolt from the blue.

13771,"Explanations followed upon this, in which Jacobi further developed his philosophic views. 
 - HoP 3",99.0
13772,"Mendelssohn is directly opposed to Jacobi, for Mendelssohn took his stand on cognition, placed true existence immediately in thought and conception, and maintained: What I cannot think as true does not trouble me as doubt.

13773,"A question which I do not understand, I cannot answer, it is for me as good as no question at all.

 - HoP 3",201.0
13782,"Actuality, Being, has its possibility in thought, or its possibility is thought; it is not a process from possibility to actuality, for the possibility remains at home in the actuality. 
 - HoP 3",195.0
13784,"Jacobi thus asserts that mediate knowledge consists in giving a cause of something which has in its turn a finite effect, and so on; so that a knowledge such as this can all through relate to the finite only. 
 - HoP 3",218.0
13786,"We comprehend a thing when we can deduce it from its proximate causes,  and not from the remoter causes; the most remote and quite universal cause is always God.

 - HoP 3",83.0
13791,"Genuine conceptions we have merely of figure, number, position, movement and the forms of thought; qualities are known and understood, if they are traced back to these and objectively annulled. 
 - HoP 3",203.0
13793,"Jacobi continues: The business of reason is really progressive union and connection, and its speculative business is union and connection in accordance with the known laws of necessity, ie of identity. 
 - HoP 3",211.0
13794,"Everything that reason can bring forth by means of analysis, combination, judgment, conclusion, and re-conception, consists in nothing but things of nature  , and reason itself, as a limited existence, belongs to these things. 
 - HoP 3",236.0
13797,"With this Jacobis view of the attempt to know the unconditioned is connected. 
 - HoP 3",87.0
13798,"I take the whole human being, and find that his consciousness is composed of two original conceptions, the conceptions of the conditioned and the unconditioned. 
 - HoP 3",170.0
13799,"Both are inseparably bound up with one another, and yet in such a way that the conception of the conditioned presupposes the conception of the unconditioned, and can be given in this alone. 
 - HoP 3",199.0
13800,"We are just as certain of its existence as we are of our own conditioned existence, or even more so. 
 - HoP 3",110.0
13801,"Since our conditioned existence rests on an infinitude of mediations, there is opened up to our investigation a vast field which, for the sake of our preservation even, we are forced to work upon. 
 - HoP 3",206.0
13802,"It would, however, be quite another thing to wish to know the unconditioned apart from this practical end. 
 - HoP 3",116.0
13804,"For if everything which can be said to arise and be present in a way comprehensible to us, must arise and be present in a conditioned way, we remain, so long as we continue to comprehend, in a chain of conditioned conditions. 
 - HoP 3",235.0
13805,"Where this chain breaks off, we cease to comprehend, and there the connection which we call nature likewise ceases. 
 - HoP 3",125.0
13808,"This is contradictory. 
 - HoP 3",32.0
13809,"Jacobi then passes on from this point to the second of his main propositions, The unconditioned is called the supernatural. 
 - HoP 3",133.0
13811,"It is! This supernatural, this essence of all essence, all tongues join in proclaiming to be God. 
 - HoP 3",107.0
13814,"The consciousness of God, which is in our consciousness, is, however, of such a nature that along with the thought of God we have immediately associated the fact that He is. 
 - HoP 3",183.0
13815,"The existence of the supernatural and supersensuous, to which the thought of man regarding the natural and finite passes on, is just as certain to Jacobi as he is himself. 
 - HoP 3",181.0
13816,"This certainty is identical with his self-consciousness; as certainly as I am, so certainly is God. 
 - HoP 3",109.0
13817,"Since he thus passes back into self-consciousness, the unconditioned is only for us in an immediate way; this immediate knowledge Jacobi calls Faith, inward revelation ; to this appeal can be made in man. 
 - HoP 3",214.0
13818,"God, the absolute, the unconditioned, cannot, according to Jacobi, be proved. 
 - HoP 3",87.0
13819,"For proof, comprehension, means to discover conditions for something, to derive it from conditions; but a derived absolute, God, &c, would thus not be absolute at all, would not be unconditioned, would not be God. 
 - HoP 3",223.0
13820,"This immediate knowledge of God is then the point which is maintained in the philosophy of Jacobi. 
 - HoP 3",108.0
13821,"The faith of Kant and of Jacobi are, however, different. 
 - HoP 3",66.0
13822,"To Kant it is a postulate of reason, it is the demand for the solution of the contradiction between the world and goodness; to Jacobi it is represented on its own account as immediate knowledge. 
 - HoP 3",204.0
13824,"Revelation as immediate knowledge is in ourselves, while the Church holds revelation to be something imparted from without. 
 - HoP 3",133.0
13825,"In the theological sense, faith is faith in something which is given to us through teaching. 
 - HoP 3",102.0
13827,"This is Jacobis standpoint, and whatever is by philosophers and theologians said against it, this teaching is eagerly accepted and disseminated. 
 - HoP 3",154.0
13829,"It is, indeed, allowed that a man cannot make shoes unless he is a shoemaker, even although he have the measure and foot, and also the hands. 
 - HoP 3",151.0
13830,"But when Philosophy is concerned, immediate knowledge signifies that every man as he walks and stands is a philosopher, that he can dogmatize as he chooses, and that he is completely acquainted with Philosophy. 
 - HoP 3",220.0
13831,"By reason, however, mediate knowledge merely is on the one hand understood, and on the other the intellectual perception which speaks of facts. 
 - HoP 3",153.0
13832,"In this respect it is true that reason is the knowledge and revelation of absolute truth, since the understanding is the revelation of the finite. 
 - HoP 3",156.0
13833,"We maintained that two different powers of perception in man have to be accepted: a power of perception through visible and tangible and consequently corporeal organs of perception, and another kind of power, viz. 
 - HoP 3",223.0
13834,"This organ, a spiritual eye for spiritual objects, has been called by men-generally speaking-reason. 
 - HoP 3",110.0
13837,"We obtain all conceptions through the qualities which we receive and accept, and there is no other way of attaining real knowledge; for reason, when it begets objects, begets phantoms of the brain. 
 - HoP 3",207.0
13838,"Thus we have a revelation of nature. 
 - HoP 3",46.0
13839,"Hence the expression faith, which had a deep significance in religion, is made use of for different contents of every kind; this in our own time is the point of view most commonly adopted. 
 - HoP 3",198.0
13840,"Jacobi here brings faith into opposition with thought. 
 - HoP 3",64.0
13841,"Let us compare the two, and discover whether they are separated by so great a chasm as those who thus oppose them think. 
 - HoP 3",130.0
13842,"On the one hand absolute existence is to faith immediate; believing consciousness feels itself penetrated by this as by its essence: that existence is its life, believing consciousness asserts itself to be in direct unity with it. 
 - HoP 3",240.0
13843,"Thought thinks the absolute existence; such existence is to it absolute thought, absolute understanding, pure thought; but that signifies that it is likewise immediate itself. 
 - HoP 3",185.0
13844,"On the other hand to faith the immediacy of absolute existence has also the significance of a Being: it is, and is another than I. 
 - HoP 3",140.0
13845,"And the same is true of the thinker; to him it is absolute Being, actual in itself, and different from self-consciousness or thought as finite understanding, to use the common term. 
 - HoP 3",191.0
13847,"But it expresses this simple unity; in its consciousness it is only immediacy so to speak in the signification of Being, a unity of its unconscious substance. 
 - HoP 3",168.0
13848,"In the second place Being-for-self is contained in thought; to this faith opposes the immediacy of Being. 
 - HoP 3",115.0
13849,"Thought, on the contrary, has the immediate as absolute potentiality, as absolutely a thing of thought: and the immediacy belonging to this thing of thought is without the determination of Being, of life. 
 - HoP 3",214.0
13850,"On the heights of this abstraction the two stand opposed to each other, as the AufklÃ¤rung which asserts absolute existence to be a Beyond of self-consciousness, and as the materialism which makes it so to speak present matter. 
 - HoP 3",237.0
13852,"Hence faith and thought are both of them knowledge. 
 - HoP 3",61.0
13853,"We call universal knowledge thought, particular knowledge we call sensuous perception; and we term the introduction of external determinations understanding. 
 - HoP 3",167.0
13855,"Thus God, even though He is only felt and believed in, is yet the universal taken quite abstractly-even in His personality He is the absolutely universal personality. 
 - HoP 3",176.0
13856,"As thought and faith are thus one, the same is true of the antithesis between mediated and immediate knowledge. 
 - HoP 3",121.0
13857,"We must, it is true, keep before our eyes the fact that what is revealed in immediate knowledge is the universal. 
 - HoP 3",123.0
13858,"But abstract immediate knowledge is natural, sensuous knowledge; the immediate man in his natural condition, in his desires, does not know this universal. 
 - HoP 3",164.0
13859,"Children, the Esquimaux, &c, know nothing of God; or what the natural man knows of Him is not a real knowledge of Him. 
 - HoP 3",128.0
13860,"Thus the intuitive knowledge of the Egyptians told them that God was an ox or a cat, and the Indians still possess similar sorts of knowledge. 
 - HoP 3",152.0
13863,"I think, and thus I know the universal immediately, but this very thought is just process in itself, movement and life. 
 - HoP 3",129.0
13864,"All life is process within itself, is mediated, and this is all the more true of spiritual life; for it is the passing from one to the other, that is, from the merely natural and sensuous to the spiritual. 
 - HoP 3",215.0
13865,"It thus indicates a deficiency in the most simple reflection not to know that the universal is not in immediate knowledge, but is a result of the culture, the education, and the self-revelation of the human race. 
 - HoP 3",222.0
13866,"If immediate knowledge is to be allowed, everyone will be responsible merely to himself: this man knows this, another that, and consequently everything is justified and approved, however contrary to right and religion. 
 - HoP 3",228.0
13868,"If Philosophy were to result in this it would be a poor affair; these determinations are merely forms, none of which has intrinsic truth. 
 - HoP 3",147.0
13869,"The form into which Philosophy has in Jacobis case finally fallen, which is that immediacy is grasped as absolute, manifests a lack of all critical faculty, of all logic. 
 - HoP 3",180.0
13870,"The Kantian philosophy is critical philosophy, but from it the fact has been omitted that we cannot constitute the infinite with finite categories-and immediacy is such an one. 
 - HoP 3",186.0
13871,"When we regard this opposition more closely all knowledge may be termed immediate, but all immediate knowledge is likewise mediated in itself.

 - HoP 3",100.0

13875,"That which we now know immediately is consequently a result of infinitely many mediations. 
 - HoP 3",100.0
13878,"Knowledge, however, is something very different from what Jacobi calls such; against finite knowledge his arguments are quite correct. 
 - HoP 3",144.0
13879,"Immediate knowledge is not knowledge, comprehension, for that implies that the content is determined in itself, ie is grasped as concrete. 
 - HoP 3",148.0
13880,"But in immediate knowledge it is the case that the only fact known of God is that He exists. 
 - HoP 3",102.0
13881,"For should there be determinations respecting God, they must, according to Jacobi, be grasped as a finite, and the knowledge of them would again merely be a progression from finite to finite.

13882,"There thus remains only the indeterminate conception of God, an Above me,  an indeterminate Beyond.

 - HoP 3",130.0
13891,"The philosophy of Kant, which we have now more particularly to consider, made its appearance at the same time as the above. 
 - HoP 3",133.0

13982,"But here the doctrine of intuition or perception is taken from the point of view of its universality, ie from what in it pertains to the subject as such. 
 - HoP 3",163.0
13983,"Perception, says Kant, is the knowledge of an object given to us through the senses; sensuousness, however, is the capacity of being affected by conceptions as external. 
 - HoP 3",179.0
13987,"Space and time are consequently pure, ie abstract perceptions in which we place outside of us the content of individual sensations, either in time as succeeding one another, or in space as separate from one another. 
 - HoP 3",225.0
13988,"Here we thus meet with the division between subjectivity and objectivity, for if we isolate the alongside of and after we have space and time. 
 - HoP 3",152.0
13989,"It is the act of a priori sensuousness to project the content; the forms of intuition or perception constitute this pure perception. 
 - HoP 3",142.0
13990,"Now everything indeed is termed perception, even thought and consciousness; God, who certainly pertains to thought alone, is said to be comprehended by perception or intuition, the so-called immediate consciousness. 
 - HoP 3",225.0
13991,"Kant further remarks in this regard,  Space is no empirical Notion which has been derived from outward experiences. 
 - HoP 3",125.0
13992,"But the Notion is never really anything empiric: it is in barbarous forms like this that Kant, however, always expresses himself: For in order that I may relate my sensations to something outside of me, I must presuppose space. 
 - HoP 3",237.0
13994,"That is to say, time and space which may appear as objective, since their particular filling in certainly belongs to subjective feeling, are not empirical; for consciousness has time and space first of all in itself. 
 - HoP 3",226.0
13995,"Space is a necessary conception which lies at the basis of all external perceptions. 
 - HoP 3",94.0
13996,"Space and time are conceptions a priori, because we cannot represent things without space and time. 
 - HoP 3",109.0
13997,"Time is a necessary basis for all phenomena. 
 - HoP 3",54.0
13998,"As a priori, space and time are universal and necessary, that is to say we find this to be the case; but it does not follow that they must be previously present as conceptions. 
 - HoP 3",186.0
13999,"They are fundamental indeed, but they are likewise an external universal. 
 - HoP 3",83.0
14002,"Space and time are not general Notions of the relations of things, but pure intuitive perceptions. 
 - HoP 3",108.0
14003,"For we can only represent to ourselves one space; there are not different component parts of space. 
 - HoP 3",109.0
14004,"The same is the case with time. 
 - HoP 3",41.0
14005,"The abstract conception tree, for example, is in its actuality a number of individual and separate trees, but spaces are not such particulars, nor are they parts; for one immediate continuity remains, and hence a simple unity. 
 - HoP 3",236.0
14006,"Ordinary perception has always something individual before it; space or time are always however one only, and therefore a priori. 
 - HoP 3",139.0
14007,"It might however be replied to Kant: The nature of space and time undoubtedly involves their being an abstract universal; but there is in like manner only one blue. 
 - HoP 3",174.0
14009,"Space and time, then, are certainly not thought-determinations, if no thoughts are there present, but a Notion, so soon as we have a Notion of them. 
 - HoP 3",158.0
14010,"From the transcendental point of view it is likewise maintained that this conception of space and time contains synthetic propositions a priori, connected with the consciousness of its necessity. 
 - HoP 3",205.0
14011,"All these propositions are however very analytic. 
 - HoP 3",59.0
14013,"In the second place he states that we acquire them from pure sensuous perception, and not through the understanding or Notion. 
 - HoP 3",136.0
14014,"But Kant does not grasp the two together, and yet this comprehension of them is involved in such propositions being immediately certain even in ordinary perception. 
 - HoP 3",174.0
14016,"But what the nature of time and space is, it does not occur to the Kantian philosophy to inquire. 
 - HoP 3",107.0

 - HoP 3",151.0
14018,"The second faculty, the understanding, is something very different from sensuousness; the latter is Receptivity, while Kant calls thought in general Spontaneity-an expression which belongs to the philosophy of Leibnitz. 
 - HoP 3",229.0
14019,"The understanding is active thought, I myself; it is the faculty of thinking the object of sensuous perception. 
 - HoP 3",121.0
14020,"Yet it has thoughts merely without real content: Thoughts without content are void and empty, sensuous perceptions without Notions are blind. 
 - HoP 3",151.0
14021,"The understanding thus obtains from the sensuous its matter, both empirical and a priori, time and space; and it thinks this matter, but its thoughts are very different from this matter. 
 - HoP 3",196.0
14022,"Or it is a faculty of a particular kind, and it is only when both occur, when the sensuous faculty has supplied material and the understanding has united to this its thoughts, that knowledge results. 
 - HoP 3",209.0
14023,"The thoughts of the understanding as such are thus limited thoughts, thoughts of the finite only. 
 - HoP 3",107.0
14024,"Now logic, as transcendental logic, likewise sets forth the conceptions which the understanding has a priori in itself and whereby it thinks objects completely a priori. 
 - HoP 3",179.0
14025,"Thoughts have a form which signifies their being the synthetic function which brings the manifold into a unity. 
 - HoP 3",121.0

 - HoP 3",104.0

14028,"This is a barbarous exposition of the matter.

14030,"In order that a content may enter this One, it must be infected by its simplicity; it is thus that the content first becomes my content. 
 - HoP 3",146.0
14031,"The comprehending medium is I; whatever I have to do with must allow itself to be forced into these forms of unity. 
 - HoP 3",125.0
14032,"This is a great fact, an important item of knowledge; what thought produces is unity; thus it produces itself, for it is the One. 
 - HoP 3",139.0
14033,"Yet the fact that I am the one and, as thinking, the simplifier, is not by Kant satisfactorily set forth. 
 - HoP 3",115.0
14034,"The unity may likewise be called relation; for in so far as a manifold is presupposed, and as this on the one side remains a manifold while on the other side it is set forth as one, so far may it be said to be related. 
 - HoP 3",228.0
14036,"But Kant  approaches these modes of simplicity by accepting them as they are classified in ordinary logic. 
 - HoP 3",116.0
14037,"For he says that in common logic particular kinds of judgment are brought forward; and since judgment is a special kind of relationship of the manifold, the various functions of thought which I has in it are shown therein. 
 - HoP 3",232.0
14038,"But the following kinds of judgment have been noticed, viz. 
 - HoP 3",69.0
14039,"Universal, Particular and Singular; Affirmative, Negative, Infinite; Categorical, Hypothetical, Disjunctive; Assertoric, Problematic and Apodictic judgments. 
 - HoP 3",167.0
14040,"These particular modes of relationship now brought forward are the pure forms of the understanding. 
 - HoP 3",109.0
14041,"There are thus, according to Kant , twelve fundamental categories, which fall into four classes; and it is noteworthy, and deserves to be recognized, that each species of judgment again constitutes a triad. 
 - HoP 3",216.0
14042,"The first kind of categories are those of Quantity, viz. 
 - HoP 3",66.0
14043,"Plurality is negation of the one, the assertion of difference; and the third, the bringing of the other two into one, plurality circumscribed, the indeterminate plurality comprehended as one, is the Totality. 
 - HoP 3",218.0
14044,"In the second series are the categories of Quality: Reality, Negation, Limitation. 
 - HoP 3",92.0
14045,"Limitation is as real or positive as negation. 
 - HoP 3",56.0
14047,"The categories of Modality, of the relation of the objective to our thought, come fourth, viz. 
 - HoP 3",104.0
14048,"Possibility should come second; in abstract thought, however, the empty conception comes first. 
 - HoP 3",105.0
14049,"It betrays a great instinct for the Notion when Kant says that the first category is positive, the second the negative of the first, the third the synthesis of the two. 
 - HoP 3",178.0
14050,"The triplicity, this ancient form of the Pythagoreans, Neo-Platonists and of the Christian religion, although it here reappears as a quite external schema only, conceals within itself the absolute form, the Notion. 
 - HoP 3",224.0
14051,"But since Kant says that a conception can determine itself in me as accidental, as cause, effect, unity, plurality, &c, we thereby have the whole of the metaphysics of the understanding. 
 - HoP 3",196.0
14052,"Kant does not follow up further the derivation of these categories, and he finds them imperfect, but he says that the others are derived from them. 
 - HoP 3",157.0
14053,"Kant thus accepts the categories in an empiric way, without thinking of developing of necessity these differences from unity. 
 - HoP 3",135.0
14054,"Just as little did Kant attempt to deduce time and space, for he accepted them likewise from experience-a quite unphilosophic and unjustifiable procedure. 
 - HoP 3",164.0
14057,"For the laws of the heavens are not immediately perceived, but merely the change in position on the part of the stars. 
 - HoP 3",128.0
14058,"It is only when this object of immediate perception is laid hold of and brought under universal thought-determinations that experience arises therefrom, which has a claim to validity for all time. 
 - HoP 3",206.0
14060,"Our finding both these elements in experience demonstrates indeed that a correct analysis has been made. 
 - HoP 3",114.0
14062,"For the first component part of experience, sensation, is doubtless subjective, since it is connected with our organs. 
 - HoP 3",128.0
14063,"The matter of perception is only what it is in my sensation. 
 - HoP 3",70.0
14064,"I know of this sensation only and not of the thing. 
 - HoP 3",61.0
14066,"Neither the one nor the other is consequently anything in itself, nor are both together, knowledge, anything in itself, for it only knows phenomena-a strange contradiction. 
 - HoP 3",182.0
14068,"This is dealt with by the transcendental faculty of judgment. 
 - HoP 3",71.0
14070,"The connection of these two is again one of the most attractive sides of the Kantian philosophy, whereby pure sensuousness and pure understanding, which were formerly expressed as absolute opposites, are now united. 
 - HoP 3",225.0
14073,"Thus, for example, the conception of substance in the schema becomes permanent in time,340 ie the pure conception of the understanding, the pure category, is brought into unity with the form of pure sensuous perception. 
 - HoP 3",229.0
14074,"In as far as we have to deal with our own determinations only and as we do not reach the implicit, the true objective, the Kantian philosophy called itself Idealism. 
 - HoP 3",175.0
14075,"But in this connection Kant  brings forward a refutation of empirical or material idealism, thus: I am conscious of my existence as determined in time. 
 - HoP 3",161.0
14076,"But all time-determination presupposes something permanent in perception. 
 - HoP 3",83.0
14077,"This permanence cannot be  a sensuous perception in me. 
 - HoP 3",65.0
14079,"Or I am conscious of my existence as of an empirical consciousness which is only capable of being determined in relation to something which is outside of me; ie I am conscious of something external to me. 
 - HoP 3",214.0
14080,"Conversely it may be said: I am conscious of external things as determined in time and as changing; these hence presuppose something constant which is not in them but outside of them. 
 - HoP 3",193.0
14081,"And this is I, the transcendental ground of their universality and necessity, of their implicitude, the unity of self-consciousness. 
 - HoP 3",142.0
14082,"On another occasion Kant regards it thus : These moments confuse themselves, because the constant element is itself a category. 
 - HoP 3",137.0
14085,"The truth or untruth does not rest in their being things or conceptions, but in their limitation and contingency, whether as conceptions or things. 
 - HoP 3",157.0
14086,"The refutation of this idealism is nothing more than calling attention to the fact that this empirical consciousness does not exist in itself-just as those empiric things do not exist in themselves. 
 - HoP 3",208.0
14087,"But the knowing subject does not with Kant really arrive at reason, for it remains still the individual self-consciousness as such, which is opposed to the universal. 
 - HoP 3",176.0
14088,"As a matter of fact there is described in what we have seen only the empirical finite self-consciousness which requires a material from outside, or which is limited. 
 - HoP 3",175.0
14089,"We do not ask whether these facts of knowledge are in and for themselves true or untrue; the whole of knowledge remains within subjectivity, and on the other side there is the thing-in-itself as an external. 
 - HoP 3",217.0
14090,"This subjectivity is however concrete in itself; even the determinate categories of the thinking understanding are concrete, and much more is experience so-the synthesis of the sensation and the category. 
 - HoP 3",214.0
14092,"It would make no difference if there had been no Reason there, just as with physicists it is a matter of perfect indifference whether, for instance, there is such a thing as magnetism or not. 
 - HoP 3",201.0
14095,"But the categories are themselves particular. 
 - HoP 3",55.0
14096,"The principle of reason, according to Kant, is really the universal, inasmuch as it finds the unconditioned involved in the conditioned knowledge of the understanding. 
 - HoP 3",177.0
14097,"Understanding is hence for him thought in finite relations; reason, on the contrary, is thought which makes the unconditioned its object. 
 - HoP 3",147.0
14098,"Since Kants time it has become customary in the language of philosophy to distinguish understanding and reason, while by earlier philosophers this distinction was not drawn. 
 - HoP 3",183.0
14099,"The product of reason is, according to Kant, the Idea-a Platonic expression-and he understands by it the unconditioned, the infinite. 
 - HoP 3",143.0
14100,"It is a great step forward to say that reason brings forth Ideas; with Kant, however, the Idea is merely the abstract universal, the indeterminate. 
 - HoP 3",157.0
14101,"This, the unconditioned, must now be grasped as concrete, and therein lies the main difficulty. 
 - HoP 3",105.0
14102,"For to know the unconditioned means to determine it and to deduce its determinations. 
 - HoP 3",95.0
14103,"Much has been written and said on the subject of knowledge, without a definition of it ever having been offered. 
 - HoP 3",122.0
14104,"But it is the business of Philosophy to see that what is taken for granted as known is really known. 
 - HoP 3",110.0
14105,"Now on this point Kant says that reason has certainly the desire to know the infinite, but has not the power. 
 - HoP 3",119.0
14107,"It depends, however, on how the world is looked at; but experience and observation of the world mean nothing else for Kant than a candlestick standing here, and a snuff-box standing there. 
 - HoP 3",198.0
14109,"But no one wishes to demand a sensuous proof in verification of the infinite; spirit is for spirit alone. 
 - HoP 3",115.0
14112,"Although reason, says Kant, becomes transcendent by the exhibition of these contradictions, it still retains its claim to trace perception, experience, and knowledge pertaining to the understanding, back to the infinite. 
 - HoP 3",230.0
14113,"This union of the infinite, the unconditioned, with the finite and conditioned as existing in the knowledge given by the understanding, or even in perception, would signify that the acme of concreteness had been reached. 
 - HoP 3",230.0
14114,"Of this Unconditioned there are several kinds, objects having special features of their own and proceeding from reason, transcendental Ideas; they are thus themselves particular in their nature. 
 - HoP 3",204.0
14115,"The manner in which Kant arrives at these Ideas is again derived from experience, from formal logic, according to which there are various forms of the syllogism. 
 - HoP 3",171.0
14116,"Because, says Kant, there are three forms of the syllogism, categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive, the Unconditioned is also three-fold in its nature: Firstly, an Unconditioned of the categorical synthesis in a subject. 
 - HoP 3",234.0
14117,"Synthesis is the concrete; but the expression is ambiguous, since it indicates an external association of independent elements. 
 - HoP 3",137.0
14118,"In the second place, an Unconditioned of the hypothetical synthesis of the members of a series will have to be looked for; and in the third place, an Unconditioned of the disjunctive synthesis of the parts in a system. 
 - HoP 3",228.0
14120,"When brought to an ultimate point, the question which meets us is whether Reason can bring these objects to reality, or whether they remain confined to subjective thought. 
 - HoP 3",181.0
14121,"Now, according to Kant, Reason is not capable of procuring reality for its Ideas-otherwise it would be transcendent, its limits would be overstepped; it produces only paralogisms, antinomies, and an ideal without reality. 
 - HoP 3",231.0
14122,"Since Reason credits with reality that mode of the Unconditioned which constitutes the categorical synthesis in a subject, and therefore the thinking subject, it is termed substance. 
 - HoP 3",192.0
14123,"Now is the thinking ego a substance, a soul, a soul-thing? Further questions are whether it is permanent, immaterial, incorruptible, personal and immortal, and such as to have a real community with the body. 
 - HoP 3",217.0
14124,"The falsity of the syllogism consists in this, that the idea of the unity of the transcendental subject essential to Reason is expressed as a thing; for it is only in this way that the permanency of the same becomes substance. 
 - HoP 3",236.0
14125,"Otherwise I find myself permanent in my thought, of course, but only within perceiving consciousness, not outside of that. 
 - HoP 3",132.0
14126,"The ego is therefore the empty, transcendental subject of our thoughts, that moreover becomes known only through its thoughts; but of what it is in itself we cannot gather the least idea. 
 - HoP 3",197.0
14128,"We therefore know very well that the ego is a subject, but if we pass beyond self-consciousness, and say that it is substance, we go farther than we are entitled to do. 
 - HoP 3",178.0
14129,"I cannot therefore assign any reality to the subject. 
 - HoP 3",63.0
14130,"We here see Kant fall into contradiction, what with the barbarity of the conceptions which he refutes, and the barbarity of his own conceptions which remain behind when the others are refuted. 
 - HoP 3",202.0
14132,"But, in the second place, Kant does not assert the contrary of this, namely that the ego, as this universal or as self-thinking, has in itself the true reality which he requires as an objective mode. 
 - HoP 3",209.0
14133,"For he does not get clear of the conception of reality in which reality consists in the possession of a sensuous present existence; accordingly, because the ego is given in no outward experience, it is not real. 
 - HoP 3",221.0
14134,"For self-consciousness, the ego as such, is not, according to Kant, reality; it is only our thought, or in other words he regards self-consciousness as being itself simply and entirely sensuous. 
 - HoP 3",204.0
14135,"The form which Kant accordingly bestows on Being, thing, substance, would seem to indicate that these categories of the understanding were too high for the subject, too high to be capable of being predicated of it. 
 - HoP 3",224.0
14136,"But really such determinations are too poor and too mean, for what possesses life is not a thing, nor can the soul, the spirit, the ego, be called a thing. 
 - HoP 3",165.0
14137,"Being is the least or lowest quality that one can assign to spirit, its abstract, immediate identity with itself; Being thus no doubt pertains to spirit, but it must be considered as a determination scarcely worth applying to it. 
 - HoP 3",239.0
14138,"In the second place we have the antinomy, ie the contradiction in Reasons Idea of the Unconditioned, an Idea applied to the world in order to represent it as a complete summing-up of conditions. 
 - HoP 3",204.0
14140,"If now this completeness is expressed as existing, an antinomy is alone presented, and Reason is presented only as dialectic: ie in this object there is on every side a perfect contradiction found. 
 - HoP 3",207.0
14142,"Reason demands a perfectly complete synthesis, an absolute beginning; but in phenomena we have, on the contrary, a succession of causes and effects, which never come to an end. 
 - HoP 3",186.0
14143,"Kant here points out four contradictions , which, however, is not enough; for in each Notion there are antinomies, since it is not simple but concrete, and therefore contains different determinations, which are direct opposites. 
 - HoP 3",238.0
14144,"These antinomies in the first place involve our making the one determination, limitation, just as valid as non-limitation. 
 - HoP 3",132.0
14145,"Thesis: The world has a beginning and an end in time, and it is limited in regard to space. 
 - HoP 3",101.0
14146,"Antithesis: It has no beginning and no end in time, and also no limits in space. 
 - HoP 3",90.0
14147,"The one, says Kant, can be proved just as easily as the other; and indeed he does prove each indirectly, though his are not advocates proofs. 
 - HoP 3",151.0
14148,"The world, as the universe, is the whole; it is thus a universal idea, and therefore unlimited. 
 - HoP 3",105.0
14149,"The completion of the synthesis in progression as regards time and space is, however, a first beginning of time and space. 
 - HoP 3",132.0
14150,"If therefore the categories of limited and unlimited are applied to the world in order to attain to a knowledge of it, we fall into contradictions, because the categories are not applicable to things-in-themselves. 
 - HoP 3",224.0
14151,"The second antinomy is that atoms, from which substance is composed, must necessarily be admitted to exist, therefore simplicity can be proved; but just as easy is it to prove incompleteness, the endless process of division. 
 - HoP 3",234.0
14152,"The thesis is accordingly stated thus: Every compound substance consists of simple parts,  and the antithesis is as follows: There exists nothing simple. 
 - HoP 3",163.0
14153,"The one is here the limit, a material self-existence, the point which is likewise the enclosing surface; the other is divisibility ad infinitum. 
 - HoP 3",154.0
14154,"The third antinomy is the opposition between freedom and necessity. 
 - HoP 3",77.0
14155,"The first is the self-determining, the point of view pertaining to infinity: causality according to the laws of freedom is the only causality. 
 - HoP 3",152.0
14156,"The other is: Determinism alone is to be found: everything is determined by means of an external ground or reason. 
 - HoP 3",124.0
14158,"The absolute necessity of the conditioned world is therefore on the one hand maintained thus: To the world belongs an absolutely necessary Being. 
 - HoP 3",155.0
14159,"The opposite to this is, There exists no absolutely necessary Being, either as part of the world or outside of the world. 
 - HoP 3",131.0
14160,"One of these opposites is just as necessary as the other, and it is superfluous to carry this further here. 
 - HoP 3",117.0
14161,"The necessity of these contradictions is the interesting fact which Kant  has brought to consciousness; in ordinary metaphysics, however, it is imagined that one of these contradictions must hold good, and the other be disproved. 
 - HoP 3",239.0
14162,"The most important point involved in this assertion of Kants is, however, unintentional on his part. 
 - HoP 3",110.0
14164,"If such determinations belonged to the world, to God, to free agents, there would be an objective contradiction; but this contradiction is not found as absolute, it pertains only to us. 
 - HoP 3",195.0
14165,"Or, in other words, this transcendental idealism lets the contradiction remain, only it is not Being in itself that is thus contradictory, for the contradiction has its source in our thought alone. 
 - HoP 3",207.0
14166,"Thus the same antinomy remains in our mind; and as it was formerly God who had to take upon Himself all contradictions, so now it is self-consciousness. 
 - HoP 3",162.0
14167,"But the Kantian philosophy does not go on to grapple with the fact that it is not things that are contradictory, but self-consciousness itself. 
 - HoP 3",153.0
14168,"Experience teaches that the ego does not melt away by reason of these contradictions, but continues to exist; we need not therefore trouble ourselves about its contradictions, for it can bear them. 
 - HoP 3",207.0
14169,"Nevertheless Kant shows here too much tenderness for things: it would be a pity, he thinks, if they contradicted themselves. 
 - HoP 3",134.0
14170,"But that mind, which is far higher, should be a contradiction-that is not a pity at all. 
 - HoP 3",98.0
14171,"The contradiction is therefore by no means solved by Kant; and since mind takes it upon itself, and contradiction is self-destructive, mind is in itself all derangement and disorder. 
 - HoP 3",192.0
14172,"The true solution would be found in the statement that the categories have no truth in themselves, and the Unconditioned of Reason just as little, but that it lies in the unity of both as concrete, and in that alone. 
 - HoP 3",226.0

 - HoP 3",155.0
14377,"In art it is thus certainly the sensuous mode which gives us the conception of the Idea; reality and ideality are here directly in one. 
 - HoP 3",145.0
14378,"But at this point also Kant says that we must remain at what is one-sided, at the very moment when he is passing out beyond it. 
 - HoP 3",137.0
14379,"The wealth of thought therefore still unfolds itself with Kant in subjective form alone; all fulness, all content, concentrates in conceiving, thinking, postulating. 
 - HoP 3",175.0
14380,"The objective, according to Kant, is only what is in itself; and we know not what Things-in-themselves are. 
 - HoP 3",117.0

 - HoP 3",124.0
14386,"But that this intellectus archetypus  is the true Idea of the understanding, is a thought which does not strike Kant. 
 - HoP 3",127.0
14390,"The highest form in which the conception of the concrete comes into Kants philosophy is this, that the end is grasped in its entire universality; and thus it is the Good. 
 - HoP 3",180.0
14392,"This identity of the Good and reality is the demand of practical Reason; but subjective Reason cannot realize this. 
 - HoP 3",125.0
14393,"In every good action a man no doubt accomplishes something good, but this is only limited; universal Good, as the final object of the world, can be attained to only through a third.

14394,"And this power over the world, which has as its final object the Good in the world, is God. 
 - HoP 3",101.0
14395,"Thus the Critique of the Faculty of Judgment also ends with the postulate of God. 
 - HoP 3",91.0
14396,"Now, although the particular laws of Nature, as independent individual relations, have no relation to the Good, Reason consists in having and desiring unity as the essential or substantial in itself. 
 - HoP 3",209.0
14398,"This is the position which God assumes in Kants philosophy: no proof is possible, he says, of Gods existence, but the demand is there. 
 - HoP 3",144.0
14400,"Thus, therefore, according to Kant , God can only be believed in. 
 - HoP 3",75.0
14401,"We associate the faith of Jacobi with this; for in this point Kant agrees with Jacobi. 
 - HoP 3",96.0
14402,"If now, in accordance with this standpoint of Kant and Jacobi, God is believed in, and we admit this standpoint for an instant, there is certainly a return to the Absolute. 
 - HoP 3",182.0
14403,"But the question remains: What is God? To define Him as supersensuous is not much, nor is it more to say He is universal, abstract, absolute. 
 - HoP 3",151.0
14405,"But here the furthest point reached is the general statement that God exists with the determination of being infinite, universal, indeterminate. 
 - HoP 3",154.0
14406,"God cannot be known in this way; for in order to be known He must as concrete possess at least two determinations. 
 - HoP 3",124.0
14407,"In this way mediation would be established, for a knowledge of the concrete is at once a mediate knowledge. 
 - HoP 3",117.0

 - HoP 3",167.0
14414,"Therefore actuality counts as something sensuous, empirical, for the comprehension of which Kant takes the categories of the Understanding, giving them the same validity as they have in every-day life. 
 - HoP 3",211.0
14415,"This is a complete philosophy of the Understanding, which renounces Reason: the reason why it became so popular was the negative one, that men were once for all free from the old metaphysic. 
 - HoP 3",200.0
14416,"According to Kant something sensuous is produced, having thought-determinations, which, however, is not the thing, for if a man, for instance, feels something hard, Kant says: I feel hardness, but I do not feel Something. 
 - HoP 3",231.0
14417,"Kants philosophy thus ends with a dualism, with the relation which is a plainly essential ought,  with the unreconciled contradiction. 
 - HoP 3",144.0
14418,"It is otherwise with Jacobis faith; he finds the conception of God as immediate existence, and all mediation is untrue for him. 
 - HoP 3",137.0
14419,"With Kant, therefore, the result is: We know only phenomena;  with Jacobi, on the other hand, it is: We know only the finite and conditioned. 
 - HoP 3",151.0
14421,"The further result attending this is the autocracy of the subjective Reason, which, seeing that it is abstract and without knowledge, has only subjective certainty and not objective truth. 
 - HoP 3",198.0
14422,"The second cause of rejoicing was the concession to freedom of a perfect right, which I can neither understand nor justify, and need not do so; my subjective liberty of conviction and certainty holds good all round.

14423,"The third cause of joy was added by Jacobi, who said that it amounted even to a crime to seek to know the truth, because the infinite was thereby only rendered finite.

 - HoP 3",174.0
14428,"The third is the unity of the two; the absolute, self-conscious actuality is the sum of true actuality, into which are re-absorbed both the objective and the independently existent subjective.

 - HoP 3",228.0
14459,"As we mentioned above , the shortcoming in the Kantian philosophy was its unthinking inconsistency, through which speculative unity was lacking to the whole system; and this shortcoming was removed by Fichte. 
 - HoP 3",218.0
14463,"The form in which it is presented has also the disadvantage, and indeed, the real drawback of bringing the empiric ego ever before ones eyes, which is absurd, and quite distracting to ones point of view. 
 - HoP 3",213.0
14464,"The claims of Philosophy have advanced so far that in the first place self-consciousness refuses any longer to regard absolute essence as immediate substance which does not in itself possess difference, reality, and actuality. 
 - HoP 3",236.0
14465,"Against this substance self-consciousness ever struggled, for it does not find its explicit Being there, and consequently feels the lack of freedom. 
 - HoP 3",158.0
14466,"But besides this it demanded that this essence, objectively presented, should be personal, living, self-conscious, actual, and not shut up in abstract metaphysical thoughts alone.

14469,"That whereby it distinguishes itself from the simplicity of thought, and distinguishes this other, is likewise immediately for it; it is identical with, or not distinguished from it.

14470,"Hence it is pure thought, or the ego is the true synthetic judgment a priori, as Kant called it. 
 - HoP 3",106.0
14471,"This principle is apprehended actuality, for the taking back of the other-Being into self-consciousness is just apprehension. 
 - HoP 3",135.0

14474,"Nothing other than the ego anywhere exists, and the ego is there because it is there; what is there is only in the ego and for the ego.

14475,"Now Fichte merely set forth this Notion; he did not bring it to a scientific realization from itself. 
 - HoP 3",111.0
14476,"For to him this Notion maintains and asserts itself as this Notion; it has absoluteness for him in so far as it is merely the unrealized Notion, and thus indeed comes once more into opposition with reality. 
 - HoP 3",216.0
14477,"The Fichtian philosophy has the great advantage of having set forth the fact that Philosophy must be a science derived from one supreme principle, from which all determinations are necessarily derived. 
 - HoP 3",211.0
14478,"The important point is this unity of principle and the attempt to develop from it in a scientifically consistent way the whole content of consciousness, or, as has been said, to construct the whole world. 
 - HoP 3",214.0
14479,"Beyond this no progress was made.

 - HoP 3",152.0
14481,"Thus Fichte does not, like Kant, throw his work into narrative form because he begins with the ego; but he has proceeded further, inasmuch as he sought to bring about a construction of determinations of knowledge from the ego. 
 - HoP 3",236.0
14483,"Thus as Kant treats of cognition Erkennen, so Fichte sets forth real knowledge Wissen. 
 - HoP 3",96.0
14484,"Fichte states that the task of Philosophy is to find a theory of knowledge; universal knowledge is both the object and the starting-point of Philosophy.

14485,"Consciousness knows, that is its nature; the end of philosophic learning is the knowledge of this knowledge. 
 - HoP 3",118.0
14486,"Hence Fichte called his philosophy the Theory of Knowledge , the science of knowledge. 
 - HoP 3",96.0
14488,"But when I philosophize, I make my ordinary consciousness itself my object, because I make a pure category my consciousness: I know what my ego is doing, and thus I get behind my ordinary consciousness.

14492,"As proposition, as principle, the ego must not remain barren, nor be accepted as one, for to a proposition pertains a synthesis. 
 - HoP 3",138.0
14493,"Now Fichte proceeds in his system from the fact that Philosophy must begin with an absolutely unconditioned, certain principle, with something indubitably certain in ordinary knowledge. 
 - HoP 3",195.0
14494,"It cannot be proved or defined, because it must be absolutely the first principle. 
 - HoP 3",92.0
14497,"It must have a principle which can neither be proved from it nor from another science; for it is supreme. 
 - HoP 3",115.0
14498,"If there is a theory of knowledge there also is a system; if there is a system there is also a theory of knowledge and an absolute first principle-and so on through an inevitable circle. 
 - HoP 3",196.0
14499,"The simple principle of this knowledge is certainty of myself, which is the relation of me to myself; what is in me, that I know. 
 - HoP 3",139.0
14500,"The supreme principle, as immediate and not derived, must be certain on its own account; that is, a determination of the ego only, for it is only from the ego that I cannot abstract. 
 - HoP 3",192.0
14501,"Fichte thus begins, like Descartes, with I think, therefore I am, and he expressly brings this proposition to mind. 
 - HoP 3",125.0
14502,"The Being of the ego is not a dead, but a concrete Being; but the highest Being is thought. 
 - HoP 3",101.0
14503,"Ego, as an explicitly self-existent activity of thought, is thus knowledge, even if it is only abstract knowledge, as in the beginning at least it cannot help being. 
 - HoP 3",175.0
14504,"At the same time Fichte begins from this absolute certainty with quite other necessities and demands; for from this ego not only Being but also the larger system of thought has to be derived. 
 - HoP 3",201.0
14505,"According to Fichte, the ego is the source of the categories and ideas, but all conceptions and thoughts are a manifold reduced to a synthesis through Thought. 
 - HoP 3",169.0
14508,"The ego is certain, it cannot be doubted; but Philosophy desires to reach the truth. 
 - HoP 3",94.0
14509,"The certainty is subjective, and because it is made to remain the basis, all else remains subjective also without there being any possibility of this form being removed. 
 - HoP 3",179.0
14510,"Fichte now analyzes the ego, reducing it to three principles from which the whole of knowledge has to be evolved. 
 - HoP 3",123.0
14512,"The first principle must thus be identical. 
 - HoP 3",53.0
14514,"It signifies A = A, the abstract undetermined identity; that is the proposition of contradiction, wherein A is an indifferent content. 
 - HoP 3",144.0
14515,"Fichte says, Thought is by no means essence, but only a particular determination of Being; there are outside of it many other determinations of our Being. 
 - HoP 3",164.0
14516,"I merely remark this, that when I am is overstepped, Spinozism is necessarily reached. 
 - HoP 3",96.0
14517,"Its unity is something which ought to be produced through us, but which cannot be so; it is not anything that is. 
 - HoP 3",123.0
14518,"The first proposition is then that I am identical with myself, Ego = Ego;384 that undoubtedly is the definition of the ego. 
 - HoP 3",133.0
14519,"The subject and the predicate are the content; and this content of the two sides is likewise their relation, ie form. 
 - HoP 3",127.0
14520,"Relation requires two sides; the relating and the related are here, however, the same; for on account of the simplicity of the ego, there is nothing but a relation of the ego to the ego. 
 - HoP 3",196.0
14521,"I have knowledge of myself; but in so far as I am consciousness, I know of an object which is different from me, and which is then likewise mine. 
 - HoP 3",155.0
14522,"But the ego is in such a way identical with its difference that what is different is immediately the same, and what is identical is likewise different; we have a difference without a difference. 
 - HoP 3",204.0
14523,"Self-consciousness is not dead identity, or non-Being, but the object which is identical with me. 
 - HoP 3",107.0
14524,"This is immediately certain; all else must be as certain to me, inasmuch as it must be my relation to myself. 
 - HoP 3",119.0
14525,"The content must be transformed into the ego, so that in it I have my determination alone. 
 - HoP 3",100.0
14530,"This second principle, set forth under the first, is, I assert a non-ego in opposition to the ego,  and in this something other than absolute self-consciousness is set forth. 
 - HoP 3",184.0
14531,"To this pertains the form therein present, relation; but the content is the non-ego, another content from the ego. 
 - HoP 3",124.0
14533,"Here, then, we have no more to do with derivation, although this derivation of opposition from the first proposition was all the same demanded. 
 - HoP 3",153.0
14534,"Inasmuch as I posit another in opposition to the ego, I posit myself as not posited; this non-ego is the object generally, ie that which is opposed to me. 
 - HoP 3",164.0
14535,"This other is the negative of the ego; thus when Fichte called it the non-ego he was expressing himself in a very happy, suitable, and consistent manner. 
 - HoP 3",163.0
14536,"There has been a good deal of ridicule cast on the ego and non-ego; the expression is new, and therefore to us Germans it seems strange at first. 
 - HoP 3",155.0
14537,"But the French say Moi and Non-moi, without finding anything laughable in it. 
 - HoP 3",87.0
14538,"In this principle the positing belongs, however, to the ego; but because the non-ego is independent of the ego, we have two sides, and self-consciousness relates itself to another. 
 - HoP 3",190.0
14539,"This second proposition thus signifies that I posit myself as limited, as non-ego; but non-ego is something quite new to be added. 
 - HoP 3",140.0
14540,"On the one side we thus have before us a field which is merely appropriated from the ego; and in this way we have before us the non-ego as our object. 
 - HoP 3",160.0
14542,"This third proposition is the determination of the first two through one another, in such a way that the ego limits the non-ego. 
 - HoP 3",138.0
14543,"In and through the ego both the ego and the non-ego are posited as capable of being mutually limited by means of one another, ie in such a way that the reality of the one abrogates the reality of the other. 
 - HoP 3",216.0
14544,"In limitation both are negated, but only in part ; only thus are synthesis and deduction possible. 
 - HoP 3",108.0
14545,"I posit the non-ego, which is for me, in myself, in my identity with myself; thus I take it from its non-identity, its not-being-I, that is to say I limit it. 
 - HoP 3",168.0
14546,"This limitation of the non-ego Fichte expresses thus: I place in opposition to the ego,  and indeed to the divisible ego, a divisible non-ego. 
 - HoP 3",152.0
14547,"The non-ego I destroy as a complete sphere, which it was according to the second principle, and posit it as divisible; I likewise posit the ego as divisible in so far as the non-ego is present in it. 
 - HoP 3",209.0
14548,"The whole sphere which I have before me is supposed indeed to be the ego, but in it I have not one but two. 
 - HoP 3",117.0
14549,"The proposition of ground is thus the relation of reality and negation, ie it is limitation; it contains the ego limited by the non-ego, and the non-ego limited by the ego. 
 - HoP 3",182.0
14550,"Of this synthesis there is nothing, properly speaking, contained in the two earlier propositions. 
 - HoP 3",107.0
14551,"Even this first presentation of the three principles does away with the immanence of real knowledge. 
 - HoP 3",110.0
14552,"Thus the presentation is here also subject to an opposite from the first, as it is with Kant, even if these are two acts of the ego merely, and we remain entirely in the ego. 
 - HoP 3",184.0
14553,"Now that limitation may take place for me in two different ways: at one time the one is passive, at another time the other is so. 
 - HoP 3",139.0
14555,"Or, on the other hand, the ego, as abrogating other-being, is that which limits, and non-ego is the limited. 
 - HoP 3",118.0
14556,"I know myself then as clearly determining the non-ego, as the absolute cause of the non-ego as such, for I can think. 
 - HoP 3",127.0
14557,"The first is the proposition of the theoretic reason, of intelligence: the second the proposition of practical reason, of will. 
 - HoP 3",137.0
14558,"The will is this, that I am conscious of myself as limiting the object; thus I make myself exercise activity upon the object and maintain myself. 
 - HoP 3",155.0
14559,"The theoretic proposition is that the object is before me and it determines me. 
 - HoP 3",89.0
14560,"The ego is, since I perceive, a content, and I have this content in me, which is thus outside of me. 
 - HoP 3",110.0
14561,"This is on the whole the same thing as we meet with in the experience of Kant: it comes to the same thing whether it is by matter or the non-ego that the ego is here determined. 
 - HoP 3",187.0
14562,"In the theoretic consciousness the ego, although the assertive generally, finds itself limited by the non-ego. 
 - HoP 3",120.0
14563,"But it is identical with itself; hence its infinite activity ever sets itself to abrogate the non-ego and to bring forth itself. 
 - HoP 3",138.0
14564,"Now the different methods whereby the ego sets forth itself are the different methods of its activity; these we have to understand in their necessity. 
 - HoP 3",160.0
14565,"But since philosophic knowledge is the consideration of consciousness itself , I can only know knowledge, the act of the ego. 
 - HoP 3",135.0
14568,"Thus, when I see a large square object, such as a wall, my ordinary consciousness accepts these determinations as they are given to it; the object is. 
 - HoP 3",160.0
14569,"In so doing I do not think of seeing, but of the object; seeing, however, is my activity, the determinations of my faculty of sensation are thus posited through me. 
 - HoP 3",174.0
14570,"The ego as theoretic is, indeed, aware in philosophic consciousness that it is the ego which posits; but here it posits that the non-ego posits somewhat in me. 
 - HoP 3",169.0
14571,"The ego thus posits itself as that which is limited by the non-ego. 
 - HoP 3",77.0
14572,"I make this limitation mine; thus is it for me in me, this passivity of the ego is itself the activity of the ego. 
 - HoP 3",124.0
14573,"As a matter of fact, all reality which appears in the object for the ego is a determination of the ego,389 just as the categories and other determinations were in Kants case. 
 - HoP 3",184.0
14574,"Thus it is here more especially that we should expect Fichte to demonstrate the return of other-Being into absolute consciousness. 
 - HoP 3",140.0
14575,"However, because after all the other-Being was regarded as unconditioned, as implicit, this return does not come to pass. 
 - HoP 3",131.0
14576,"The ego determines the other, indeed, but this unity is an altogether finite unity; non-ego has thus immediately escaped from determination once more and gone forth from this unity. 
 - HoP 3",191.0
14577,"What we find is merely an alternation between self-consciousness and the consciousness of another, and the constant progression of this alternation, which never reaches any end. 
 - HoP 3",187.0
14578,"These particular thought-determinations he calls categories, and he seeks to demonstrate them in their necessity; from the time of Aristotle onwards no one had thought of so doing. 
 - HoP 3",190.0
14580,"In the second place, Causality is the same degree of activity in the one as of passivity in the other. 
 - HoP 3",112.0
14584,"The ego is so far the ideal ground of all conceptions of the object; all determination of this object is a determination of the ego. 
 - HoP 3",142.0
14585,"But in order that it may be object, it must be placed in opposition to the ego, ie the determinations set forth through the ego are another, the non-ego; this placing of the object in opposition is the real ground of conceptions. 
 - HoP 3",239.0

14960,"The first potency is that the first quantitative difference of the Absolute, or the first relative totality is matter.

14961,"Proof: A = B is not anything real either as relative identity or as relative duplicity.

14962,"As identity A = B, in the individual as in the whole, can be expressed only by the line, -the first dimension. 
 - HoP 3",120.0
14963,"But in that line A is posited throughout as existent,  ie it is at the same time related to B.

 - HoP 3",75.0
14966,"Relative identity and duplicity are contained in relative totality, not indeed actu, but yet potentia.

14967,"Therefore the two opposites must mutually extinguish each other in a third  dimension. 
 - HoP 3",96.0
14968,"Absolute identity as the immediate basis of the reality of A and B in matter, is the force of gravitation.

 - HoP 3",122.0
14973,"The same identity, posited under the form of relative identity,  ie of the polarity which we find appearing in A and B, is the force of cohesion. 
 - HoP 3",155.0

15027,"The other assertion is: Form passes into existence by the finite being received into the infinite, difference into indifference.

15029,"Otherwise expressed, the particular becomes absolute form by the universal becoming one with it, and the universal becomes absolute existence by the particular becoming one with it.

15033,"Of the first absolute transformation there are copies in phenomenal Nature; therefore Nature, regarded in itself, is nothing else than that first transformation as it exists in the absolute. 
 - HoP 3",200.0
15035,"But that which may be described thus, namely as existence, in so far as that is mere ground of reality, and therefore has really passed into form, although form has not in turn passed into it, is what presents itself as Nature.

15039,"The passing of absolute form into existence is what we think of as God, and the images or copies of this transformation are in the ideal world, which is therefore in its implicitude the other unity. 
 - HoP 3",208.0
15041,"The ground or basis, Nature as basis merely, is matter, gravity, as the first potency; this passing of form into existence is in the actual world universal mechanism, necessity.

15053,"For in one of his writings, directed on some particular occasion against Jacobi, Schelling explains himself further with regard to the nature of God and His relation to Nature. 
 - HoP 3",186.0
15054,"He says: God, or more properly the existence which is God, is ground: He is ground of Himself as a moral Being.

15063,"The system is the latest form of Philosophy which we had to consider, and it is a form both interesting and true. 
 - HoP 3",123.0
15064,"In the first place special emphasis, in dealing with Schelling, must be laid on the idea that he has grasped the true as the concrete, as the unity of subjective and objective. 
 - HoP 3",186.0
15065,"The main point in Schellings philosophy thus is that its interest centres round that deep, speculative content, which, as content, is the content with which Philosophy in the entire course of its history has had to do. 
 - HoP 3",228.0
15066,"The Thought which is free and independent, not abstract, but in itself concrete, comprehends itself in itself as an intellectually actual world; and this is the truth of Nature, Nature in itself. 
 - HoP 3",205.0
15067,"The second great merit possessed by Schelling is to have pointed out in Nature the forms of Spirit; thus electricity, magnetism, &c, are for him only external modes of the Idea. 
 - HoP 3",187.0
15068,"His defect is that this Idea in general, its distinction into the ideal and the natural world, and also the totality of these determinations, are not shown forth and developed as necessitated in themselves by the Notion. 
 - HoP 3",230.0
15069,"As Schelling has not risen to this point of view, he has misconceived the nature of thought; the work of art thus becomes for him the supreme and only mode in which the Idea exists for spirit. 
 - HoP 3",202.0
15070,"But the supreme mode of the Idea is really its own element; thought, the Idea apprehended, is therefore higher than the work of art. 
 - HoP 3",142.0
15071,"The Idea is the truth, and all that is true is the Idea; the systematizing of the Idea into the world must be proved to be a necessary unveiling and revelation. 
 - HoP 3",170.0
15072,"With Schelling, on the other hand, form is really an external scheme, and his method is the artificial application of this scheme to external objects. 
 - HoP 3",160.0
15074,"These forms were potencies with Schelling, but instead of mathematical forms or a type of thought like this, by some other men sensuous forms have been taken as basis, just as were sulphur and mercury by Jacob Boehme. 
 - HoP 3",227.0
15075,"For instance, magnetism, electricity, and chemistry have been defined to be the three potencies in Nature, and thus in the organism reproduction has been termed chemistry; irritability, electricity; and sensibility, magnetism. 
 - HoP 3",236.0
15076,"In this way there has crept into Natural Philosophy the great formalism of representing everything as a series, which is a superficial determination without necessity, since instead of Notions we find formulas.

15077,"Brilliant powers of imagination are displayed, such as were exhibited by GÃ¶rres. 
 - HoP 3",91.0
15079,"Philosophy would in this way become a play of mere analogical reflections; and it is not with these but with thoughts that we have to do.

15087,"The philosophy of Locke is not so crude as it is, for it is not a whit better in either its content or its form, and it is combined with foolish self-conceit into the bargain.

15088,"Philosophy on this account sank into general and well-deserved contempt, such as is for the most part extended to those who assert that they have a monopoly of philosophy. 
 - HoP 3",181.0
15090,"Five-and-twenty years ago436 the case was the same with poetic art; a taste for ingenious conceits took possession of it, and the effusions of its poetic inspiration came forth blindly from itself, shot out as from a pistol.

15091,"The results were either crazy ravings, or, if they were not ravings, they were prose so dull that it was unworthy of the name of prose.

 - HoP 3",162.0
15106,"To this point the World-spirit has come, and each stage has its own form in the true system of Philosophy; nothing is lost, all principles are preserved, since Philosophy in its final aspect is the totality of forms. 
 - HoP 3",226.0
15107,"This concrete idea is the result of the strivings of spirit during almost twenty-five centuries of earnest work to become objective to itself, to know itself:    TantÃ¦ molis erat, se ipsam cognoscere mentem. 
 - HoP 3",218.0
15108,"All this time was required to produce the philosophy of our day; so tardily and slowly did the World-spirit work to reach this goal.

15114,"This work of the spirit to know itself, this activity to find itself, is the life of the spirit and the spirit itself. 
 - HoP 3",128.0
15115,"Its result is the Notion which it takes up of itself; the history of Philosophy is a revelation of what has been the aim of spirit throughout its history; it is therefore the worlds history in its innermost signification. 
 - HoP 3",231.0
15116,"This work of the human spirit in the recesses of thought is parallel with all the stages of reality; and therefore no philosophy oversteps its own time.

15117,"The importance which the determinations of thought possessed is another matter, which does not belong to the history of Philosophy.

15118,"These Notions are the simplest revelation of the World spirit: in their more concrete form they are history.

15124,"In the third place we do not find here feeble little efforts to establish or to criticize this or that particular point; instead of that, each philosophy sets up a new principle of its own, and this must be recognized. 
 - HoP 3",228.0
15126,"The philosophy of the ancients had the absolute Idea as its thought; and the realization or reality of the same consisted in comprehending the existing present world, and regarding it as it is in its absolute nature.

 - HoP 3",165.0
15130,"The Notion as subject, its independence, its inwardness, abstract separation, is represented by the Stoics, Epicureans and Sceptics: here we have not the free, concrete form, but universality abstract and in itself formal.

15131,"The thought of totality, the intelligible world, is the concrete Idea as we have seen it with the Neo-Platonists.

15136,"The work of the spirit now consisted in bringing this Beyond back to reality, and guiding it into self-consciousness.

15142,"In the second place, self-consciousness thinks of itself as being self-consciousness; in being self-conscious it is independent, but still in this independence it has a negative relation to what is outside self-consciousness.
