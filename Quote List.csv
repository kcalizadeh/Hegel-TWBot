3,Logic did not fare quite so badly as metaphysics,48
4,Even the proofs of the existence of god are cited only for historical interest or for purposes of edification and uplifting the emotions,136
5,The fact is that there no longer exists any interest either in the form or the content of metaphysics or in both together,121
6,[kantian philosophy] was a justification from a philosophical quarter for the renunciation of speculative thought,113
7,There was seen the strange spectacle of a cultured nation without metaphysics−like a temple richly ornamented but without a holy of holies.,139
8,"Outer existence seemed to be transformed into the bright world of flowers−and there are no black flowers, as we know",116
9,The spirit of practicality certainly did not intend for logic a better fate than was suffered by the sister science,115
10,That one learns from logic how to think − just as if one could only learn how to digest and move about by studying anatomy and physiology,137
11,Logic shows no traces so far of the new spirit,46
12,"Once the form of the spirit has inwardly reconstituted itself, all attempts to preserve the forms of an earlier culture are utterly in vain",139
13,Like withered leaves they are pushed off by the new buds already growing at their roots,87
14,The only way they can give a positive significance and a content to their negative attitude is to fall in with the new ways of thinking,135
15,The period of fermentation with which a new creative idea begins is past,72
16,It is fearful of losing itself in the ramifications of the particular,69
17,"It shuns the labour required for a scientific elaboration of the new principle and in its need for such, it grasps at an empty formalism",136
18,The challenge to elaborate and systematise the material now becomes all the more pressing,89
19,The higher demand is that it should become systematised knowledge,65
20,"The science of logic which constitutes metaphysics proper or purely speculative philosophy, has hitherto still been much neglected",130
21,What is involved is an altogether new concept of scientific procedure,69
22,"Philosophy, if it would be a science, cannot, as i have remarked elsewhere, borrow its method from subordinate sciences like mathematics",136
23,"[philosophy cannot] remain satisfied with categorical assurances of inner intuition, or employ arguments based on external reflection",133
24,It can be only the nature of the content itself which spontaneously develops itself in a scientific method of knowing,117
25,Since it is at the same time the reflection of the content itself which first posits and generates its determinate character,124
26,"The understanding determines, and holds the determinations fixed",64
27,"Reason is negative and dialectical, because it resolves the determinations of the understanding into nothing",108
28,[reason] is positive because it generates the universal and comprehends the particular therein,94
29,Just as the understanding is usually taken to be something separate from reason as such,87
30,So too dialectical reason is usually taken to be something distinct from positive reason,88
31,"But reason in its truth is spirit which is higher than either merely positive reason, or merely intuitive understanding",119
32,"It is the negative, that which constitutes the quality alike of dialectical reason and of understanding",103
33,"It negates what is simple, thus positing the specific difference of the understanding; it equally resolves it and is thus dialectical",133
34,But it does not stay in the nothing of this result but in the result is no less positive - in this way it has restored what was simple,134
35,But as a universal which is within itself concrete,50
36,A given particular is not subsumed under this universal ,56
37,"But in this determining, this positing of a difference, and the resolving of it, the particular has already determined itself",125
38,This movement is the absolute method of knowing and at the same time is the immanent soul of the content itself,111
39,"I maintain that it is this self−construing method alone which enables philosophy to be an objective, demonstrated science",121
40,Consciousness is spirit as a concrete knowing,45
41,But the development of this object rests solely on the nature of the pure essentialities which constitute the content of logic,126
42,"But the development of this object, like the development of all natural and spiritual life,",91
43,"Consciousness, as spirit in its manifestation which in its progress frees itself from its immediacy and external concretion",123
44,"They are pure thoughts, spirit thinking its own essential nature",64
45,Their self−movement is their spiritual life and is that through which philosophy constitutes itself and of which it is the exposition,133
46,"To exhibit the realm of thought philosophically, that is, in its own immanent activity or what is the same, in its necessary development",136
47,"The forms of thought are, in the first instance, displayed and stored as human language",87
48,Nowadays we cannot be too often reminded that it is thinking which distinguishes man from the beasts,100
49,"Everything that he expresses in language contains a category−concealed, mixed with other forms or clearly determined as such, ",126
50,"So much is logic his natural element, indeed his own peculiar nature",68
51, logic must certainly be said to be the supernatural element which permeates every relationship of man to nature,112
52,"If nature as such, as the physical, is contrasted with the spiritual sphere, then logic must certainly be said to be th supernatural element",140
53,It is an advantage when a language possesses an abundance of logical expressions,80
54,Many prepositions and articles denote relationships based on thought,68
55,It is important that in language the categories should appear in the form of substantives and verbs and thus take on the form of objectivity,140
56,To find the union of opposites naively shown in the dictionary as one word with opposite meanings,97
57,This result of speculative thinking is nonsensical to the understanding,71
58,Philosophy therefore stands in no need of a special terminology,63
59,"The advance of culture generally, and of the sciences in particular, gradually brings into use higher relationships of thought",126
60,"The empirical and natural sciences, which in general employ the commonest categories: whole and parts, a thing and its properties, and such",139
61,"In physics, for example, the category of force has become predominant",69
62," the form of abstraction, of identity, by which a specific concept, as, for example, force, acquires an independent self−subsistence",132
63,The category of polarity which is the determination of a difference in which the different terms are inseparably conjoined,122
64,"Prominence has been given to the determinate form, the difference, which is at the same time an inseparable element in the identity",131
65,Because of the fixed reality of natural objects the study of nature compels us to fix the categories  which can no longer be ignored in her,139
66,Indulging in generalities as so easily happens in the intellectual sphere.,74
67,"[logic] may be thoroughly familiar to educated people it does not follow, as i have said, that they are intelligently apprehended",129
68,"Just those determinations of thought which we employ on every occasion, which pass our lips in every sentence we speak",118
69,To have to occupy oneself with what is familiar can even arouse impatience,74
70,The kind of preliminary general idea which is demanded in the case of any science prior to its exposition,105
71,There is no human desiring or willing without ideation,54
72,The forms of thought have been freed from the material in which they are submerged,82
73,These universalities have been brought into prominence for their own sake and made objects of contemplation,107
74,"As a matter of fact, the need to occupy oneself with pure thought presupposes that the human spirit must already have travelled a long road",139
75,"In the silent regions of thought which has come to itself and communes only with itself,",88
76,The interests which move the lives of races and individuals are hushed,70
77,"In the silent regions of thought which has come to itself, ... the interests which move the lives of races and individuals are hushed",133
78,"This science, which is not studied for its utility, is the only absolutely free science and so seems to be a more than human possession",135
79,Logic is concerned only and solely with these thoughts as thoughts,66
80,"For this reason it is customary, to include logic in the curriculum of youth",76
81, the study of logic is a preliminary labour to be carried out in school and it is not until later that the serious business of life begins ,139
82,"In life, the categories are used;",33
83,"In the conception of god or of love there is epitomised in the simplicity of such ideating an infinite host of ideas actions states, etc!",137
84,"Secondly, the categories serve for the more exact determination and discovery of objective relations",100
85,"When in philo. reflection the categories are made to serve as means, then thinking is treated as subordinate to the other activities of mind",140
86,"We do not indeed say of our feelings, impulses or interests that they serve us",78
87,"Rather do they count as independent forces and powers, so that to have this particular feeling, to desire this, is what we are",126
88,"But probably we are more conscious of obeying our feelings passions, interests, not to mention habits, than of having them in our possession",140
89,"Still less, in view of our intimate union with them, of their being at our disposal",83
90,Universality which we are conscious ourselves of being,54
91,We are disposed to regard ourselves as caught up in these particular states and dominated by them,97
92,It is much more difficult to believe that the forms of thought which permeate all our ideas are tools for us rather than that we serve them,139
93,"When we give ourselves up to a sensation, a purpose, an interest, and in it feel ourselves confined and unfree,",111
94,"The place into which we can withdraw ourselves back into freedom is this region of self−certainty, of pure abstraction, of thought",130
95,"We call the nature or the essence of things their notion, and this is only for thought;",87
96,Still less shall we say of the notions of things that we dominate them,70
97," on the contrary, it is our thinking that must accommodate itself to them and our freedom ought not to want to mold them to suit itself",135
98,"Subjective thought is our very own, innermost, act",50
99,The objective notion of things constitutes their essential import,65
100,"We cannot go outside this our act, we cannot stand above it, and just as little can we go beyond the nature of things",117
101,For us the object can be nothing else but our notions of it,59
102,It is absurd to say that the object would be set up as criterion for our notion while for us the object can be nothing but our notion of it,139
103," these very things which are supposed to stand beyond us, and  beyond the thoughts referring to them, are  figments of subjective thought",137
104,The so−called thing−in−itself of empty abstraction.,51
105,"What we consciously attend to is the contents, the objects of our ideas, that in which we are interested",104
106,"What is genuinely permanent & substantial in the complexity & contingency of appearance & fleeting manifestation, is the notion of the thing",140
107,Each individual animal is such individual primarily because it is an animal:,76
108,"If this is true, then it would be impossible to say what such an individual could still be if this foundation were removed",122
109,"The profounder basis is the soul itself, the pure notion which is the very heart of things, the simple life−pulse, even of thinking of them",139
110,"To focus attention on this logical nature which animates mind, moves and works in it, this is the task",102
111,The content of the interest in which one is absorbed is drawn out of immediate unity with oneself & becomes an independent object of thought,140
112,"Whereas when thinking is an instinctive activity, spirit is encaged in its categories and is broken up into an infinitely varied material",137
113,The most important point for the nature of spirit is ... the relation of what it knows itself to be to what it actually is,122
114,"Because spirit is essentially consciousness, this self−knowing is a fundamental determination of its actuality",110
115,As impulses the categories are only instinctively active.,57
116,At first they enter consciousness separately and so are variable and mutually confusing;,88
117,"The determinations of thought, primarily as forms which are distinct from the matter of thought and only attached to it",119
118,The loftier business of logic therefore is to clarify these categories and in them to raise mind to freedom and truth,117
119,"In whatever respect the true may be associated with limitation and finitude this is the aspect of its negation, of its untruth and unreality",140
120,It is in bondage to unclarified and therefore unfree thinking,61
121,"Generally speaking they concern only the correctness of the knowledge of facts, not truth itself.",97
122,Including in our conception of thought not only that which is usually reckoned as belonging to the external form but the content as well. ,138
123,"What at first to ordinary reflection is, as content, divorced from form, cannot in fact be formless, cannot be devoid of inner determination",140
124,The content in its own self possesses form,42
125,It is form itself which is transformed only into the semblance of a content,75
126,"It is form itself which is transformed into only the semblance of a content, hence into a semblance of something external to this semblance",139
127,"The subject matter is not things but their import, the notion of them",69
128,"Secondly, a notion is determinate and it is this determinateness in it which appears as content",95
129,"In any case, any demand for a systematic disposal of such random reflections could only be partially satisfied",110
130,"A plastic discourse demands, too, a plastic receptivity and understanding on the part of the listener;",102
131,The uncouth and uneducated behaviour of taking a category which is under consideration for something other than the category itself,131
132,"Thoroughness seems to require that the beginning, as the foundation on which everything is built, should be examined before anything else,",138
133,"It has before it, enclosed in this germ, the entire development",63
134,This education and discipline of thinking by which it acquires plasticity and by which the impatience of casual reflection is overcome,134
135,"In no science is the need to begin with the subject itself, without preliminary reflections, felt more strongly than in the science of logic",140
136,These abstract matters have ceased to be flesh - hegel,54
137,If we go on to cast a look at the fate of world historical personalities… we shall find it to have been no happy one,116
138,When their object is attained they fall off like empty hulls from the kernel,76
139,"The state of one’s mind ie the phase of mind which one so far possesses, conforms precisely to the state of the world as one so far views it",140
140,History is not the soil of happiness. the periods of happiness are blank pages in it.,85
141,In this educational progress we can see the history of the world’s culture delineated in faint outline,102
142,To make abstractions hold in reality is to destroy reality - hegel,66
143,Life is essentially the concept which realizes itself only through self-division and reunification,98
144,A building is not finished when its foundation is laid - hegel,62
145,The plant brings forth its light as its own self in the blossom. - hegel,72
146, free speech is assured by the innocuous character which it acquires as a result of the stability of government - hegel,119
147,To be independent of public opinion is the first formal condition of achieving anything great or rational - hegel,113
148,"Public opinion has common sense, but is infected by accidents of opinion, ignorance and perversity - hegel",106
149,Necessity appears to itself in the shape of freedom - hegel,59
150,It is the art of music which conducts us to the final summit of that ascent to freedom - hegel,94
151,"The tool lasts, while the immediate enjoyments pass away and are forgotten.",75
152,No act of revenge is justified. - hegel,39
153,"By the act of reflection something is altered in the way in which the fact was originally presented in sensation, perception, or conception",139
154,The man who wonders at nothing lives in a state of imbecility and stupidity.,76
155,"The fact is, no man can think for another, any more than he can eat or drink for him",84
156,Existence as determinate being is in essence being for another.,63
157,"Amid the pressure of great events, a general principle gives no help. - hegel",77
158,"To him who looks upon the world rationally, the world in its turn presents a rational aspect. the relation is mutual. - hegel",125
159,"You cannot save people, only love them - anaïs nin",50
160,World history is a court of judgment - hegel,44
161,Hell is truth seen too late - hobbes,36
162,"A hand e.g. when hewn off from the body is, as aristotle has observed, a hand in name only, not in fact - hegel",111
163,Reason is as cunning as it is powerful,38
164,"Logic on the contrary, cannot presuppose any of these forms of reflection and laws of thinking, for these constitute part of its own content",140
165,"What logic is cannot be stated beforehand, rather this knowledge of what it is first emergea as the final outcome of the whole exposition",137
166,The notion of logic has its genesis in the course of exposition and cannot therefore be premised,96
167,"But in the first place, it is quite inept to say that logic abstracts from all content",86
168,"As thinking and the rules of thinking are supposed to be the subject matter of logic, these directly constitute its peculiar content;",133
169,"Hitherto, the notion of logic has rested on the separation, ... of the content of cognition and its form, or of truth and certainty",131
170,"The object is regarded as something complete on its own account, something which can wholly dispense with thought for its actuality",131
171,It based itself on the fact that the knowledge of things obtained through thinking is alone what is really true in them,119
172,"Thus this metaphysic believed that thinking (and its determinations) is not anything alien to the object, but rather is its essential nature",140
173,"In this self−renunciation on the part of reason, the notion of truth is lost;",77
174,The insight into the necessary conflict of the determinations of the understanding with themselves.,99
175,But equally it must transcend these its separating determinations and straightway connect them,94
176,It is at the stage of this connecting of the determinations that their conflict emerges.,88
177,This connecting activity of reflection belongs in itself to reason,66
178,"The rising above determinations, which attains an insight into their conflict, is the great negativestep towards the true notion of reason",138
179,"The insight, when not thorough−going, commits the mistake of thinking that it is reason which is in contradiction with itself;",126
180,It does not recognise that the contradiction is precisely the rising of reason above the limits of the understanding & the resolving of them,140
181,"[kant] attributes to us a correct perception, with the rider that nevertheless we cannot percieve what is true but only what is false",133
182,Determinations of finite & infinite conflict in the same way whether they are applied to to the world or are determinations within the mind,139
183,"Absurd as this would be, it would not be more so than a true knowledge which did not know the object as it is in itself.",120
184,The forms of objective thinking are removed by this critique only from the thing; they are left in the subject just as they were originally,139
185,This abstract shadow divorced from all content - hegel,54
186,"But this attempt, because it proceeded from a subjective standpoint, could not be brought to a successful conclusion",116
187,The insubstantial nature of logical forms originates solely in the way in which they are considered and dealt with,114
188,The content which is missing in the logical forms is nothing else than a solid foundation and a concretion of these abstract determinations;,140
189,If logic is supposed to lack a substantial content the fault is not with its subject matter but with the way in which this matter is grasped,140
190," [logic] cannot be justified in any other way than by this emergence in consciousness, all the forms of which are resolved into this notion",139
191,A definition of science−or more precisely of logic−has its proof solely in the already mentioned necessity of its emergence in consciousness,140
192,"Argumentation is open to the most manifold and various opinions, on which a decision can finally be determined only arbitrarily",127
193,It is only in absolute knowing that separation of the object from the certainty of itself is completely eliminated,114
194,Thus pure science presupposes liberation from the opposition of consciousness.,78
195,"Logic is to be understood as the system of pure reason, as the realm of pure thought",84
196,One must discard the prejudice that truth must be something tangible.,69
197,Only in its notion does a thing possess actuality; to the extent that it is distinct from its notion it ceases to be actual & is a nonentity,140
198, now if logic has not undergone any change since aristotle ... then surely ... it is all the more in need of a total reconstruction; ,133
199,"The addition of psychological, pedagogic & physiological material which logic received in the past has now been recognised as disfigurement",139
200,The method is the consciousness of the form of the inner self−movement of the content of logic,94
201,The negative is just as much positive - hegel,45
202,"What is self−contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, ... but essentially only into the negation of its particular content",135
203,The result essentially contains that from which it results;,59
204,"Because the result, the negation, is a specific negation, it has content",72
205,"[the result of negation] is richer by the negation or opposite of its predecessor, therefore contains it, but also something more",129
206,The method which i follow in this system of logic −− or rather which this system in its own self follows −−,107
207,That which enables the notion to advance itself is the already mentioned negative which it possesses within itself,114
208,"If no advance is made beyond the abstract negative aspect of dialectic, the result is only that reason is incapable of knowing the infinite",139
209,It is only after profounder acquaintance with the other sciences that logic ceases to be for subjective spirit a merely abstract universal,138
210,The value of logic is only apprehended when it is preceded by experience of the sciences - hegel,96
211,"The system of logic is the realm of shadows, the world of simple essentialities freed from all sensuous concreteness",116
212,"In the philosophical treatment of classification, the notion itself must show that it is itself the course of those determinations. ",132
213,"In [logic] the opposition in consciousness between a subject, and a second an object, is known to be overcome; ",111
214,"Because they are at the same time known as distinct (yet not with an independent being), their unity is not abstract and inert, but concrete",140
215,"We must not understand the judgment as a resolving of a concrete unity back into its determinations, as if these had independent subsistence",140
216,It is easy to perceive that such an abstraction as the thing−in−itself is itself only a product of thought,106
217,"An object is a thought, and to determine it means partly, first to produce it, and partly, to have further thoughts about it",124
218,It is first and immediately ontology whose place is taken by objective logic,76
219,The subjective logic is the logic of the ... the subject itself,63
220,"What philosophy begins with must be either mediated or immediate, & it can be neither one nor the other; either way of beginning is refuted",139
221,In this science of manifested spirit the beginning is made from empirical consciousness - this is immediate knowledge in the strict sense,137
222,"Logic is pure science, that is, pure knowledge in the entire range of its development",85
223,"Thus the principle ought also to be the beginning, and what is the first for thought ought also to be the first in the process of thinking.",139
224,"There is nothing, nothing in heaven, or in nature or in mind or anywhere else which does not equally contain both immediacy and mediation",137
225,[mediation and immediacy] reveal themselves to be unseparated and inseparable and the opposition between them to be a nullity,125
226,All that is needed to ensure that the beginning remains immanent in its scientific development is simply to take up what is there before us.,140
227,"Pure knowing is without any distinction & as thus distinctionless, ceases itself to be knowledge; what is present is only simple immediacy",138
228,"This simple immediacy, therefore, in its true expression is pure being",70
229,"If no presupposition is made & the beginning itself is taken immediately, then its only determination is that it is the beginning of logic",138
230,Absolute truth must be a result,31
231,Thus consciousness on its onward path from the immediacy with which it began is led back to absolute knowledge as its innermost truth,133
232,The whole of the science of logic must be within itself a circle in which the first is also the last and the last is also the first. ,133
233,"Absolute spirit at the end of the development is known as freely externalising itself, abandoning itself to the shape of an immediate being ",140
234,"On the other hand, it is equally necessary to consider as result that into which the movement returns as into its ground",120
235,The progress from that which forms the beginning is to be regarded as only a further determination of it,104
236,That which forms the starting point of the development remains at the base of all that follows and does not vanish from it.,123
237,"This pure being is the unity into which pure knowing withdraws,",63
238,"Here at the start, where the subject matter itself is not yet to hand, philosophy is an empty word or some assumed, unjustified conception",138
239,"Pure being is to be considered as the unity into which knowing has collapsed at the extreme point of its union with the object,",127
240,"In the beginning, being and nothing are present as distinguished from each other;",81
241,"That which begins already is, but equally, too, is not as yet.",62
242,"That which constitutes the beginning, the beginning itself, is to be taken as something unanalysable, taken in its simple unfilled immediacy",140
243,"Absolute truth must be a result, and a result presupposes a prior truth",71
244,"Absolute spirit reveals itself as freely externalising itself, abandoning itself to the shape of an immediate being",115
245,It is equally necessary to consider as result that into which the movement returns as into its ground.,102
246,"The beginning of philosophy is present & preserved throughout the development, remaining completely immanent in its further determinations",138
247,"Because that which forms the beginning is still undeveloped, devoid of content, it is not truly known in the beginning;",119
248,It lies in the very nature of a beginning that it must be being and nothing else.,81
249,"Where the subject matter itself is not yet to hand, philosophy is an empty word or some assumed, unjustified conception",119
250,"That which begins already is, but equally, too, is not as yet.",62
251,"The opposites being and nonbeing are therefore directly united in the beginning, or, otherwise expressed, it is their undifferentiated unity",140
252,"In this sense, the abstract concept would be the first definition of the absolute & all further determinations only richer definitions of it",140
253,"The beginning cannot be made with anything concrete, anything containing a relation within itself",97
254,"That which constitutes the beginning, the beginning itself, must be taken as something unanalysable, taken in its simple unfilled immediacy",139
255,But the ego as such is at the same time the most concrete of all things −− the consciousness of itself as an infinitely manifold world. ,136
256,The pure knowing which has in truth overcome the opposition of consciousness.,77
257,"If something concrete is taken as the beginning, the conjunction of the determinations contained in it demand proof, and this is lacking.",137
258,For only in what is simple is there nothing more than the pure beginning;,73
259,Pedantry is thus an affected thoroughness. - kant,49
260,"Practical importance cannot be foreseen, one must simply wait and watch for it - kant",85
261,Civilization has raised this latest era so far above the ancient antithesis of reason and faith,95
262,"The positive element with which reason busied itself to do battle, is no longer religion, and victorious reason is no longer reason. ",133
263,When thought is an instinctive activity the spirit is caught up in the web of its categories and is splintered into an infinite variety,135
264,Here and there on this web there are knots which give stability and direction to the life and consciousness of spirit,117
265,"Because spirit is essentially consciousness, this self-knowledge is a fundamental determination of its actuality",112
266,"By the little which now satisfies spirit, we can measure the extent of its loss",79
267,Philosophy must beware of the wish to be edifying,49
268,Spirit is indeed never at rest but always engaged in moving forward,67
269,"The gradual crumbling that left unaltered the face of the whole is cut short by a sunburst which, in one flash, illuminates the new world",137
270,The truth is the whole. but the whole is nothing other than the essence consummating itself through its development,115
271,"If the refutation is thorough, it is developed from the principle itself, not by counter-assertions & random thoughts from the outside",134
272,Truth is not a minted coin that can be given and pocketed ready-made,68
273,The true is thus the bacchanalian revel in which no member is not drunk,71
274,Being is only as the movement of nothingness to nothingness,59
275,"Reflection, as absolute reflection, is essence shining within",61
276,The hour of their birth is the hour of their death,50
277,Contradiction is the root of all movement and life,50
278,"Something is alive, therefore, only to the extent that it contains contradiction within itself",94
279,"If a contradiction can be pointed out in something, by itself this is still not, as it were, a blemish, not a defect or failure",127
280,"Mind, therefore, sets out only from its own being and is in relationship only with its own determinations",105
281,"Mind itself is this elevation above nature and natural determinacy, and above the involvement with an external object, i.e. above the material element in general",161
282,"Mind is thus the absolutely universal certainty of itself, free of any opposition whatever",90
283,"Free mind stands, like consciousness, as one side confronting the object, and is at the same time both sides and therefore, like the soul, a totality",149
284,Consciousness is finite insofar as it has an object,51
285,The soul is finite insofar as it is determined immediately or by nature,71
286,"It belongs to the concept of mind that within it the absolute unity of the subjective and objective be not merely in itself, but also for itself, and therefore object of knowledge",179
287,"The free mind is essentially active, productive",47
288,"It is not philosophy's business to take such untruths of contingent reality and of representation for the truth, to take what is bad for the nature of the matter",161
289,"Cognition is genuine just insofar as the intelligence actualizes it, i.e. posits the concept of cognition for itself",116
290,"A feeling, however pure and true its content may be, has the form of contingent particularity",93
291,"If a man on any topic appeals not to the nature and concept of the subject-matter ... but to his feeling, the only thing to do is to let him alone, because he thereby spurns the community of rationality, withdraws into his isolated subjectivity, into particularity",264
292,"A genuine poet, before and during the execution of his work, must meditate and think contemplatively; only in this way can he hope to extricate the heart or the soul of the matter from all the externalities in which it is shrouded",230
293,"The image, which in the pit of intelligence was only its property, is now, with the determination of externality, also in its possession",136
294,"Even the association of representations is to be conceived as subsumption of the individual representations under a universal representation, which forms the connection between them",181
295,"Intelligence is the power over the stock of images and representations belonging to it, and thus freely combines and subsumes this stock under its own particular content",169
296,"In fantasy intelligence has been perfected to self-intuition within itself, inasmuch as its content, derived from its own self, has pictorial existence",151
297,"The intuition, which in its immediacy is initially something given and spatial, acquires, insofar as it is used as a sign, the essential determination of occurring only as sublated",180
298,"The name is thus the ting, as the thing is available and carries weight in the realm of representation",102
299,"The name, as existence of the content within the intelligence, is the externality of intell. itself within itself; and the recollection of the name as the intuition produced by intell. is at the same time the self-externalization in which intelligence posits itself inside itself",279
300,"We obviously do not really know a composition by heart, until we attach no sense to the words",93
301,The recitation of what is thus known by heart therefore automatically becomes accentless [because we attach no sense to the words],130
302,"Intelligence knows that what is thought, is; and that what is, only is insofar as it is thought",95
303,"In intellectual thinking, the content is indifferent to its from, while in rational or conceptual cognition the content produces its form from its own self",155
304,"True freedom is ethical life, where the will has for its purposes a universal content, not subjective, i.e. self-centered, content",130
305,"Such [universal content of ethics] is only possible in thinking and through thinking; it is nothing less than absurd to want to exclude thinking from ethics, religion, lawfulness, &tc",183
306,"What more there is in feeling than in rationality is only particular subjectivity, vanity, and wilfulness",105
307,"The rational, which in the shape of rationality is something thought, is the same content as the good practical feeling has, but in its universality and necessity, in its objectivity and truth",192
308,Evil is nothing but the inadequacy of being to the ought,56
309,"In regard to contingent purposes, evil is only the justice that is imposed on the vanity and nullity of their devising. they themselves are already what is evil",160
310,"Passion is neither good nor evil; this form only expresses that a subject has placed the whole vital interest of its mind, talent, character, enjoyment in one content",166
311,"It only a dead, too often, indeed, a hypocritical morality which inveighs against the very form of passion",106
312,"The truth of particular satisfactions is the universal satisfaction, which the thinking will makes its purpose as happiness",123
313,"Knowledge of mind is the most concrete knowledge, and thus the highest and most difficult",89
314,Truth just means agreement of the concept with its actuality,60
315,"For us mind has nature as its presupposition, though mind is the truth of nature, and is thus absolutely first with respect to it",129
316,Mind is preceded not only by the lgical idea but also by external nature,72
317,Every determinacy is a determinacy only in contrast to another determinacy,74
318,"In the living creature, of course, there emerges a higher necessity than that which holds sway in lifeless things",113
319,The essence of mind is freedom,30
320,"Only when i come to apprehend myself as i, does the other become an object for me, confront me, and at the same time get posited ideally in me, and hence brought back to unity with me",183
321,"Consciousness as relationship involves only the categories belonging to the abstract i or to formal thinking; and these are, for it, determinations of the object",161
322,I grasp every object as a member in the system of what i myself am,66
323,"In consciousness, we see the tremendous difference, on the one side, of the i, this wholly simple entity, and on the other side, of the infinite variety of the world",165
324,"The oppostion of the i and the world, which does not yet come to genuine mediation here, constitutes the finitude of consciousness",130
325,This immediacy has no truth; we must advance from it to the essential being of the object,89
326,The non-living entity has no urges because it is incapable of enduring contradiction; it perishes when the other of itself forces its way into it,145
327,"The ensouled creature and the mind necessarily have urges, since neither the sould nor the mind can be, without having contradiction within themselves and either feeling it or being aware of it",193
328,The object is conformable to the desire and just for this reason desire is aroused by the object,96
329,"Although all alteration as such, which is posited by the activity of the subject, is the subject's deed, the subject does not for that reason recognize it as its action; it recognizes as its own only that reality in the deed which lay in its knowledge and will; ie its purpose",276
330,"Happiness is distinguished from well-being only in this, that happiness is conceived just as an immediate reality, whereas well-being is regarded as justifiable in relation to morality",184
331,"To the subject, who in the reality of his freedom essentially becomes a particular, his interest and well-being ought, because of the reality of his freedom, to be an essential aim and therefore a duty",201
332,"The good is thus posited as a contingency for the subject, who can therefore resolve on something opposed to the good, can be evil",130
333,"“genuine evil consists in our will not to resist the inclinations when they invite transgression"" - kant",104

355,Philosophy has to do with ideas and therefore not with what are commonly described as mere concepts (pr 25),107
356,The subject-matter of the philosophical science of right is the idea of right - the concept of right and its actualization (pr 25),130

1,"For the period seems to have been arrived at when Philosophy may again hope to receive some attention and love—this almost dead science may again raise its voice, and hope that the world which had become deaf to its teaching, may once more lend it an ear
- HoP 1",262
3,"Because the spirit of the world was thus occupied, it could not look within and withdraw into itself
- HoP 1",108
5,"In other words, along with the business of politics and the other interests of every-day life, we may trust that Science, the free rational world of mind, may again flourish
- HoP 1",181
7,"But the needs of the time and the interests of the events in the world already mentioned, have repressed a real and earnest effort after Philosophy and driven hence any general attention to it
- HoP 1",200
8,"It has thus happened that because vigorous natures turned to the practical, insipidity and dulness appropriated to themselves the preeminence in Philosophy and flourished there
- HoP 1",184

- HoP 1",254
17,"The Being of the universe, at first hidden and concealed, has no power which can offer resistance to the search for knowledge; it has to lay itself open before the seeker—to set before his eyes and give for his enjoyment, its riches and its depths
- HoP 1",255
19,"Indeed, this interest may seem to increase in the degree in which the ordinary conception of Philosophy, and of the end which its history serves, is reversed; for from the History of Philosophy a proof of the futility of the science is mainly derived
- HoP 1",258
20,"The demand that a history, whatever the subject may be, should state the facts without prejudice and without any particular object or end to be gained by its means, must be regarded as a fair one
- HoP 1",203
21,"But with a commonplace demand like this, we do not get far; for the history of a subject is necessarily intimately connected with the conception which is formed of it
- HoP 1",174
22,"In accordance with this what is important in it is determined, and the relation of the events to the end regulates the selection of facts to be recorded, the mode of comprehending them, and the point of view under which they are regarded

26,"The science of Philosophy has, however, this distinguishing feature, and, if you will, this disadvantage as compared with other sciences, that we find the most varied points of view as regards its Notion, and regarding that which it ought to and can accomplish
- HoP 1",268
28,"That drawback relates, however, only to an external consideration of this narrative; there is another and greater disadvantage allied to it
- HoP 1",147
29,"If there are different Notions of the science of Philosophy, it is the true Notion alone that puts us in a position to understand the writings of philosophers who have worked in the knowledge of it
- HoP 1",205
30,"For in thought, and particularly in speculative thought, comprehension means something quite different from understanding the grammatical sense of the words alone, and also from understanding them in the region of ordinary conception only
- HoP 1",246
32,"There is hence no lack of voluminous and even learned histories of Philosophy in which the knowledge of the matter itself about which so much ado has been made, is absent
- HoP 1",178
33,"The authors of such histories may be compared to animals which have listened to all the tones in some music, but to whose senses the unison, the harmony of their tones, has not penetrated
- HoP 1",195
34,"The circumstance mentioned makes it in no science so necessary as in the history of Philosophy to commence with an Introduction, and in it correctly to define, in the first place, the subject of the history about to be related
- HoP 1",234
35,"For it may be said, How should we begin to treat a subject, the name of which is certainly mentioned often enough, but of whose nature we as yet know nothing?
- HoP 1",166
36,"In treating the history of Philosophy thus, we could have no other guidance than that of seeking out and taking up whatever has received the name of Philosophy, anywhere or any time
- HoP 1",189
37,"But in fact, when the Notion of Philosophy is established, not arbitrarily but in a scientific way, such treatment becomes the science of Philosophy itself
- HoP 1",163

39,"In this Introduction the Notion of the science of Philosophy, of the subject of its history, has thus likewise to be set forth

40,"At the same time, though this Introduction professes to relate to the history of Philosophy only, what has just been said of Philosophy on the whole, also holds good

42,"These preparatory explanations are for this reason only, not to be placed in the category of arbitrary assumptions
- HoP 1",122
43,"But to begin with stating what in their justification are really results, can only have the interest which may be possessed by a summary, given in advance, of the most general contents of a science

45,"INTRODUCTION   THERE are various aspects under which the History of Philosophy may possess interest
- HoP 1",107
46,"We shall find the central point of this interest in the essential connection existing between what is apparently past and the present stage reached by Philosophy
- HoP 1",169
48,"The events and actions of this history are therefore such that personality and individual character do not enter to any large degree into its content and matter
- HoP 1",168
51,"The acts of thought appear at first to be a matter of history, and, therefore, things of the past, and outside our real existence
- HoP 1",137
52,"But in reality we are what we are through history: or, more accurately, as in the history of Thought, what has passed away is only one side, so in the present, what we have as a permanent possession is essentially bound up with our place in history
- HoP 1",256
53,"The possession of self-conscious reason, which belongs to us of the present world, did not arise suddenly, nor did it grow only from the soil of the present
- HoP 1",164
54,"This possession must be regarded as previously present, as an inheritance, and as the result of labour—the labour of all past generations of men
- HoP 1",152
56,"Thus has been preserved and transmitted to us what antiquity produced
- HoP 1",77
58,"Such tradition is no motionless statue, but is alive, and swells like a mighty river, which increases in size the further it advances from its source
- HoP 1",157
59,"The content of this tradition is that which the intellectual world has brought forth, and the universal Mind does not remain stationary
- HoP 1",143
60,"But it is just the universal Mind with which we have to do
- HoP 1",66
61,"It may certainly be the case with a single nation that its culture, art, science—its intellectual activities as a whole—are at a standstill
- HoP 1",147
62,"This appears, perhaps, to be the case with the Chinese, for example, who may have been as far advanced in every respect two thousand years ago as now
- HoP 1",157
63,"But the world-spirit does not sink into this rest of indifference; this follows from its very nature, for its activity is its life
- HoP 1",138
64,"This activity presupposes a material already present, on which it acts, and which it does not merely augment by the addition, of new matter, but completely fashions and transforms
- HoP 1",187
66,"To receive this inheritance is also to enter upon its use
- HoP 1",65
67,"It constitutes the soul of each successive generation, the intellectual substance of the time; its principles, prejudices, and possessions; and this legacy is degraded to a material which becomes metamorphosed by Mind
- HoP 1",225
68,"In this manner that which is received is changed, and the material worked upon is both enriched and preserved at the same time
- HoP 1",134
69,"This is the function of our own and of every age: to grasp the knowledge which is already existing, to make it our own, and in so doing to develop it still further and to raise it to a higher level
- HoP 1",205
70,"In thus appropriating it to ourselves we make it into something different from what it was before
- HoP 1",105
71,"On the presupposition of an already existing intellectual world which is transformed in our appropriation of it, depends the fact that Philosophy can only arise in connection with previous Philosophy, from which of necessity it has arisen
- HoP 1",246
72,"The course of history does not show us the Becoming of things foreign to us, but the Becoming of ourselves and of our own knowledge
- HoP 1",139
73,"The ideas and questions which may be present to our mind regarding the character and ends of the history of Philosophy, depend on the nature of the relationship here given
- HoP 1",179
74,"In this lies the explanation of the fact that the study of the history of Philosophy is an introduction to Philosophy itself
- HoP 1",132
75,"The guiding principles for the formation of this history are given in this fact, the further discussion of which must thus be the main object of this introduction
- HoP 1",170
77,"This Becoming is not merely a passive movement, as we suppose movements such as those of the sun and moon to be
- HoP 1",119
78,"It is no mere movement in the unresisting medium of space and time
- HoP 1",74
79,"What we must represent to ourselves is the activity of free thought; we have to present the history of the world of thought as it has arisen and produced itself
- HoP 1",168
80,"There is an old tradition that it is the faculty of thought which separates men from beasts; and to this tradition we shall adhere
- HoP 1",138
81,"In accordance with this, what man has, as being nobler than a beast, he has through thinking
- HoP 1",100
82,"Everything which is human, however it may appear, is so only because the thought contained in it works and has worked
- HoP 1",125
83,"But thought, although it is thus the essential, substantial, and effectual, has many other elements
- HoP 1",107
84,"We must, however, consider it best when Thought does not pursue anything else, but is occupied only with itself—with what is noblest—when it has sought and found itself
- HoP 1",176
85,"The history which we have before us is the history of Thought finding itself, and it is the case with Thought that it only finds itself in producing itself; indeed, that it only exists and is actual in finding itself
- HoP 1",224
86,"These productions are the philosophic systems; and the series of discoveries on which Thought sets out in order to discover itself, forms a work which has lasted twenty-five hundred years
- HoP 1",195
87,"If the Thought which is essentially Thought, is in and for itself and eternal, and that which is true is contained in Thought alone, how, then, does this intellectual world come to have a history?
- HoP 1",204
88,"In history what appears is transient, has disappeared in the night of the past and is no more
- HoP 1",101
89,"But true, necessary thought—and it is only with such that we have to do—is capable of no change
- HoP 1",103
90,"The question here raised constitutes one of those matters first to be brought under our consideration
- HoP 1",109
91,"But in the second place, there are also many most important things outside of Philosophy, which are yet the work of Thought, and which are left unconsidered
- HoP 1",164
92,"Such are Religion, Political History, forms of Government, and the Arts and Sciences
- HoP 1",92
93,"The question arises as to how these operations differ from the subject of consideration, and how they are related in history?
- HoP 1",133
94,"As regards these two points of view, it is desirable to show in what sense the history of Philosophy is here taken, in order to see clearly what we are about
- HoP 1",165
95,"Moreover, in the third place, we must first take a general survey before we descend to particulars, else the whole is not seen for the mere details—the wood is not seen for the trees, nor Philosophy for mere philosophies
- HoP 1",228
96,"Just as we first desire to obtain a general idea of a country, which we should no longer see in going into detail, so we desire to see the relation which single philosophies bear to the whole; for in reality, the high value of the detail lies in its relation to the whole
- HoP 1",279
97,"This is nowhere more the case than with Philosophy, and also with its history
- HoP 1",85
98,"In the case of a history, indeed, the establishment of the Universal seems to be less needful than in that of one of the sciences proper
- HoP 1",144
99,"For history seems at first to be a succession of chance events, in which each fact stands isolated by itself, which has Time alone as a connecting-link
- HoP 1",159
100,"But even in political history we are not satisfied with this
- HoP 1",68
101,"We see, or at least divine in it, that essential connection in which the individual events have their place and relation to an end or aim, and in this way obtain significance
- HoP 1",182
102,"For the significant in history is such only through its relation to and connection with a Universal
- HoP 1",107
103,"To perceive this Universal is thus to apprehend the significance
- HoP 1",72
104,"There are, therefore, the following points with which I wish to deal in this introduction
- HoP 1",97
105,"The first of these will be to investigate the character of the history of Philosophy, its significance, its nature, and its aim, from which will follow inferences as to its treatment
- HoP 1",190
106,"In particular, we shall get an insight into the relation of the history of Philosophy to the science of Philosophy, and this will be the most interesting point of all
- HoP 1",174
107,"That is to say, this history represents, not merely the external, accidental, events contained within it, but it shows how the content, or that which appears to belong to mere history, really belongs to the science of Philosophy
- HoP 1",236
108,"The history of Philosophy is itself scientific, and thus essentially becomes the science of Philosophy
- HoP 1",110
109,"In the second place, the Notion of Philosophy must be more adequately determined, and from it must be deduced what should be excluded from the history of Philosophy out of the infinite material and the manifold aspects of the intellectual culture of the nations
- HoP 1",269
111,"It might be supposed that the history of Philosophy should take account of all these ideas
- HoP 1",98
112,"Has not everything been called Philosophy and philosophizing?
- HoP 1",69
113,"On the one hand, the close connection has to be further considered in which Philosophy stands with its allied subjects, religion, art, the other sciences, and likewise with political history
- HoP 1",198
116,"And I will not occupy further space with reflections on the use of the history of Philosophy, and other methods of treating it
- HoP 1",134
117,"The use is evident
- HoP 1",26
118,"But, in conclusion, I wish to consider the sources of the history of Philosophy, for this is customary
- HoP 1",110
119,"THE thought which may first occur to us in the history of Philosophy, is that the subject itself contains an inner contradiction
- HoP 1",136
120,"For Philosophy aims at understanding what is unchangeable, eternal, in and for itself: its end is Truth
- HoP 1",111
121,"But history tells us of that which has at one time existed, at another time has vanished, having been expelled by something else
- HoP 1",136
122,"Truth is eternal; it does not fall within the sphere of the transient, and has no history
- HoP 1",97
123,"But if it has a history, and as this history is only the representation of a succession of past forms of knowledge, the truth is not to be found in it, for the truth cannot be what has passed away
- HoP 1",204
125,"But in order to get a better understanding of this apparent contradiction, we must distinguish between the outward history of a religion or a science and the history of the subject itself
- HoP 1",195
126,"And then we must take into account that the history of Philosophy because of the special nature of its subject-matter, is different from other histories
- HoP 1",160
127,"It is at once evident that the contradiction in question could not refer to the outward history, but merely to the inward, or that of the content itself
- HoP 1",160
128,"There is a history of the spread of Christianity and of the lives of those who have avowed it, and its existence has formed itself into that of a Church
- HoP 1",160
129,"This in itself constitutes an external existence such that being brought into contact with temporal affairs of the most diverse kind, its lot is a varied one and it essentially possesses a history
- HoP 1",204
130,"And of the Christian doctrine it is true that it, too, has its history, but it necessarily soon reached its full development and attained to its appointed powers
- HoP 1",169
131,"And this old creed has been an acknowledged influence to every age, and will still be acknowledged unchanged as the Truth, even though this acknowledgment were become no more than a pretence, and the words an empty form
- HoP 1",227
133,"The other sciences, including Philosophy, have also an external history like Religion
- HoP 1",93
134,"Philosophy has a history of its origin, diffusion, maturity, decay, revival; a history of its teachers, promoters, and of its opponents—often, too, of an outward relation to religion and occasionally to the State
- HoP 1",220
135,"This side of its history likewise gives occasion to interesting questions
- HoP 1",81
136,"Amongst other such, it is asked why Philosophy, the doctrine of absolute Truth, seems to have revealed itself on the whole to a small number of individuals, to special nations, and how it has limited itself to particular periods of time
- HoP 1",244
139,"But as regards the comparison between the history of Religion and that of Philosophy as to inner content, there is not in the latter as there is in Religion a fixed and fundamental truth which, as unchangeable, is apart from history
- HoP 1",240
140,"The content of Christianity, which is Truth, has, however, remained unaltered as such, and has therefore little history or as good as none2 Hence in Religion, on account of its very nature as Christianity, the conflict referred to disappears
- HoP 1",249
141,"The errors and additions constitute no difficulty
- HoP 1",57
142,"They are transitory and altogether historical in character
- HoP 1",66
143,"The other sciences, indeed, have also according to their content a History, a part of which relates to alterations, and the renunciation of tenets which were formerly current
- HoP 1",182
144,"But a great, perhaps the greater, part of the history relates to what has proved permanent, so that what was new, was not an alteration on earlier acquisitions, but an addition to them
- HoP 1",192
145,"These sciences progress through a process of juxtaposition
- HoP 1",66
146,"It is true that in Botany, Mineralogy, and so on, much is dependent on what was previously known, but by far the greatest part remains stationary and by means of fresh matter is merely added to without itself being affected by the addition
- HoP 1",247
147,"Thus to take an example, elementary geometry in so far as it was created by Euclid, may from his time on be regarded as having no further history
- HoP 1",153
148,"The history of Philosophy, on the other hand, shows neither the motionlessness of a complete, simple content, nor altogether the onward movement of a peaceful addition of new treasures to those already acquired
- HoP 1",218
149,"It seems merely to afford the spectacle of ever-recurring changes in the whole, such as finally are no longer even connected by a common aim
- HoP 1",148
150,"At this point appear these ordinary superficial ideas regarding the history of Philosophy which have to be referred to and corrected
- HoP 1",140
152,"The History of Philosophy as an accumulation of Opinions
- HoP 1",64
153,"History, at the first glance, includes in its aim the narration of the accidental circumstances of times, of races, and of individuals, treated impartially partly as regards their relation in time, and partly as to their content
- HoP 1",236
154,"The appearance of contingency in time-succession is to be dealt with later on
- HoP 1",85
155,"It is contingency of content which is the idea with which we have first to deal—the idea of contingent actions
- HoP 1",118
156,"But thoughts and not external actions, or griefs, or joys, form the content of Philosophy
- HoP 1",97
157,"Contingent thoughts, however, are nothing but opinions, and philosophical opinions are opinions relating to the more special content of Philosophy, regarding God, Nature and Spirit
- HoP 1",188
158,"Thus we now meet the view very usually taken of the history of Philosophy which ascribes to it the narration of a number of philosophical opinions as they have arisen and manifested themselves in time
- HoP 1",208
159,"This kind of matter is in courtesy called opinions; those who think themselves more capable of judging rightly, call such a history a display of senseless follies, or at least of errors made by men engrossed in thought and in mere ideas
- HoP 1",244
160,"This view is not only held by those who recognize their ignorance of Philosophy
- HoP 1",87
162,"But the same view is even held by those who write or have written on the history of Philosophy
- HoP 1",102
163,"This history, considered only as the enumeration of various opinions, thus becomes an idle tale, or, if you will, an erudite investigation
- HoP 1",146
164,"For erudition is, in the main, acquaintance with a number of useless things, that is to say, with that which has no intrinsic interest or value further than being known
- HoP 1",176
165,"Yet it is thought that profit is to be derived from learning the various opinions and reflections of other men
- HoP 1",118
166,"It stimulates the powers of thought and also leads to many excellent reflections; this signifies that now and then it occasions an idea, and its art thus consists in the spinning one opinion out of the other
- HoP 1",215
168,"What can be more useless than to learn a string of bald opinions, and what more unimportant?
- HoP 1",100
169,"Literary works, being histories of Philosophy in the sense that they produce and treat the ideas of Philosophy as if they were opinions, need be only superficially glanced at to find how dry and destitute of interest everything about them is
- HoP 1",249
170,"An opinion is a subjective conception, an uncontrolled thought, an idea which may occur to me in one direction or in another: an opinion is mine,3 it is in itself a universal thought which is existent in and for itself
- HoP 1",226
171,"But Philosophy possesses no opinions, for there is no such thing as philosophical opinions
- HoP 1",98
172,"Philosophy is the objective science of truth, it is science of necessity, conceiving knowledge, and neither opinion nor the spinning out of opinions
- HoP 1",156
173,"The more precise significance of this idea is that we get to know opinions only, thus laying emphasis upon the word Opinion
- HoP 1",131
174,"Now the direct opposite of opinion is the Truth; it is Truth before which mere opinion pales
- HoP 1",100
175,"Those who in the history of Philosophy seek mere theories, or who suppose that on the whole only such are to be found within it, also turn aside when that word Truth confronts them
- HoP 1",188
176,"Philosophy here encounters opposition from two different sides
- HoP 1",70
178,"Of the relation existing between Religion and Philosophy and of its history, we shall deal later on
- HoP 1",107
180,"But this affirmation of the right of reason is turned round in an astonishing manner, so that it results in making knowledge of the truth through reason an impossibility
- HoP 1",177
181,"This so-called reason on the one hand has combated religious faith in the name and power of thinking reason, and at the same time it has itself turned against reason and is true reason’s adversary
- HoP 1",204
182,"Instinct and feeling are maintained by it against the true reason, thus making the measure of true value the merely subjective—that is a particular conviction such as each can form in and for himself in his subjective capacity
- HoP 1",234
183,"A personal conviction such as this is no more than the particular opinion that has become final for men
- HoP 1",111
184,"If we begin with what meets us in our very first conceptions, we cannot neglect to make mention of this aspect in the history of Philosophy
- HoP 1",147
185,"In its results it permeates culture generally, being at once the misconception and true sign of our times
- HoP 1",113
186,"It is the principle through which men mutually understand and know each other; an hypothesis whose value is established and which is the ground of all the other sciences
- HoP 1",177
187,"In theology it is not so much the creed of the church that passes for Christianity, as that every one to a greater or less degree makes a Christianity of his own to tally with his conviction
- HoP 1",198
189,"The endeavour to know the Truth is then of course relinquished
- HoP 1",70
190,"It is true that personal conviction is the ultimate and absolute essential which reason and its philosophy, from a subjective point of view, demand in knowledge
- HoP 1",168
192,"In the former case conviction is opinion
- HoP 1",48
193,"This opposition between mere opinion and truth now sharply defined, we already recognize in the culture of the period of Socrates and Plato—a period of corruption in Greek life—as the Platonic opposition between opinion δόξα and Science ἐπιστήμη
- HoP 1",253
194,"It is the same opposition as that which existed in the decadence of Roman public and political life under Augustus, and subsequently when Epicureanism and indifference set themselves up against Philosophy
- HoP 1",212
195,"Who makes this statement has gone beyond it indeed
- HoP 1",58
197,"To the impartial man, the Truth has always been a heart-stirring word and one of great import
- HoP 1",101
198,"As to the assertion that the Truth cannot be known, we shall consider it more closely in the history of Philosophy itself where it appears
- HoP 1",146
199,"The only thing to be here remarked is that if this assumption be allowed, as was the case with Tennemann, it is beyond conception why anyone should still trouble about Philosophy, since each opinion asserts falsely in its turn that it has found the truth
- HoP 1",262
201,"Proof of the futility of Philosophical Knowledge obtained through the History of Philosophy itself
- HoP 1",106
202,"From another point of view another consequence ensues from the above conception of the history of Philosophy which may at will be looked at as an evil or a benefit
- HoP 1",171
203,"In view of such manifold opinions and philosophical systems so numerous, one is perplexed to know which one ought to be accepted
- HoP 1",136
204,"In regard to the great matters to which man is attracted and a knowledge of which Philosophy would bestow, it is evident that the greatest minds have erred, because they have been contradicted by others
- HoP 1",210
206,"But this diversity in philosophical systems is far from being merely an evasive plea
- HoP 1",92
207,"It has far more weight as a genuine serious ground of argument against the zeal which Philosophy requires
- HoP 1",113
208,"It justifies its neglect and demonstrates conclusively the powerlessness of the endeavour to attain to philosophic knowledge of the truth
- HoP 1",145
209,"Each one asserts its genuineness, each even gives different signs and tokens by which the Truth can be discovered; sober reflective thought must therefore hesitate to give its judgment
- HoP 1",192
210,"This, then, is the wider interest which the history of Philosophy is said to afford
- HoP 1",91
211,"He puts it in the mouth of an Epicurean, but he himself knew of nothing more favourable to say, and it is thus his own view
- HoP 1",131
212,"The Epicurean says that no certain knowledge has been arrived at
- HoP 1",72
215,"Instead of “Follow thou Me,” here then it must indeed be said, “Follow thine own self”—that is, hold by thine own convictions, remain steadfast to thine own opinion, why adopt another?
- HoP 1",192
218,"Certainly the fact is sufficiently well established that there are and have been different philosophies
- HoP 1",111
219,"The Truth is, however, one; and the instinct of reason maintains this irradicable intuition or belief
- HoP 1",109
220,"It is said that only one philosophy can be true, and, because philosophies are different, it is concluded that all others must be erroneous
- HoP 1",147
221,"But, in fact, each one in turn gives every assurance, evidence and proof of being the one and true Philosophy
- HoP 1",117
222,"This is a common mode of reasoning and is what seems in truth to be the view of sober thought
- HoP 1",101
223,"As regards the sober nature of the word at issue—thought—we can tell from every-day experience that if we fast we feel hunger either at once or very soon
- HoP 1",161
224,"But sober thought always has the fortunate power of not resulting in hunger and desire, but of being and remaining as it is, content
- HoP 1",140
225,"Hence the thought expressed in such an utterance reveals the fact that it is dead understanding; for it is only death which fasts and yet rests satisfied
- HoP 1",161
226,"But neither physical life nor intellectual remains content with mere abstention; as desire it presses on through hunger and through thirst towards Truth, towards knowledge itself
- HoP 1",186
227,"It presses on to satisfy this desire and does not allow itself to feast and find sufficiency in a reflection such as this
- HoP 1",129
228,"As to this reflection, the next thing to be said of it is that however different the philosophies have been, they had a common bond in that they were Philosophy
- HoP 1",168
229,"Thus whoever may have studied or become acquainted with a philosophy, of whatever kind, provided only that it is such, has thereby become acquainted with Philosophy
- HoP 1",172
231,"But it is really important to have a deeper insight into the bearings of this diversity in the systems of Philosophy
- HoP 1",124
232,"Truth and Philosophy known philosophically, make such diversity appear in another light from that of abstract opposition between Truth and Error
- HoP 1",152
233,"The explanation of how this comes about will reveal to us the significance of the whole history of Philosophy
- HoP 1",117
235,"Further we find that in the history of Philosophy we have to deal with Philosophy itself
- HoP 1",96
236,"The facts within that history are not adventures and contain no more romance than does the history of the world
- HoP 1",119
237,"They are not a mere collection of chance events, of expeditions of wandering knights, each going about fighting, struggling purposelessly, leaving no results to show for all his efforts
- HoP 1",193
238,"Nor is it so that one thing has been thought out here, another there, at will; in the activity of thinking mind there is real connection, and what there takes place is rational
- HoP 1",184
239,"It is with this belief in the spirit of the world that we must proceed to history, and in particular to the history of Philosophy
- HoP 1",137
240,"The above statement, that the Truth is only one, is still abstract and formal
- HoP 1",85
241,"In the deeper sense it is our starting point
- HoP 1",52
243,"Thus what is most essential is to know that the single truth is not merely a solitary, empty thought, but one determined within itself
- HoP 1",142
244,"To obtain this knowledge we must enter into some abstract Notions which, as such, are quite general and dry, and which are the two principles of Development and of the Concrete
- HoP 1",184
245,"We could, indeed, embrace the whole in the single principle of development; if this were clear, all else would result and follow of its own accord
- HoP 1",154
246,"The product of thinking is the thought; thought is, however, still formal; somewhat more defined it becomes Notion, and finally Idea is Thought in its totality, implicitly and explicitly determined
- HoP 1",205
247,"Thus the Idea, and it alone is Truth
- HoP 1",44
248,"Now it is essentially in the nature of the Idea to develop, and only through development to arrive at comprehension of itself, or to become what it is
- HoP 1",158
249,"That the Idea should have to make itself what it is, seems like a contradiction; it may be said that it is what it is
- HoP 1",125
250,"The idea of development is well known, but it is the special characteristic of Philosophy to investigate such matters as were formerly held as known
- HoP 1",156
251,"The further discussion of this idea belongs to the science of Logic
- HoP 1",75
252,"In order to comprehend what development is, what may be called two different states must be distinguished
- HoP 1",113
253,"The first is what is known as capacity, power, what I call being-in-itself (potentia, δύναμις); the second principle is that of being-for-itself, actuality (actus, ἐνέργεια)
- HoP 1",181
254,"If we say, for example, that man is by nature rational, we would mean that he has reason only inherently or in embryo: in this sense, reason, understanding, imagination, will, are possessed from birth or even from the mother’s womb
- HoP 1",239
255,"But while the child only has capacities or the actual possibility of reason, it is just the same as if he had no reason; reason does not yet exist in him since he cannot yet do anything rational, and has no rational consciousness
- HoP 1",237
256,"Thus what man is at first implicitly becomes explicit, and it is the same with reason
- HoP 1",93
257,"If, then, man has actuality on whatever side, he is actually rational; and now we come to reason
- HoP 1",104
258,"What is the real meaning of this word?
- HoP 1",46
259,"That which is in itself must become an object to mankind, must arrive at consciousness, thus becoming for man
- HoP 1",117
260,"What has become an object to him is the same as what he is in himself; through the becoming objective of this implicit being, man first becomes for himself; he is made double, is retained and not changed into another
- HoP 1",224
261,"For example, man is thinking, and thus he thinks out thoughts
- HoP 1",69
262,"In this way it is in thought alone that thought is object; reason produces what is rational: reason is its own object
- HoP 1",125
263,"The fact that thought may also descend to what is destitute of reason is a consideration involving wider issues, which do not concern us here
- HoP 1",149
265,"The whole variation in the development of the world in history is founded on this difference
- HoP 1",100
266,"This alone explains how since all mankind is naturally rational, and freedom is the hypothesis on which this reason rests, slavery yet has been, and in part still is, maintained by many peoples, and men have remained contented under it
- HoP 1",243
268,"This constitutes the enormous difference in their condition
- HoP 1",67
269,"All knowledge, and learning, science, and even commerce have no other object than to draw out what is inward or implicit and thus to become objective
- HoP 1",157
270,"Because that which is implicit comes into existence, it certainly passes into change, yet it remains one and the same, for the whole process is dominated by it
- HoP 1",167
271,"The plant, for example, does not lose itself in mere indefinite change
- HoP 1",78
272,"From the germ much is produced when at first nothing was to be seen; but the whole of what is brought forth, if not developed, is yet hidden and ideally contained within itself
- HoP 1",184
273,"The principle of this projection into existence is that the germ cannot remain merely implicit, but is impelled towards development, since it presents the contradiction of being only implicit and yet not desiring so to be
- HoP 1",229
274,"But this coming without itself has an end in view; its completion fully reached, and its previously determined end is the fruit or produce of the germ, which causes a return to the first condition
- HoP 1",204
275,"The germ will produce itself alone and manifest what is contained in it, so that it then may return to itself once more thus to renew the unity from which it started
- HoP 1",173
276,"With nature it certainly is true that the subject which commenced and the matter which forms the end are two separate units, as in the case of seed and fruit
- HoP 1",165
277,"The doubling process has apparently the effect of separating into two things that which in content is the same
- HoP 1",118
278,"Thus in animal life the parent and the young are different individuals although their nature is the same
- HoP 1",112
279,"In Mind it is otherwise: it is consciousness and therefore it is free, uniting in itself the beginning and the end
- HoP 1",122
280,"As with the germ in nature, Mind indeed resolves itself back into unity after constituting itself another
- HoP 1",113
281,"But what is in itself becomes for Mind and thus arrives at being for itself
- HoP 1",83
282,"The fruit and seed newly contained within it on the other hand, do not become for the original germ, but for us alone; in the case of Mind both factors not only are implicitly the same in character, but there is a being for the other and at the same time a being for self
- HoP 1",279
283,"That for which the “other” is, is the same as that “other;” and thus alone Mind is at home with itself in its “other” The development of Mind lies in the fact that its going forth and separation constitutes its coming to itself
- HoP 1",235
284,"This being-at-home-with-self, or coming-to-self of Mind may be described as its complete and highest end: it is this alone that it desires and nothing else
- HoP 1",163
286,"Only in this manner does Mind attain its freedom, for that is free which is not connected with or dependent on another
- HoP 1",126
287,"True self-possession and satisfaction are only to be found in this, and in nothing else but Thought does Mind attain this freedom
- HoP 1",137
288,"In sense-perception, for instance, and in feeling, I find myself confined and am not free; but I am free when I have a consciousness of this my feeling
- HoP 1",159
289,"Man has particular ends and interests even in will; I am free indeed when this is mine
- HoP 1",94
290,"Such ends, however, always contain “another,” or something which constitutes for me “another,” such as desire and impulse
- HoP 1",129
291,"It is in Thought alone that all foreign matter disappears from view, and that Mind is absolutely free
- HoP 1",109
292,"All interest which is contained in the Idea and in Philosophy is expressed in it
- HoP 1",88
293,"As to development, it may be asked, what does develop and what forms the absolute content?
- HoP 1",98
294,"Development is considered in the light of a formal process in action and as destitute of content
- HoP 1",104
295,"But the act has no other end but activity, and through this activity the general character of the content is already fixed
- HoP 1",130
296,"For being-in-self and being-for-self are the moments present in action; but the act is the retention of these diverse elements within itself
- HoP 1",148
297,"The act thus is really one, and it is just this unity of differences which is the concrete
- HoP 1",98
298,"Not only is the act concrete, but also the implicit, which stands to action in the relation of subject which begins, and finally the product is just as concrete as the action or as the subject which begins
- HoP 1",213
299,"Development in process likewise forms the content, the Idea itself; for this we must have the one element and then the other: both combined will form a unity as third, because the one in the other is at home with, and not without, itself
- HoP 1",245
300,"Thus the Idea is in its content concrete within itself, and this in two ways: first it is concrete potentially, and then it is its interest that what is in itself should be there for it
- HoP 1",193
302,"As a matter of fact, Philosophy is in the region of thought, and has therefore to deal with universals; its content is abstract, but only as to form and element
- HoP 1",168
303,"In itself the Idea is really concrete, for it is the union of the different determinations
- HoP 1",98
305,"If the Truth is abstract it must be untrue
- HoP 1",50
306,"Healthy human reason goes out towards what is concrete; the reflection of the understanding comes first as abstract and untrue, correct in theory only, and amongst other things unpractical
- HoP 1",196
307,"Philosophy is what is most antagonistic to abstraction, and it leads back to the concrete
- HoP 1",97
308,"If we unite the Notion of the concrete with that of development we have the motion of the concrete
- HoP 1",106
309,"Since the implicit is already concrete within itself, and we only set forth what is implicitly there, the new form which now looks different and which was formerly shut up in the original unity, is merely distinguished
- HoP 1",226
310,"The concrete must become for itself or explicit; as implicit or potential it is only differentiated within itself, not as yet explicitly set forth, but still in a state of unity
- HoP 1",185
311,"The concrete is thus simple, and yet at the same time differentiated
- HoP 1",76
312,"This, its inward contradiction, which is indeed the impelling force in development, brings distinction into being
- HoP 1",121
313,"But thus, too, its right to be taken back and reinstated extends beyond the difference; for its truth is only to be found in unity
- HoP 1",138
314,"Life, both that which is in Nature and that which is of the Idea, of Mind within itself, is thus manifested
- HoP 1",115
315,"Were the Idea abstract, it would simply be the highest conceivable existence, and that would be all that could be said of it; but such a God is the product of the understanding of modern times
- HoP 1",200
316,"What is true is rather found in motion, in a process, however, in which there is rest; difference, while it lasts, is but a temporary condition, through which comes unity, full and concrete
- HoP 1",197
317,"We may now proceed to give examples of sensuous things, which will help us further to explain this Notion of the concrete
- HoP 1",129
318,"Although the flower has many qualities, such as smell, taste, form, colour, &c, yet it is one
- HoP 1",101
319,"None of these qualities could be absent in the particular leaf or flower: each individual part of the leaf shares alike all the qualities of the leaf entire
- HoP 1",164
320,"Gold, similarly contains in every particle all its qualities unseparated and entire
- HoP 1",91
321,"It is frequently allowed with sensuous things that such varied elements may be joined together, but, in the spiritual, differentiation is supposed to involve opposition
- HoP 1",176
322,"But the understanding and understanding thought find everything of a different kind, placed in conjunction, to be incompatible
- HoP 1",134
323,"Matter, for example, is complex and coherent, or space is continuous and uninterrupted
- HoP 1",94
324,"Likewise we may take separate points in space and break up matter dividing it ever further into infinity
- HoP 1",112
325,"It then is said that matter consists of atoms and points, and hence is not continuous
- HoP 1",93
326,"Therefore we have here the two determinations of continuity and of definite points, which understanding regards as mutually exclusive, combined in one
- HoP 1",158
327,"It is said that matter must be clearly either continuous or divisible into points, but in reality it has both these qualities
- HoP 1",133
329,"The distinctions here are regarded as exclusive, and not as forming something concrete
- HoP 1",94
330,"But that which is true, the Mind, is concrete, and its attributes are freedom and necessity
- HoP 1",99
331,"Similarly the higher point of view is that Mind is free in its necessity, and finds its freedom in it alone, since its necessity rests on its freedom
- HoP 1",157
332,"But it is more difficult for us to show the unity here than in the case of natural objects
- HoP 1",98
333,"Freedom can, however, be also abstract freedom without necessity, which false freedom is self-will, and for that reason it is self-opposed, unconsciously limited, an imaginary freedom which is free in form alone
- HoP 1",219
334,"The fruit of development, which comes third, is a result of motion, but inasmuch as it is merely the result of one stage in development, as being last in this stage, it is both the starting point and the first in order in another such stage
- HoP 1",248
335,"Goethe somewhere truly says, “That which is formed ever resolves itself back into its elements” Matter—which as developed has form—constitutes once more the material for a new form
- HoP 1",188
336,"Mind again takes as its object and applies its activity to the Notion in which in going within itself, it has comprehended itself, which it is in form and being, and which has just been separated from it anew
- HoP 1",216
337,"The application of thought to this, supplies it with the form and determination of thought
- HoP 1",98
338,"This action thus further forms the previously formed, gives it additional determinations, makes it more determinate in itself, further developed and more profound
- HoP 1",170
340,"Having thus generally explained the nature of the Concrete, I now add as regards its import, that the Truth thus determined within itself is impelled towards development
- HoP 1",177
341,"It is only the living and spiritual which internally bestirs and develops itself
- HoP 1",88
342,"Thus the Idea as concrete in itself, and self-developing, is an organic system and a totality which contains a multitude of stages and of moments in development
- HoP 1",168
343,"Philosophy has now become for itself the apprehension of this development, and as conceiving Thought, is itself this development in Thought
- HoP 1",147
344,"The more progress made in this development, the more perfect is the Philosophy
- HoP 1",86
345,"This development goes no further out than into externality, but the going without itself of development also is a going inwards
- HoP 1",135
346,"That is to say, the universal Idea continues to remain at the foundation and still is the all-embracing and unchangeable
- HoP 1",128
347,"Further development of the Idea or its further determination is the same thing exactly
- HoP 1",94
348,"Depth seems to signify intensiveness, but in this case the most extensive is also the most intensive
- HoP 1",108
349,"The more intensive is the Mind, the more extensive is it, hence the larger is its embrace
- HoP 1",97
350,"Extension as development, is not dispersion or falling asunder, but a uniting bond which is the more powerful and intense as the expanse of that embraced is greater in extent and richer
- HoP 1",193
351,"In such a case what is greater is the strength of opposition and of separation; and the greater power overcomes the greater separation
- HoP 1",142
353,"All the parts represented in it, and their systematization, emanate from the one Idea; all these particulars are but the mirrors and copies of this one life, and have their actuality only in this unity
- HoP 1",209
354,"Their differences and their various qualities are only the expression of the Idea and the form contained within it
- HoP 1",122
355,"Thus the Idea is the central point, which is also the periphery, the source of light, which in all its expansion does not come without itself, but remains present and immanent within itself
- HoP 1",197
356,"Thus it is both the system of necessity and its own necessity, which also constitutes its freedom
- HoP 1",105
357,"Thus we see that Philosophy is system in development; the history of Philosophy is the same; and this is the main point to be noted and the first principle to be dealt with in this treatise on that history
- HoP 1",213
358,"In order to make this evident, the difference in respect to the possible modes of manifestation must first be pointed out
- HoP 1",129
359,"That is to say, the progression of the various stages in the advance of Thought may occur with the consciousness of necessity, in which case each in succession deduces itself, and this form and this determination can alone emerge
- HoP 1",237
360,"Or else it may come about without this consciousness as does a natural and apparently accidental process, so that while inwardly, indeed, the Notion brings about its result consistently, this consistency is not made manifest
- HoP 1",232
361,"This is so in nature; in the various stages of the development of twigs, leaves, blossom and fruit, each proceeds for itself, but the inward Idea is the directing and determining force which governs the progression
- HoP 1",222
365,"This point of view is the only one worthy of this science
- HoP 1",65
366,"From the very nature of the subject it is inherently the true one, and through the study of this history it will be made manifest that it actually shows and proves itself so
- HoP 1",181
367,"Now in reference to this Idea, I maintain that the sequence in the systems of Philosophy in History is similar to the sequence in the logical deduction of the Notion-determinations in the Idea
- HoP 1",200
369,"Conversely in the logical progression taken for itself, there is, so far as its principal elements are concerned, the progression of historical manifestations; but it is necessary to have these pure Notions in order to know what the historical form contains
- HoP 1",265
370,"It may be thought that Philosophy must have another order as to the stages in the Idea than that in which these Notions have gone forth in time; but in the main the order is the same
- HoP 1",190
371,"This succession undoubtedly separates itself, on the one hand, into the sequence in time of History, and on the other into succession in the order of ideas
- HoP 1",163
372,"But to treat more fully of this last would divert us too far from our aim
- HoP 1",81
373,"I would only remark this, that what has been said reveals that the study of the history of Philosophy is the study of Philosophy itself, for, indeed, it can be nothing else
- HoP 1",180
375,"Else, indeed, as in so many histories of Philosophy, there is presented to the vision devoid of idea, only a disarranged collection of opinions
- HoP 1",151
376,"To make you acquainted with this Idea, and consequently to explain the manifestations, is the business of the history of Philosophy, and to do this is my object in undertaking to lecture on the subject
- HoP 1",209
378,"They are freaks of thought which, indeed, have been devised with a great pretension of acuteness and of mental exertion, and with everything else which can be said in admiration of what is merely formal
- HoP 1",210
379,"But, considering the absence of philosophic mind in such historians as these, how should they be able to comprehend and represent the content, which is reasoned thought?
- HoP 1",177
380,"It is shown from what has been said regarding the formal nature of the Idea, that only a history of Philosophy thus regarded as a system of development in Idea, is entitled to the name of Science: a collection of facts constitutes no science
- HoP 1",249
381,"Only thus as a succession of phenomena established through reason, and having as content just what is reason and revealing it, does this history show that it is rational: it shows that the events recorded are in reason
- HoP 1",226
382,"How should the whole of what has taken place in reason not itself be rational?
- HoP 1",86
383,"That faith must surely be the more reasonable in which chance is not made ruler over human affairs, and it is the business of Philosophy to recognize that however much its own manifestations may be history likewise, it is yet determined through the Idea alone
- HoP 1",267
384,"Through these general preliminary conceptions the categories are now determined, the more immediate application of which to the history of Philosophy we have now to consider
- HoP 1",181
385,"This application will bring before us the most significant aspects in this history
- HoP 1",90
386,"The development in Time of the various Philosophies
- HoP 1",59
387,"The first question which may be asked in reference to this history, concerns that distinction in regard to the manifestation of the Idea, which has just been noticed
- HoP 1",173
388,"It is the question as to how it happens that Philosophy appears to be a development in time and has a history
- HoP 1",117
389,"The answer to this question encroaches on the metaphysics of Time, and it would be a digression from our object to give here more than the elements on which the answer rests
- HoP 1",181
390,"It has been shown above in reference to the existence of Mind, that its Being is its activity
- HoP 1",101
391,"Nature, on the contrary, is, as it is; its changes are thus only repetitions, and its movements take the form of a circle merely
- HoP 1",136
392,"To express this better, the activity of Mind is to know itself
- HoP 1",70
393,"I am, immediately, but this I am only as a living organism; as Mind I am only in so far as I know myself
- HoP 1",112
394,"Γνῶθι σεαυτόν, Know thyself, the inscription over the temple of the oracle at Delphi, is the absolute command which is expressed by Mind in its essential character
- HoP 1",171
395,"But consciousness really implies that for myself, I am object to myself
- HoP 1",79
396,"In forming this absolute division between what is mine and myself, Mind constitutes its existence and establishes itself as external to itself
- HoP 1",150
397,"It postulates itself in the externality which is just the universal and the distinctive form of existence in Nature
- HoP 1",123
398,"But one of the forms of externality is Time, and this form requires to be further examined both in the Philosophy of Nature and the finite Mind
- HoP 1",151
399,"This Being in existence and therefore Being in time is a moment not only of the individual consciousness, which as such is essentially finite, but also of the development of the philosophical Idea in the element of Thought
- HoP 1",230
400,"For the Idea, thought of as being at rest, is, indeed, not in Time
- HoP 1",74
401,"To think of it as at rest, and to preserve it in the form of immediacy is equivalent to its inward perception
- HoP 1",117
403,"But this element of Thought is itself abstract and is the activity of a single consciousness
- HoP 1",100
405,"Thus Mind’s thinking comprehension of self is at the same time the progression of the total actuality evolved
- HoP 1",117
406,"This progression is not one which takes its course through the thought of an individual and exhibits itself in a single consciousness, for it shows itself to be universal Mind presenting itself in the history of the world in all the richness of its form
- HoP 1",261
407,"The result of this development is that one form, one stage in the Idea comes to consciousness in one particular race, so that this race and this time expresses only this particular form, within which it constructs its universe and works out its conditions
- HoP 1",263
408,"The higher stage, on the other hand, centuries later reveals itself in another race of people
- HoP 1",101
411,"Yet this category is one which anybody can understand; no difficulty is made in regard to it, for it is thoroughly known, and those who use it think they can do so as being entirely comprehensible—as a matter of course they understand what it is
- HoP 1",253
412,"But those who believe the principle of diversity to be one absolutely fixed, do not know its nature, or its dialectic; the manifold or diverse is in a state of flux; it must really be conceived of as in the process of development, and as but a passing moment
- HoP 1",266
413,"Philosophy in its concrete Idea is the activity of development in revealing the differences which it contains within itself; these differences are thoughts, for we are now speaking of development in Thought
- HoP 1",214
414,"In the first place, the differences which rest in the Idea are manifested as thoughts
- HoP 1",93
415,"Secondly, these distinctions must come into existence, one here and the other there; and in order that they may do this, they must be complete, that is, they must contain within themselves the Idea in its totality
- HoP 1",221
416,"The concrete alone as including and supporting the distinctions, is the actual; it is thus, and thus alone, that the differences are in their form entire
- HoP 1",161
417,"A complete form of thought such as is here presented, is a Philosophy
- HoP 1",77
418,"But the Idea contains the distinctions in a peculiar form
- HoP 1",65
420,"But everything hangs on this: these forms are nothing else than the original distinctions in the Idea itself, which is what it is only in them
- HoP 1",150
421,"They are in this way essential to, and constitute the content of the Idea, which in thus sundering itself, attains to form
- HoP 1",130
422,"The manifold character of the principles which appear, is, however, not accidental, but necessary: the different forms constitute an integral part of the whole form
- HoP 1",172
423,"They are the determinations of the original Idea, which together constitute the whole; but as being outside of one another, their union does not take place in them, but in us, the observers
- HoP 1",197
424,"Each system is determined as one, but it is not a permanent condition that the differences are thus mutually exclusive
- HoP 1",126
425,"The inevitable fate of these determinations must follow, and that is that they shall be drawn together and reduced to elements or moments
- HoP 1",145
426,"The independent attitude taken up by each moment is again laid aside
- HoP 1",76
427,"After expansion, contraction follows—the unity out of which they first emerged
- HoP 1",86
428,"This third may itself be but the beginning of a further development
- HoP 1",75
429,"It may seem as if this progression were to go on into infinitude, but it has an absolute end in view, which we shall know better later on; many turnings are necessary, however, before Mind frees itself in coming to consciousness
- HoP 1",236
430,"The temple of self-conscious reason is to be considered from this the point of view alone worthy of the history of Philosophy
- HoP 1",133
431,"It is hence rationally built by an inward master worker, and not in Solomon’s method, as freemasons build
- HoP 1",113
432,"The great assumption that what has taken place on this side, in the world, has also done so in conformity with reason—which is what first gives the history of Philosophy its true interest—is nothing else than trust in Providence, only in another form
- HoP 1",258
433,"As the best of what is in the world is that which Thought produces, it is unreasonable to believe that reason only is in Nature, and not in Mind
- HoP 1",152
434,"That man who believes that what, like the philosophies, belongs to the region of mind must be merely contingent, is insincere in his belief in divine rule, and what he says of it is but empty talk
- HoP 1",204
435,"A long time is undoubtedly required by Mind in working out Philosophy, and when one first reflects on it, the length of the time may seem astonishing, like the immensity of the space spoken of in astronomy
- HoP 1",213
436,"But it must be considered in regard to the slow progress of the world-spirit, that there is no need for it to hasten:—“A thousand years are in Thy sight as one day” It has time enough just because it is itself outside of time, because it is eternal
- HoP 1",256
437,"The fleeting events of the day pass so quickly that there is not time enough for all that has to be done
- HoP 1",112
438,"Who is there who does not die before he has achieved his aims?
- HoP 1",70
439,"The world-spirit has time enough, but that is not all
- HoP 1",61
440,"It is not time alone which has to be made use of in the acquisition of a conception; much else is required
- HoP 1",114
442,"The saying that Nature arrives at its end in the shortest possible way, and that this is right, is a trivial one
- HoP 1",120
443,"The way shown by mind is indirect, and accommodates itself to circumstances
- HoP 1",83
444,"Considerations of finite life, such as time, trouble, and cost, have no place here
- HoP 1",90
445,"In the history of the world progression is slow
- HoP 1",55
446,"The application of the foregoing to the treatment of Philosophy
- HoP 1",71
448,"Contingency must vanish on the appearance of Philosophy
- HoP 1",63
449,"Its history is just as absolutely determined as the development of Notions, and the impelling force is the inner dialectic of the forms
- HoP 1",143
450,"The finite is not true, nor is it what it is to be—its determinate nature is bound up with its existence
- HoP 1",112
451,"But the inward Idea abolishes these finite forms: a philosophy which has not the absolute form identical with the content, must pass away because its form is not that of truth
- HoP 1",183
452,"What follows, secondly from what we have said, is that every philosophy has been and still is necessary
- HoP 1",111
453,"Thus none have passed away, but all are affirmatively contained as elements in a whole
- HoP 1",94
454,"But we must distinguish between the particular principle of these philosophies as particular, and the realization of this principle throughout the whole compass of the world
- HoP 1",181
455,"The principles are retained, the most recent philosophy being the result of all preceding, and hence no philosophy has ever been refuted
- HoP 1",144
456,"What has been refuted is not the principle of this philosophy, but merely the fact that this principle should be considered final and absolute in character
- HoP 1",163
458,"The atomic theory has been refuted, and we are atomists no longer
- HoP 1",73
459,"Mind is certainly explicitly existent as a unit or atom, but that is to attribute to it a barren character and qualities incapable of expressing anything of its depth
- HoP 1",174
460,"The principle is indeed retained, although it is not the absolute in its entirety
- HoP 1",89
461,"This same contradiction appears in all development
- HoP 1",58
462,"The development of the tree is the negation of the germ, and the blossom that of the leaves, in so far as that they show that these do not form the highest and truest existence of the tree
- HoP 1",196
463,"Last of all, the blossom finds its negation in the fruit
- HoP 1",64
464,"Yet none of them can come into actual existence excepting as preceded by all the earlier stages
- HoP 1",103
465,"Our attitude to a philosophy must thus contain an affirmative side and a negative; when we take both of these into consideration, we do justice to a philosophy for the first time
- HoP 1",186
466,"In the third place, we shall limit ourselves to the particular consideration of the principle itself
- HoP 1",108
467,"Each principle has reigned for a certain time, and when the whole system of the world has been explained from this special form, it is called a philosophical system
- HoP 1",172
468,"Its whole theory has certainly to be learned, but as long as the principle is abstract it is not sufficient to embrace the forms belonging to our conception of the world
- HoP 1",177
469,"The Cartesian principles, for instance, are very suitable for application to mechanism, but for nothing further; their representation of other manifestations in the world, such as those of vegetable and animal nature, are insufficient, and hence uninteresting
- HoP 1",267
470,"Therefore we take into consideration the principles of these philosophies only, but in dealing with concrete philosophies we must also regard the chief forms of their development and their applications
- HoP 1",209
471,"The subordinate philosophies are inconsistent; they have had bright glimpses of the truth, which are, however, independent of their principles
- HoP 1",150
472,"This is exemplified in the Timæus of Plato, a philosophy of nature, the working out of which is empirically very barren because its principle does not as yet extend far enough, and it is not to its principle that we owe the deep gleams of thought there contained
- HoP 1",270
473,"In the fourth place it follows that we must not regard the history of Philosophy as dealing with the past, even though it is history
- HoP 1",140
474,"The scientific products of reason form the content of this history, and these are not past
- HoP 1",98
475,"What is obtained in this field of labour is the True, and, as such, the Eternal; it is not what exists now, and not then; it is true not only to-day or to-morrow, but beyond all time, and in as far as it is in time, it is true always and for every time
- HoP 1",260
478,"This forms a continuous awakening
- HoP 1",41
479,"Such work is not only deposited in the temple of Memory as forms of times gone by, but is just as present and as living now as at the time of its production
- HoP 1",164
480,"The effects produced and work performed are not again destroyed or interrupted by what succeeds, for they are such that we must ourselves be present in them
- HoP 1",164
481,"They have as medium neither canvas, paper, marble, nor representation or memorial to preserve them
- HoP 1",106
482,"These mediums are themselves transient, or else form a basis for what is such
- HoP 1",85
483,"But they do have Thought, Notion, and the eternal Being of Mind, which moths cannot corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal
- HoP 1",136
484,"The conquests made by Thought when constituted into Thought form the very Being of Mind
- HoP 1",95
485,"Such knowledge is thus not learning merely, or a knowledge of what is dead, buried and corrupt: the history of Philosophy has not to do with what is gone, but with the living present
- HoP 1",190
486,"We may appropriate to ourselves the whole of the riches apportioned out in time: it must be shown from the succession in philosophies how that succession is the systematization of the science of Philosophy itself
- HoP 1",220
487,"But a distinction is to be noted here: that which first commences is implicit, immediate, abstract, general—it is what has not yet advanced; the more concrete and richer comes later, and the first is poorer in determinations
- HoP 1",232
488,"This may appear contrary to one’s first impressions, but philosophic ideas are often enough directly opposed to ordinary ideas, and what is generally supposed, is not found to be the case
- HoP 1",195
489,"It may be thought that what comes first must be the concrete
- HoP 1",68
490,"The child, for instance, as still in the original totality of his nature, is thought to be more concrete than the man, hence we imagine the latter to be more limited, no longer forming a totality, but living an abstract life
- HoP 1",232
491,"Certainly the man acts in accordance with definite ends, not bringing his whole soul and mind into a subject, but splitting his life into a number of abstract unities
- HoP 1",174
492,"The child and the youth, on the contrary, act straight from the fulness of the heart
- HoP 1",92
493,"Feeling and sense-perception come first, thought last, and thus feeling appears to us to be more concrete than thought, or the activity of abstraction and of the universal
- HoP 1",179
494,"In reality, it is just the other way
- HoP 1",44
495,"The sensuous consciousness is certainly the more concrete, and if poorer in thought, at least richer in content
- HoP 1",119
496,"We must thus distinguish the naturally concrete from the concrete of thought, which on its side, again, is wanting in sensuous matter
- HoP 1",141
497,"The child is also the most abstract and the poorest in thought: as to what pertains to nature, the man is abstract, but in thought he is more concrete than the child
- HoP 1",173
498,"Man’s ends and objects are undoubtedly abstract in general affairs, such as in maintaining his family or performing his business duties, but he contributes to a great objective organic whole, whose progress he advances and directs
- HoP 1",238
499,"In the acts of a child, on the other hand, only a childish and, indeed, momentary “I,” and in those of the youth the subjective constitution or the random aim, form the principle of action
- HoP 1",196
500,"It is in this way that science is more concrete than sense-perception
- HoP 1",77
501,"In applying this to the different forms of Philosophy, it follows in the first place, that the earliest philosophies are the poorest and the most abstract
- HoP 1",162
502,"In them the Idea is least determined; they keep merely to generalities not yet realized
- HoP 1",95
503,"This must be known in order that we may not seek behind the old philosophies for more than we are entitled to find; thus we need not require from them determinations proceeding from a deeper consciousness
- HoP 1",212
504,"For instance, it has been asked whether the philosophy of Thales is, properly speaking, Theism or Atheism,5 whether he asserted a personal God or merely an impersonal, universal existence
- HoP 1",195
505,"The question here regards the attribution of subjectivity to the highest Idea, the conception of the Personality of God
- HoP 1",127
506,"Such subjectivity as we comprehend it, is a much richer, more concentrated, and therefore much later conception, which need not be sought for in distant ages
- HoP 1",165
507,"The Greek gods had, indeed, personality in imagination and idea like the one God of the Jewish religion, but to know what is the mere picture of fancy, and what the insight of pure Thought and Notion, is quite another thing
- HoP 1",231
508,"If we take as basis our own ideas judged by these deeper conceptions, an ancient Philosophy may undoubtedly be spoken of as Atheism
- HoP 1",139
509,"But this expression would at the same time be false, for the thoughts as thoughts in beginning, could not have arrived at the development which we have reached
- HoP 1",167
510,"From this it follows—since the progress of development is equivalent to further determination, and this means further immersion in and a fuller grasp of the Idea itself—that the latest, most modern and newest philosophy is the most developed, richest and deepest
- HoP 1",270
511,"In that philosophy everything which at first seems to be past and gone must be preserved and retained, and it must itself be a mirror of the whole history
- HoP 1",162
512,"The original philosophy is the most abstract, because it is the original and has not as yet made any movement forward; the last, which proceeds from this forward and impelling influence, is the most concrete
- HoP 1",215
514,"It must also be recollected that we must not hesitate to say, what is naturally implied, that the Idea, as comprehended and shown forth in the latest and newest philosophy, is the most developed, the richest and deepest
- HoP 1",227
515,"I call this to remembrance because the designation, new or newest of all in reference to Philosophy, has become a very common by-word
- HoP 1",141
517,"Thus they have the category in which they can place any apparently significant philosophy, and through which they may at the same time set it aside; this they call a fashion-philosophy
- HoP 1",192
519,"It is necessary to set to work on an historical basis, and to ascribe to Philosophy what is immediately given to us, and that alone
- HoP 1",139
521,"Thus in Brucker’s great History of Philosophy (Pt
- HoP 1",57
522,"There are also propositions in support of them and citations taken from discussions of a similar kind with which we may occupy ourselves long enough
- HoP 1",156
523,"Thus, according to Brucker, Thales said, Ex nihilo fit nihil, since he said that water was eternal
- HoP 1",106
524,"Thus, too, he was to be counted amongst the philosophers who deny creation out of nothing; and of this, historically at least, Thales was ignorant
- HoP 1",154
525,"Professor Ritter, too, whose history of Ionic Philosophy is carefully written, and who on the whole is cautious not to introduce foreign matter, has very possibly ascribed to Thales more than is found in history
- HoP 1",219
526,"He regarded the world as the all-embracing, living animal which has developed from a germ like every other animal, and this germ, like that of all other animals, is either damp or water
- HoP 1",193
527,"Thus the fundamental idea of Thales is that the world is a living whole which has developed from a germ and carries on its life as does an animal, by means of nourishment suitable to its nature” (cf
- HoP 1",206
528,"This is quite a different account from that of Aristotle, and none of it is communicated by the ancients regarding Thales
- HoP 1",129
529,"The sequence of thought is evident, but historically it is not justified
- HoP 1",80
531,"The history of Philosophy has simply to deal with this development and bringing forth of thought
- HoP 1",104
532,"The determinations involved certainly follow from a proposition, but whether they are put forth as yet or not is quite another thing, and the bringing forth of the inner content is the only matter of importance
- HoP 1",218
533,"Thus Aristotle states that Thales has defined the principle (ἀρχή) of every thing to be water
- HoP 1",101
534,"But Anaximander first made use of ἀρχή, and Thales thus did not possess this determination of thought at all; he recognized ἀρχή as commencement in time, but not as the fundamental principle
- HoP 1",198
535,"Thales did not once introduce the determination of cause into his philosophy, and first cause is a further determination still
- HoP 1",134
536,"There are whole nations which have not this conception at all; indeed it involves a great step forward in development
- HoP 1",125
537,"And seeing that difference in culture on the whole depends on difference in the thought determinations which are manifested, this must be so still more with respect to philosophies
- HoP 1",188
539,"Its special character is really to be conceived of in accordance with this determination, and it is to be considered with respect to this position in order that full justice may be done to it
- HoP 1",199
540,"On this account nothing more must be demanded or expected from it than what it actually gives, and the satisfaction is not to be sought for in it, which can only be found in a fuller development of knowledge
- HoP 1",215
541,"We must not expect to find the questions of our consciousness and the interest of the present world responded to by the ancients; such questions presuppose a certain development in thought
- HoP 1",196
542,"Therefore every philosophy belongs to its own time and is restricted by its own limitations, just because it is the manifestation of a particular stage in development
- HoP 1",174
544,"How should he escape from this?
- HoP 1",39
545,"It is the same universal Mind that is embraced by thinking Philosophy; that Philosophy is Mind’s thought of itself and therefore its determinate and substantial content
- HoP 1",176
546,"Every philosophy is the philosophy of its own day, a link in the whole chain of spiritual development, and thus it can only find satisfaction for the interests belonging to its own particular time
- HoP 1",204
547,"On this account an earlier philosophy does not give satisfaction to the mind in which a deeper conception reigns
- HoP 1",120
548,"But in the earlier philosophy the Idea is not yet present in this determinate character
- HoP 1",95
549,"Hence the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, and indeed all philosophies, ever live and are present in their principles, but Philosophy no longer has the particular form and aspect possessed by that of Plato and of Aristotle
- HoP 1",232
550,"We cannot rest content with them, and they cannot be revived; hence there can be no Platonists, Aristotelians, Stoics, or Epicureans to-day
- HoP 1",147
551,"To re-awaken them would be to try to bring back to an earlier stage the Mind of a deeper culture and self-penetration
- HoP 1",125
553,"The period of revival in the sciences, the new epoch in learning which took place in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, began not only with the revived study of, but also with the re-animation of the old philosophies
- HoP 1",228
554,"Marsilius Ficinus was a Platonist; an Academy of Platonic philosophy was established and installed with professors by Cosmos de Medici, and Ficinus was placed at the head of it
- HoP 1",184
555,"There were pure Aristotelians like Pomponius: Gassendi later on maintained the Epicurean philosophy, for his philosophy dealt with Physics after the manner of the Epicureans; Lipsius wished to be a Stoic, and so on
- HoP 1",222
556,"The sense of opposition was so great, ancient philosophy and Christianity—from or in which no special philosophy had developed—were so diverse, that no philosophy peculiar to itself could develop in Christianity
- HoP 1",219
557,"But mummies when brought amongst living beings cannot there remain
- HoP 1",74
558,"Mind had for long possessed a more substantial life, a more profound Notion of itself, and hence its thought had higher needs than such as could be satisfied by these philosophies
- HoP 1",187
559,"A revival such as this is then to be regarded only as the transitory period in which we learn to know the forms which are implied and which have gone before, and as the renewal of former struggles through the steps necessary in development
- HoP 1",247
560,"Such reconstructions and repetitions in a distant time of principles which have become foreign to Mind, are in history transitory only, and formed in a language which is dead
- HoP 1",182
561,"Such things are translations only and not originals, and Mind does not find satisfaction excepting in knowledge of its own origination
- HoP 1",142
563,"On the one hand, in this retrogression the desire for an origin and for a fixed point of departure is unmistakable, but such must be sought for in thought and Idea alone and not in an authoritatively given form
- HoP 1",218
566,"Satisfaction is found in them to a certain extent only
- HoP 1",62
567,"Or at least we must know that in such a philosophy there is before us a definite stage in the development of thought, and in it those forms and necessities of Mind which lie within the limits of that stage alone are brought into existence
- HoP 1",246
568,"There slumber in the Mind of modern times ideas more profound which require for their awakening other surroundings and another present than the abstract, dim, grey thought of olden times
- HoP 1",194
569,"In Plato, for instance, questions regarding the nature of freedom, the origin of evil and of sin, providence, &c, do not find their philosophic answer
- HoP 1",158
570,"On such subjects we certainly may in part take the ordinary serious views of the present time, and in part philosophically set their consideration altogether aside, or else consider sin and freedom as something negative only
- HoP 1",232
571,"But neither the one plan nor the other gives freedom to Mind if such subjects have once been explicitly for it, and if the opposition in self-consciousness has given it the power of sinking its interests therein
- HoP 1",219
572,"The case is similar with regard to questions regarding the limits of knowledge, the opposition between subjectivity and objectivity which had not yet come up in Plato’s age
- HoP 1",180
573,"The independence of the “I” within itself and its explicit existence was foreign to him; man had not yet gone back within himself, had not yet set himself forth as explicit
- HoP 1",180
574,"The subject was indeed the individual as free, but as yet he knew himself only as in unity with his Being
- HoP 1",113
575,"The Athenian knew himself to be free, as such, just as the Roman citizen would, as ingenuus
- HoP 1",99
576,"But the fact that man is in and for himself free, in his essence and as man, free born, was known neither by Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, nor the Roman legislators, even though it is this conception alone which forms the source of law
- HoP 1",239
577,"In Christianity the individual, personal mind for the first time becomes of real, infinite and absolute value; God wills that all men shall be saved
- HoP 1",156
578,"It was in the Christian religion that the doctrine was advanced that all men are equal before God, because Christ has set them free with the freedom of Christianity
- HoP 1",172
579,"These principles make freedom independent of any such things as birth, standing or culture
- HoP 1",98
580,"The progress made through them is enormous, but they still come short of this, that to be free constitutes the very idea of man
- HoP 1",135
582,"The History of Philosophy has to represent this science in that form of time and individualities from which its outward form has resulted
- HoP 1",145
583,"Such a representation has, however, to shut out from itself the external history of the time, and to take into account only the general character of the people and time, and likewise their circumstances as a whole
- HoP 1",221
586,"This connection, which is not merely external but essential, has thus two sides, which we must consider
- HoP 1",111
587,"The first is the distinctly historical side, the second is the connection with other matters—the connection of Philosophy with Religion, for instance, by which we at once obtain a deeper conception of Philosophy itself
- HoP 1",226
588,"It is usually said that political affairs and such matters as Religion are to be taken into consideration because they have exercised a great influence on the Philosophy of the time, and similarly it exerts an influence upon them
- HoP 1",237
589,"But when people are content with such a category as “great influence” they place the two in an external relationship, and start from the point of view that both sides are for themselves independent
- HoP 1",205
590,"Here, however, we must think of this relationship in another category, and not according to the influence or effect of one upon the other
- HoP 1",145
591,"The true category is the unity of all these different forms, so that it is one Mind which manifests itself in, and impresses itself upon these different elements
- HoP 1",169
592,"It must be remarked in the first place, that a certain stage is requisite in the intellectual culture of a people in order that it may have a Philosophy at all
- HoP 1",167
593,"Philosophy may thus be called a kind of luxury, in so far as luxury signifies those enjoyments and pursuits which do not belong to external necessity as such
- HoP 1",165
594,"Philosophy in this respect seems more capable of being dispensed with than anything else; but that depends on what is called indispensable
- HoP 1",146
595,"From the point of view of mind, Philosophy may even be said to be that which is most essential
- HoP 1",102
596,"The commencement in History of an intellectual necessity for Philosophy
- HoP 1",79
597,"However much Philosophy, as the thought and conception of the Mind of a particular time, is à priori, it is at the same time just as really a result, since the thought produced and, indeed, the life and action are produced to produce themselves
- HoP 1",252
598,"This activity contains the essential element of a negation, because to produce is also to destroy; Philosophy in producing itself, has the natural as its starting point in order to abrogate it again
- HoP 1",206
599,"Philosophy thus makes its appearance at a time when the Mind of a people has worked its way out of the indifference and stolidity of the first life of nature, as it has also done from the standpoint of the emotional, so that the individual aim has blotted itself out
- HoP 1",274
600,"But as Mind passes on from its natural form, it also proceeds from its exact code of morals and the robustness of life to reflection and conception
- HoP 1",155
601,"The result of this is that it lays hold of and troubles this real, substantial kind of existence, this morality and faith, and thus the period of destruction commences
- HoP 1",175
602,"Further progress is then made through the gathering up of thought within itself
- HoP 1",87
604,"Then it is that Mind takes refuge in the clear space of thought to create for itself a kingdom of thought in opposition to the world of actuality, and Philosophy is the reconciliation following upon the destruction of that real world which thought has begun
- HoP 1",265
605,"When Philosophy with its abstractions paints grey in grey, the freshness and life of youth has gone, the reconciliation is not a reconciliation in the actual, but in the ideal world
- HoP 1",189
606,"Thus the Greek philosophers held themselves far removed from the business of the State and were called by the people idlers, because they withdrew themselves within the world of thought
- HoP 1",193
607,"This holds good throughout all the history of Philosophy
- HoP 1",64
608,"It was so with Ionic Philosophy in the decline of the Ionic States in Asia Minor
- HoP 1",88
609,"Socrates and Plato had no more pleasure in the life of the State in Athens, which was in the course of its decline; Plato tried to bring about something better with Dionysius
- HoP 1",182
610,"Thus in Athens, with the ruin of the Athenian people, the period was reached when Philosophy appeared
- HoP 1",109
612,"With the decline of the Roman Empire, which was so great, rich and glorious, and yet inwardly dead, the height and indeed the zenith of ancient Philosophy is associated through the Neo-Platonists at Alexandria
- HoP 1",217
613,"It was also in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, when the Teutonic life of the Middle Ages acquired another form, that Philosophy first became taught, though it was later on that it attained to independence
- HoP 1",219
614,"Before that, political life still existed in unity with Religion, or if the State fought against the Church, the Church still kept the foremost place, but now the gulf between Church and State came into existence
- HoP 1",220
615,"Philosophy thus comes in at a certain epoch only in the development of the whole
- HoP 1",88
618,"Mind in each case has elaborated and expanded in the whole domain of its manifold nature the principle of the particular stage of self-consciousness to which it has attained
- HoP 1",181
619,"Thus the Mind of a people in its richness is an organization, and, like a Cathedral, is divided into numerous vaults, passages, pillars and vestibules, all of which have proceeded out of one whole and are directed to one end
- HoP 1",232
620,"Philosophy is one form of these many aspects
- HoP 1",52
621,"And which is it?
- HoP 1",24
622,"It is the fullest blossom, the Notion of Mind in its entire form, the consciousness and spiritual essence of all things, the spirit of the time as spirit present in itself
- HoP 1",179
623,"The multifarious whole is reflected in it as in the single focus, in the Notion which knows itself
- HoP 1",106
624,"The Philosophy which is essential within Christianity could not be found in Rome, for all the various forms of the whole are only the expression of one and the same determinate character
- HoP 1",194
625,"Hence political history, forms of government, art and religion are not related to Philosophy as its causes, nor, on the other hand, is Philosophy the ground of their existence—one and all have the same common root, the spirit of the time
- HoP 1",245
627,"This particular stage is the product of the one preceding
- HoP 1",65
628,"But to show how the spirit of a particular time moulds its whole actuality and destiny in accordance with its principle, to show this whole edifice in its conception, is far from us—for that would be the object of the whole philosophic world-history
- HoP 1",257
629,"Those forms alone concern us which express the principle of the Mind in a spiritual element related to Philosophy
- HoP 1",121
630,"This is the position of Philosophy amongst its varying forms, from which it follows that it is entirely identical with its time
- HoP 1",135
631,"But if Philosophy does not stand above its time in content, it does so in form, because, as the thought and knowledge of that which is the substantial spirit of its time, it makes that spirit its object
- HoP 1",210
632,"In as far as Philosophy is in the spirit of its time, the latter is its determined content in the world, although as knowledge, Philosophy is above it, since it places it in the relation of object
- HoP 1",204
633,"But this is in form alone, for Philosophy really has no other content
- HoP 1",77
634,"This knowledge itself undoubtedly is the actuality of Mind, the self-knowledge of Mind which previously was not present: thus the formal difference is also a real and actual difference
- HoP 1",192
635,"Through knowledge, Mind makes manifest a distinction between knowledge and that which is; this knowledge is thus what produces a new form of development
- HoP 1",160
636,"The new forms at first are only special modes of knowledge, and it is thus that a new Philosophy is produced: yet since it already is a wider kind of spirit, it is the inward birthplace of the spirit which will later arrive at actual form
- HoP 1",246
637,"The history of the other Sciences, of culture and above all the history of art and of religion are, partly in regard to the elements contained in them, and partly to their particular objects, related to the history of Philosophy
- HoP 1",236
638,"It is through this relationship that the treatment of the history of Philosophy has been so confused
- HoP 1",108
640,"This is so, partly on account of the amount of material itself and the labour required in working it up and preparing it, and partly because it is in immediate connection with so much else
- HoP 1",196
641,"But the separation must not be made arbitrarily or as by chance, but must be derived from fundamental determinations
- HoP 1",124
642,"If we merely look at the name of Philosophy, all this matter will pertain to its history
- HoP 1",96
643,"I shall speak of this material from three points of view, for three related aspects are to be eliminated and separated from Philosophy
- HoP 1",142
644,"The first of these is that which is generally considered to be the domain of science, and in which are found the beginnings of understanding thought
- HoP 1",156
645,"The second region is that of mythology and religion; the relation of Philosophy to them seems often to be inimical both in the time of the Greeks and of the Christians
- HoP 1",175
646,"The third is that of philosophizing and the metaphysics of the understanding
- HoP 1",84
647,"Relation of Philosophy to Scientific Knowledge
- HoP 1",54
648,"Knowledge and thought certainly form the element of whatever has to do with particular sciences as they form the element of Philosophy; but their subjects are mainly finite subjects and appearance
- HoP 1",204
649,"A collection of facts known about this content is by its nature excluded from Philosophy: neither this content nor such a form has anything to do with it
- HoP 1",161
650,"But even if the sciences are systematic and contain universal principles and laws from which they proceed, they are still related to a limited circle of objects
- HoP 1",168
651,"The ultimate principles are assumed as are the objects themselves; that is, the outward experience or the feelings of the heart, natural or educated sense of right and duty, constitute the source from which they are created
- HoP 1",231
652,"Logic and the determinations and principles of thought in general are in their methods assumed
- HoP 1",102
653,"The forms of thought or the points of view and principles which hold good in the sciences and constitute the ultimate support of all their matter, are not peculiar to them, but are common to the condition and culture of the time and of the people
- HoP 1",254
654,"This culture consists mainly in the general ideas and aims, in the whole extent of the particular intellectual powers dominating consciousness and life
- HoP 1",159
655,"Our consciousness has these ideas and allows them to be considered ultimate determinations; it makes use of them as guiding and connecting links, but does not know them and does not even make them the objects of its consideration
- HoP 1",237
656,"To give an abstract example, each act of consciousness has and requires the whole abstract thought-determination of Being
- HoP 1",129
657,"Again, in a higher culture, such relations as those of cause and effect are involved, as also those of force and its manifestation
- HoP 1",138
658,"All its knowledge and ideas are permeated and governed by a metaphysic such as this; it is the net in which all the concrete matter which occupies mankind in action and in impulses, is grasped
- HoP 1",200
659,"But this web and its knots in our ordinary consciousness are sunk into a manifold material, for it contains the objects and interests which we know and which we have before us
- HoP 1",183
660,"These common threads are not drawn up and made explicitly the objects of our reflection
- HoP 1",95
661,"And yet traces of this are found, as for instance, in the fact that the philosophic Faculty contains all the Sciences which have not as their immediate aim the Church and State
- HoP 1",184
662,"In connection with this, the significance of the name of Philosophy, which is even now an important matter of discussion in England, comes in question
- HoP 1",158
663,"Natural Sciences are in England called Philosophy
- HoP 1",57
664,"A “Philosophic Journal” in England, edited by Thompson, treats of Chemistry, Agriculture, Manuring, Husbandry, Technology, like Hermbstädt’s Journal, and gives inventions connected therewith
- HoP 1",198
665,"The English call physical instruments, such as the barometer and thermometer, philosophical instruments
- HoP 1",111
666,"Theories too, and especially morality and the moral sciences, which are derived from the feelings of the human heart or from experience, are called Philosophy, and finally this is also so with the theories and principles of Political Economy
- HoP 1",249
667,"And thus at least in England, is the name of Philosophy respected
- HoP 1",73
668,"Some time ago a banquet took place under the presidency of Lord Liverpool, at which the minister Canning was also present
- HoP 1",129
669,"The latter in returning thanks congratulated England in having philosophic principles of government there brought into operation
- HoP 1",136
670,"There, at least, Philosophy is no by-word
- HoP 1",49
671,"In the first beginnings of culture, however, we are more often met by this admixture of Philosophy and general knowledge
- HoP 1",128
672,"There comes a time to a nation when mind applies itself to universal objects, when, for example, in seeking to bring natural things under general modes of understanding, it tries to learn their causes
- HoP 1",208
673,"Then it is said that a people begins to philosophize, for this content has thought in common with Philosophy
- HoP 1",116
674,"At such a time we find deliverances about all the common events of Nature, as we also find intellectual maxims, moral sentences, general principles respecting morality, the will, duty, and the like, and those who expressed them have been called wise men or philosophers
- HoP 1",277
675,"Thus in the beginnings of Greek Philosophy we find the seven sages and the Ionic Philosophers
- HoP 1",101
676,"From them a number of ideas and discoveries are conveyed to us which seem like philosophic propositions
- HoP 1",111
677,"Thus Thales, amongst others, has explained that the eclipse of sun and moon is due to the intervention of the moon or earth

- HoP 1",67
680,"Others have had ideas about the stars: the heavens were supposed to be composed of perforated metal, by which we see throughout the empyrean region, the eternal fire which surrounds the world
- HoP 1",199
681,"Such propositions as products of the understanding, do not belong to the history of Philosophy, although they imply that the merely sensuous gaze has been left behind, as also the representation of those objects by the imagination only
- HoP 1",243
682,"Earth and heaven thus become unpeopled with gods, because the understanding distinguishes things in their outward and natural qualities from Mind
- HoP 1",153
683,"In a later time the epoch of the revival in the sciences is as noteworthy in this respect
- HoP 1",97
684,"General principles regarding the state, &c, were given expression to, and in them a philosophic side cannot be mistaken
- HoP 1",127
685,"To this place the philosophic systems of Hobbes and Descartes belong: the writings of the latter contain philosophic principles, but his Philosophy of Nature is quite empirical
- HoP 1",184
686,"Hugo Grotius composed an international law in which what was historically held by the people as law, the consensus gentium, was a main element

- HoP 1",195
690,"However much this may seem to be contrary to the principle of Philosophy, it has in common with it the fact that the bases of both are universal, and still further that I have made this experience, that it rests on my consciousness and obtains its significance through me

694,"Similarly this principle has turned against the recognized constitutions and has sought different principles instead, by them to correct the former
- HoP 1",155
695,"Universal principles of the State have now been laid down, while earlier, because religion was positive, the ground of obedience of subjects to princes and of all authority were also so
- HoP 1",193
696,"Kings, as the anointed of the Lord, in the sense that Jewish kings were so, derived their power from God, and had to give account to Him alone, because all authority is given by God
- HoP 1",189
697,"So far theology and jurisprudence were on the whole fixed and positive sciences, wherever this positive character might have been derived
- HoP 1",145
698,"Against this external authority reflection has been brought to bear, and thus, especially in England, the source of public and civil law became no longer mere authority derived from God like the Mosaic Law
- HoP 1",213
699,"For the authority of kings other justification was sought, such as the end implied in the State, the good of the people
- HoP 1",127
700,"This forms quite another source of truth, and it is opposed to that which is revealed, given and positive
- HoP 1",113
701,"This substitution of another ground than that of authority has been called philosophizing
- HoP 1",97
702,"The knowledge was then a knowledge of what is finite—the world of the content of knowledge
- HoP 1",98
703,"Because this content proceeded through the personal insight of human reason, man has become independent in his actions
- HoP 1",126
704,"This independence of the Mind is the true moment of Philosophy, although the Notion of Philosophy through this formal determination, which limits it to finite objects, has not yet been exhausted
- HoP 1",202
705,"This independent thought is respected, has been called human wisdom or worldly wisdom, for it has had what is earthly as its object, and it took its origin in the world
- HoP 1",176
706,"This was the meaning of Philosophy, and men did rightly to call it worldly wisdom
- HoP 1",89
707,"Frederick von Schlegel revived this by-name for Philosophy, and desired to indicate by it that what concerns higher spheres, such as religion, must be kept apart; and he had many followers
- HoP 1",196
708,"Philosophy, indeed, occupies itself with finite things, but, according to Spinoza, as resting in the divine Idea: it has thus the same end as religion
- HoP 1",158
709,"To the finite sciences which are now separated also from Philosophy, the Churches objected that they led men away from God, since they have as objects only what is finite
- HoP 1",178
710,"This defect in them, conceived of from the point of view of content, leads us to the second department allied to Philosophy,—that is, to Religion
- HoP 1",153
711,"Relation of Philosophy to Religion
- HoP 1",42
712,"As the first department of knowledge was related to Philosophy principally by means of formal and independent knowledge, Religion, though in its content quite different from this first kind or sphere of knowledge, is through it related to Philosophy
- HoP 1",257
713,"Its object is not the earthly and worldly, but the infinite
- HoP 1",67
714,"In the case of art and still more in that of Religion, Philosophy has in common a content composed entirely of universal objects; they constitute the mode in which the highest Idea is existent for the unphilosophical feeling, the perceiving and imagining consciousness
- HoP 1",276
716,"In Religion, races of men have undoubtedly expressed their idea of the nature of the world, the substance of nature and of intellect and the relation of man thereto
- HoP 1",172
717,"Absolute Being is here the object of their consciousness; and as such, is for them pre-eminently the “other,” a “beyond,” nearer or further off, more or less friendly or frightful and alarming
- HoP 1",200
718,"In the act and forms of worship this opposition is removed by man, and he raises himself to the consciousness of unity with his Being, to the feeling of, or dependence on, the Grace of God, in that God has reconciled mankind to Himself
- HoP 1",243
719,"In conception, with the Greeks, for instance, this existence is to man one which is already in and for itself and friendly, and thus worship is but the enjoyment of this unity
- HoP 1",183
721,"Such ideas as that priests have framed a people’s Religion in fraud and self-interest are consequently absurd; to regard Religion as an arbitrary matter or a deception is as foolish as it is perverted
- HoP 1",208
722,"Priests have often profaned Religion—the possibility of which is a consequence of the external relations and temporal existence of Religion
- HoP 1",147
723,"It can thus, in this external connection, be laid hold of here and there, but because it is Religion, it is really that which stands firm against finite ends and their complications and constitutes a region exalted high above them
- HoP 1",238
724,"This region of Mind is really the Holy place of Truth itself, the Holy place in which are dissolved the remaining illusions of the sensuous world, of finite ideas and ends, and of the sphere of opinion and caprice
- HoP 1",221
725,"Inasmuch as it really is the content of religions, this rational matter might now seem to be capable of being abstracted and expressed as a number of historical theorems
- HoP 1",177
726,"Philosophy stands on the same basis as Religion and has the same object—the universal reason existing in and for itself; Mind desires to make this object its own, as is done with Religion in the act and form of worship
- HoP 1",226
727,"But the form, as it is present in Religion, is different from what is found to be contained in Philosophy, and on this account a history of Philosophy is different from a history of Religion
- HoP 1",198
728,"Philosophy is related in the form of thinking consciousness to its object; with Religion it is different
- HoP 1",112
729,"But the distinction between the two should not be conceived of so abstractly as to make it seem that thought is only in Philosophy and not in Religion
- HoP 1",158
730,"The latter has likewise ideas and universal thoughts
- HoP 1",60
731,"Because both are so nearly related, it is an old tradition in the history of Philosophy to deduce Philosophy from Persian, Indian, or similar philosophy, a custom which is still partly retained in all histories of Philosophy
- HoP 1",232
732,"For this reason, too, it is a legend universally believed, that Pythagoras, for instance, received his Philosophy from India and Egypt; the fame of the wisdom of these people, which wisdom is understood also to contain Philosophy, is an old one
- HoP 1",252
736,"In the Persian and Indian Religions very deep, sublime and speculative thoughts are even expressed
- HoP 1",106
737,"Indeed, in Religion we even meet philosophies directly expressed, as in the Philosophy of the Fathers
- HoP 1",109
738,"The scholastic Philosophy really was Theology; there is found in it a union or, if you will, a mixture of Theology and Philosophy which may very well puzzle us
- HoP 1",167
739,"The question which confronts us on the one side is, how Philosophy differs from Theology, as the science of Religion, or from Religion as consciousness?
- HoP 1",160
740,"And then, in how far have we in the history of Philosophy to take account of what pertains to Religion?
- HoP 1",111
742,"Difference between Philosophy and Religion
- HoP 1",50
743,"The consideration of the mythical aspect of Religion or the historical and positive side generally, is interesting, because from it the difference in respect of form will show in what this content is antagonistic to Philosophy
- HoP 1",234
744,"Indeed, taken in its connections, its difference passes into apparent inconsistency
- HoP 1",91
745,"This diversity is not only found in our contemplation but forms a very definite element in history
- HoP 1",106
746,"It is required by Philosophy that it should justify its beginning and its manner of knowledge, and Philosophy has thus placed itself in opposition to Religion
- HoP 1",166
747,"On the other hand Philosophy is combated and condemned by Religion and by the Churches
- HoP 1",94
748,"The Greek popular religion indeed, proscribed several philosophers; but the opposition is even more apparent in the Christian Church
- HoP 1",140
749,"The question is thus not only whether regard is to be paid to Religion in the history of Philosophy, for it has been the case that Philosophy has paid attention to Religion, and the latter to the former
- HoP 1",210
750,"Since neither of the two has allowed the other to rest undisturbed, we are not permitted to do so either
- HoP 1",112
751,"Of their relations, therefore, we must speak definitely, openly and honestly—aborder la question, as the French say
- HoP 1",123
752,"We must not seem to wish to leave Religion alone
- HoP 1",56
753,"This is nothing else than to appear to wish to conceal the fact that Philosophy has directed its efforts against Religion
- HoP 1",129
754,"Religion, that is, the theologians, are indeed the cause of this; they ignore Philosophy, but only in order that they may not be contradicted in their arbitrary reasoning
- HoP 1",178
755,"It may appear as if Religion demanded that man should abstain from thinking of universal matters and Philosophy because they are merely worldly wisdom and represent human operations
- HoP 1",189
756,"Human reason is here opposed to the divine
- HoP 1",50
759,"Thus what is external and accidental is regarded as emphatically the work of God, and what has its root in will and conscience, as the work of man
- HoP 1",154
761,"But if the summit of everything is found in this, that God rules over Nature, what then is free-will?
- HoP 1",109
762,"Does He not rule over what is spiritual, or rather since He himself is spiritual, in what is spiritual?
- HoP 1",111
763,"But is that admiration of God as revealed in natural things as such, in trees and animals as opposed to what is human, far removed from the religion of the ancient Egyptians, which derived its knowledge of what is divine from the ibis, or from cats and dogs?
- HoP 1",266
764,"It seems to be expressed by such a view that human action as regards Nature is ungodly; that the operations of Nature are divine operations, but what man produces is ungodly
- HoP 1",181
765,"But the productions of human reason might, at least, be esteemed as much as Nature
- HoP 1",90
766,"In so doing, however, we cede less to reason than is permitted to us
- HoP 1",76
767,"If the life and the action of animals be divine, human action must stand much higher, and must be worthy to be called divine in an infinitely higher sense
- HoP 1",162
768,"The preeminence of human thought must forthwith be avowed
- HoP 1",65
769,"Christ says on this subject (Matt
- HoP 1",41
771,"Spirit is infinitely high above Nature, in it the Divine Nature manifests itself more than in Nature
- HoP 1",108
772,"But the form in which the universal content which is in and for itself, first belongs to Philosophy is the form of Thought, the form of the universal itself
- HoP 1",164
773,"In Religion, however, this content is for immediate and outward perception, and further for idea and sensation through art
- HoP 1",130
774,"The import is for the sensuous nature; it is the evidence of the Mind which comprehends that content
- HoP 1",108
775,"To make this clearer, the difference must be recollected between that which we are and have, and how we know the same—that is, in what manner we know it and have it as our object
- HoP 1",186
776,"This distinction is an infinitely important matter, and it alone is concerned in the culture of races and of individuals
- HoP 1",128
777,"We are men and have reason; what is human, or above all, what is rational vibrates within us, both in our feelings, mind and heart and in our subjective nature generally
- HoP 1",177
778,"It is in this corresponding vibration and in the corresponding motion effected that a particular content becomes our own and is like our own
- HoP 1",148
779,"The manifold nature of the determinations which it contains is concentrated and wrapt up within this inward nature—an obscure motion of Mind in itself and in universal substantiality
- HoP 1",190
780,"The content is thus directly identical with the simple abstract certainty of ourselves and with self-consciousness
- HoP 1",122
781,"But Mind, because it is Mind, is as truly consciousness
- HoP 1",63
782,"What is confined within itself in its simplicity must be objective to itself and must come to be known
- HoP 1",110
783,"The whole difference lies in the manner and method of this objectivity, and hence in the manner and method of consciousness
- HoP 1",131
784,"This method and manner extends from the simple expression of the dulness of mere feeling to the most objective form, to that which is in and for itself objective, to Thought
- HoP 1",181
785,"The most simple, most formal objectivity is the expression of a name for that feeling and for the state of mind according with it, as seen in these words, worship, prayer, etc Such expressions as “Let us pray” and “Let us worship” are simply the recalling of that feeling
- HoP 1",279
787,"This object, however, comprehending in itself the whole substantial content, is itself still undeveloped and entirely undetermined
- HoP 1",138
788,"To develop that content, to comprehend, express and bring to consciousness its relations, is the commencement, creation and manifestation of Religion
- HoP 1",157
789,"The form in which this developed content first possesses objectivity is that of immediate perception, of sensuous idea or of a more defined idea deduced from natural, physical or mental manifestations and conditions
- HoP 1",223
790,"Art brings about this consciousness, in that it gives permanence and cohesion to the fleeting visible appearance through which objectivity passes in sensation
- HoP 1",166
791,"The shapeless, sacred stone, the mere place, or whatever it is to which the desire for objectivity first attaches itself, receives from art, form, feature, determinate character and content which can be known and which is now present for consciousness
- HoP 1",259
792,"Art has thus become the instructress of the people
- HoP 1",58
794,"The consciousness of this Religion is rather the product of thinking imagination, or of thought which comprehends through the organ of imagination alone and finds expression in its forms
- HoP 1",194
795,"If the infinite Thought, the absolute Mind, has revealed and does reveal itself in true Religion, that in which it reveals itself is the heart, the representing consciousness and the understanding of what is finite
- HoP 1",222
796,"Religion is not merely directed to every sort of culture
- HoP 1",64
799,"To make this clearer, something must be said as to what is the meaning of comprehension
- HoP 1",95
800,"On the one hand, as has been remarked above, there is in it the substantial basis of content, which, coming to Mind as its absolute Being, affects it in its innermost, finds an answering chord, and thereby obtains from it confirmation
- HoP 1",242
801,"This is the first absolute condition necessary to comprehension; what is not implicitly there cannot come within it or be for it—that is, a content which is infinite and eternal
- HoP 1",185
802,"For the substantial as infinite, is just that which has no limitations in that to which it is related, for else it would be limited and not the true substantial
- HoP 1",168
803,"And Mind is that alone which is not implicit, which is finite and external; for what is finite and external is no longer what is implicit but what is for another, what has entered into a relation
- HoP 1",203
804,"But, on the other hand, because the true and eternal must be for Mind become known, that is, enter into finite consciousness, the Mind for which it is, is finite and the manner of its consciousness consists in the ideas and forms of finite things and relations
- HoP 1",268
806,"The assertion of Religion is that the manifestation of Truth which is revealed to us through it, is one which is given to man from outside, and on this account it is also asserted that man has humbly to assent to it, because human reason cannot attain to it by itself
- HoP 1",275
807,"The assertion of positive Religion is that its truths exist without having their source known, so that the content as given, is one which is above and beyond reason
- HoP 1",172
808,"By means of some prophet or other divine instrument, the truth is made known: just as Ceres and Triptolemus who introduced agriculture and matrimony, for so doing were honoured by the Greeks, men have rendered thanks to Moses and to Mahomed
- HoP 1",248
809,"Through whatever individual the Truth may have been given, the external matter is historical, and this is indifferent to the absolute content and to itself, since the person is not the import of the doctrine
- HoP 1",215
810,"But the Christian Religion has this characteristic that the Person of Christ in His character of the Son of God, Himself partakes of the nature of God
- HoP 1",158
811,"If Christ be for Christians only a teacher like Pythagoras, Socrates or Columbus, there would be here no universal divine content, no revelation or knowledge imparted about the Nature of God, and it is regarding this alone that we desire to obtain knowledge
- HoP 1",265
812,"But there is the further fact, that neither in Religion nor in Philosophy does this external form remain, nor can it so remain
- HoP 1",134
813,"A form of the imagination or an historical form, such as Christ, must for the spirit be spiritual; and thus it ceases to be an external matter, seeing that the form of externality is dead
- HoP 1",195
814,"The relation borne by the human spirit to this Spirit involves the following considerations
- HoP 1",99
815,"Spirit in itself is merely this comprehension of itself
- HoP 1",63
816,"There is only one Spirit, the universal divine Spirit
- HoP 1",61
818,"As universal, it is object to itself, and thus determined as a particular, it is this individual: but as universal it reaches over this its “other,” so that its “other” and itself are comprised in one
- HoP 1",208
819,"The true universality seems, popularly expressed, to be two—what is common to the universal itself and to the particular
- HoP 1",128
820,"A division is formed in the understanding of itself, and the Spirit is the unity of what is understood and the understanding person
- HoP 1",139
821,"The divine Spirit which is comprehended, is objective; the subjective Spirit comprehends
- HoP 1",96
822,"But Spirit is not passive, or else the passivity can be momentary only; there is one spiritual substantial unity
- HoP 1",120
823,"The subjective Spirit is the active, but the objective Spirit is itself this activity; the active subjective Spirit is that which comprehends the divine, and in its comprehension of it it is itself the divine Spirit
- HoP 1",223
824,"The relation of Spirit to self alone is the absolute determination; the divine Spirit lives in its own communion and presence
- HoP 1",133
825,"This comprehension has been called Faith, but it is not an historical faith; we Lutherans—I am a Lutheran and will remain the same—have only this original faith
- HoP 1",168
826,"This unity is not the Substance of Spinoza, but the apprehending Substance in self-consciousness which makes itself eternal and relates to universality
- HoP 1",159
827,"The talk about the limitations of human thought is futile; to know God is the only end of Religion
- HoP 1",106
828,"The testimony of the Spirit to the content of Religion is itself Religion; it is a testimony that both bears witness and at the same time is that witness
- HoP 1",161
829,"The Spirit proves itself, and does so first in the proof; it is only proved because it proves itself and shows or manifests itself
- HoP 1",138
831,"This permeating and permeated Spirit now enters into conception; God goes forth into the “other” and makes Himself objective
- HoP 1",132
832,"All that pertains to revelation and its reception, and which comes before us in mythology, here appears; everything which is historical and which belongs to what is positive has here its proper place
- HoP 1",207
833,"To speak more definitely, we now have the Christ who came into the world nearly two thousand years ago
- HoP 1",110
835,"The two stages have here been given, the first of which is the stage of devotion, of worship, such as that reached in partaking of the Communion
- HoP 1",152
836,"That is the perception of the divine Spirit in the community in which the present, indwelling, living Christ as self-consciousness has attained to actuality
- HoP 1",164
837,"The second stage is that of developed consciousness, when the content becomes the object; here this present, indwelling Christ retreats two thousand years to a small corner of Palestine, and is an individual historically manifested far away at Nazareth or Jerusalem
- HoP 1",273
838,"It is the same thing in the Greek Religion where the god present in devotion changes into prosaic statues and marble; or in painting, where this externality is likewise arrived at, when the god becomes mere canvas or wood
- HoP 1",229
839,"The Supper is, according to the Lutheran conception, of Faith alone; it is a divine satisfaction, and is not adored as if it were the Host
- HoP 1",146
840,"Thus a sacred image is no more to us than is a stone or thing
- HoP 1",69
841,"The second point of view must indeed be that with which consciousness begins; it must start from the external comprehension of this form: it must passively accept report and take it up into memory
- HoP 1",204
842,"But if it remain where it is, that is the unspiritual point of view; to remain fixed in this second standpoint in this dead far-away historic distance, is to reject the Spirit
- HoP 1",183
843,"The sins of him who lies against the Holy Ghost cannot be forgiven
- HoP 1",74
845,"The man who speaks of the merely finite, of merely human reason, and of the limits to mere reason, lies against the Spirit, for the Spirit as infinite and universal, as self-comprehension, comprehends itself not in a “merely” nor in limits, nor in the finite as such
- HoP 1",274
846,"It has nothing to do with this, for it comprehends itself within itself alone, in its infinitude
- HoP 1",104
847,"If it be said of Philosophy that it makes reality the subject of its knowledge, the principal point is that the reality should not be one outside of that of which it is the reality
- HoP 1",188
848,"For example, if from the real content of a book, I abstract the binding, paper, ink, language, the many thousand letters that are contained in it, the simple universal content as reality, is not outside of the book
- HoP 1",222
849,"Similarly law is not outside of the individual, but it constitutes the true Being of the individual
- HoP 1",107
850,"The reality of my Mind is thus in my Mind itself and not outside of it; it is my real Being, my own substance, without which I am without existence
- HoP 1",155
851,"This reality is, so to speak, the combustible material which may be kindled and lit up by the universal reality as such as objective; and only so far as this phosphorus is in men, is comprehension, the kindling and lighting up, possible
- HoP 1",244
852,"Feeling, anticipation, knowledge of God, are only thus in men; without such, the divine Mind would not be the in and for itself Universal
- HoP 1",145
854,"Since reality is itself Spirit and not an abstraction, “God is not a God for the dead but for the living,” and indeed for living spirits
- HoP 1",144
855,"The great Creator was alone   And experienced desire,   Therefore He created Spirits,   Holy mirrors of His holiness
- HoP 1",124
856,"The noblest Being He found no equal;   From out the bowl of all the spiritual world,   There sparkled up to Him infinitude
- HoP 1",130
857,"Religion is also the point of view from which this existence is known
- HoP 1",77
858,"But as regards the different forms of knowledge existing in Religion and Philosophy, Philosophy appears to be opposed to the conception in Religion that the universal mind first shows itself as external, in the objective mode of consciousness
- HoP 1",250
859,"Worship, commencing with the external, then turns against and abrogates it as has just been said, and thus Philosophy is justified through the acts and forms of worship, and only does what they do
- HoP 1",204
860,"Philosophy has to deal with two different objects; first as in the Religion present in worship, with the substantial content, the spiritual soul, and secondly with bringing this before consciousness as object, but in the form of thought
- HoP 1",244
861,"Philosophy thinks and conceives of that which Religion represents as the object of consciousness, whether it is as the work of the imagination or as existent facts in history
- HoP 1",182
862,"The form of the knowledge of the object is, in religious consciousness, such as pertains to the ordinary idea, and is thus more or less sensuous in nature
- HoP 1",162
863,"In Philosophy we do not say that God begot a Son, which is a relation derived from natural life
- HoP 1",103
864,"Thought, or the substance of such a relation, is therefore still recognized in Philosophy
- HoP 1",97
865,"Since Philosophy thinks its object, it has the advantage of uniting the two stages of religious consciousness—which in Religion are different moments—into one unity in philosophic thought
- HoP 1",195
867,"The first stage in the order of manifestation is definite existence, or a determinate Being-for-self as opposed to the other
- HoP 1",132
868,"The later form is that Thought embraces itself in the concrete, immerses itself in itself, and Mind, as such, comes in it to consciousness
- HoP 1",146
869,"In the earlier stage, Mind is abstract, and in this constraint it knows itself to be different, and in opposition to the other
- HoP 1",134
871,"Generally speaking, the course of this antithesis in history is that Thought first of all comes forth within Religion, as not free and in separate manifestations
- HoP 1",169
872,"Secondly, it strengthens itself, feels itself to be resting upon itself, holds and conducts itself inimically towards the other form, and does not recognize itself therein
- HoP 1",179
873,"In the third place, it concludes by acknowledging itself as in this other
- HoP 1",81
877,"Thus the ancient Greek philosophers generally respected the popular religion, or at least they did not oppose it, or reflect upon it
- HoP 1",140
878,"Those coming later, including even Xenophanes, handled popular ideas most severely, and thus many so-called atheists made their appearance
- HoP 1",146
881,"Plato declaimed against the poets and their gods
- HoP 1",56
884,"Latest of all Philosophy permits full justice to be done to the content of Religion through the speculative Notion, which is through Thought itself
- HoP 1",155
885,"For this end the Notion must have grasped itself in the concrete and penetrated to concrete spirituality
- HoP 1",112
886,"This must be the standpoint of the Philosophy of the present time; it has begun within Christianity and can have no other content than the world-spirit
- HoP 1",159
887,"When that spirit comprehends itself in Philosophy, it also comprehends itself in that form which formerly was inimical to Philosophy
- HoP 1",140
888,"Thus Religion has a content in common with Philosophy the forms alone being different; and the only essential point is that the form of the Notion should be so far perfected as to be able to grasp the content of Religion
- HoP 1",228
889,"The Truth is just that which has been called the mysteries of Religion
- HoP 1",78
890,"These constitute the speculative element in Religion such as were called by the Neo-platonists μυεῖν, μυεῖσθαι (being initiated), or being occupied with speculative Notions
- HoP 1",180
891,"By mysteries is meant, superficially speaking, the secret, what remains such and does not arrive at being known
- HoP 1",119
892,"But in the Eleusinian mysteries there was nothing unknown; all Athenians were initiated into them, Socrates alone shut himself out
- HoP 1",138
893,"Openly to make them known to strangers was the one thing forbidden, as indeed it was made a crime in the case of certain people
- HoP 1",135
894,"Such matters however, as being holy, were not to be spoken of
- HoP 1",69
895,"Herodotus often expressly says (eg ii
- HoP 1",45
896,"In the Christian Religion dogmas are called mysteries
- HoP 1",61
897,"They are that which man knows about the Nature of God
- HoP 1",61
898,"Neither is there anything mysterious in this; it is known by all those who are partakers in that Religion, and these are thus distinguished from the followers of other Religions
- HoP 1",185
899,"Hence mystery here signifies nothing unknown, since all Christians are in the secret
- HoP 1",92
900,"Mysteries are in their nature speculative, mysterious certainly to the understanding, but not to reason; they are rational, just in the sense of being speculative
- HoP 1",170
901,"The understanding does not comprehend the speculative which simply is the concrete because it holds to the differences in their separation; their contradiction is indeed contained in the mystery, which, however, is likewise the resolution of the same
- HoP 1",258
903,"When the understanding which does not comprehend the truths of Religion, calls itself the illuminating reason and plays the lord and master, it goes astray
- HoP 1",163
904,"Rationalism is opposed to Philosophy in content and form, for it has made the content empty as it has made the heavens, and has reduced all that is, to finite relations—in its form it is a reasoning process which is not free and which has no conceiving power
- HoP 1",266
905,"The supernatural in Religion is opposed to rationalism, and if indeed the latter is related in respect of the real content to Philosophy, yet it differs from it in form, for it has become unspiritual and wooden, looking for its justification to mere external authority
- HoP 1",276
906,"The scholastics were not supernaturalists in this sense; they knew the dogmas of the Church in thought and in conception
- HoP 1",128
907,"If Religion in the inflexibility of its abstract authority as opposed to thought, declares of it that “the gates of Hell shall not triumph over it,” the gates of reason are stronger than the gates of Hell, not to overcome the Church but to reconcile itself to the Church
- HoP 1",278
908,"Philosophy, as the conceiving thought of this content, has as regards the idea of Religion, the advantage of comprehending both sides—it comprehends Religion and also comprehends both rationalism and supernaturalism and itself likewise
- HoP 1",243
909,"But this is not the case on the other side
- HoP 1",50
910,"Religion from the standpoint of idea, comprehends only what stands on the same platform as itself, and not Philosophy, the Notion, the universal thought determinations
- HoP 1",175
911,"Often no injustice is done to a Philosophy when its opposition to Religion has been made matter of reproach; but often, too, a wrong has been inflicted where this is done from the religious point of view
- HoP 1",211
912,"The form of Religion is necessary to Mind as it is in and for itself; it is the form of truth as it is for all men, and for every mode of consciousness
- HoP 1",159
914,"What is received in evidence of Mind only becomes object to consciousness when it appears in the form of the understanding, that is to say, consciousness must first be already acquainted with these forms from life and from experience
- HoP 1",241
915,"Now, because thinking consciousness is not the outward universal form for all mankind, the consciousness of the true, the spiritual and the rational, must have the form of Religion, and this is the universal justification of this form
- HoP 1",242
916,"There is the question still confronting us as to what attitude we must take in reference to this matter in the history of Philosophy
- HoP 1",140
917,"The religious element to be excluded from the content of the History of Philosophy
- HoP 1",90
918,"Mythology first meets us, and it seems as if it might be drawn within the history of Philosophy
- HoP 1",103
919,"It is indeed a product of the imagination, but not of caprice, although that also has its place here
- HoP 1",108
920,"But the main part of mythology is the work of the imaginative reason, which makes reality its object, but yet has no other means of so doing, than that of sensuous representation, so that the gods make their appearance in human guise
- HoP 1",241
921,"Mythology can now be studied for art, &c But the thinking mind must seek out the substantial content, the thought and the theory implicitly contained therein, as reason is sought in Nature
- HoP 1",196
922,"This mode of treating mythology was that of the Neo-platonists; in recent times it has for the most part become the work of my friend Creuzer in symbolism
- HoP 1",162
923,"This method of treatment is combated and condemned by others
- HoP 1",68
924,"Man, it is said, must set to work historically alone, and it is not historic when a theory unthought of by the ancients, is read into a myth, or brought out of it
- HoP 1",170
925,"In one light, this is quite correct, for it points to a method adopted by Creuzer, and also by the Alexandrians who acted in a similar way
- HoP 1",146
926,"In conscious thought the ancients had not such theories before them, nor did anyone maintain them, yet to say that such content was not implicitly present, is an absurd contention
- HoP 1",187
929,"This sensuous form produced as it is by an historic or natural method, must be determined on many sides, and this external determination must, more or less, be of such a nature as not to express the Idea
- HoP 1",211
931,"But that there is a Reason there, must certainly be recognized, and it is essential so to comprehend and grasp mythology
- HoP 1",128
932,"But Mythology must remain excluded from our history of Philosophy
- HoP 1",73
934,"And this is just what forms the immense distinction which we saw above, between capacity and actuality
- HoP 1",110
935,"The theorems which are implicite contained within Religion do not concern us; they must be in the form of thoughts, since Thought alone is the absolute form of the Idea
- HoP 1",176
936,"In many mythologies, images are certainly used along with their significance, or else the images are closely attended by their interpretation
- HoP 1",149
937,"The ancient Persians worshipped the sun, or fire, as being the highest existence; the first cause in the Persian Religion is Zervane Akerene—unlimited time, eternity
- HoP 1",173
938,"But through two opposed and inimical principles of which the one impels towards what is right, and the other in the opposite direction, if not the whole world, at least this earth is influenced in different ways
- HoP 1",219
939,"Zoroaster has thus emphatically set up the one principle (Ormuzd) as being the Light, and the other (Ahriman) as the Darkness
- HoP 1",133
940,"Between the two (μέσος δὲ ἀμφοῖν) is Mithra, hence called by the Persians the Mediator (μεσίτης)” Mithra is then likewise substance, the universal existence, the sun raised to a totality
- HoP 1",194
941,"It is not the mediator between Ormuzd and Ahriman by establishing peace and leaving each to remain as it was; it does not partake of good and evil both, like an unblest middle thing, but it stands on the side of Ormuzd and strives with him against the evil
- HoP 1",264
942,"Ahriman is sometimes called the first-born son of the Light, but Ormuzd only remained within the Light
- HoP 1",110
943,"At the creation of the visible world, Ormuzd places on the earth in his incomprehensible kingdom of Light, the firm arches of the heavens which are above yet surrounded on every side with the first original Light
- HoP 1",220
944,"Midway to the earth is the high hill Albordi, which reaches into the source of Light
- HoP 1",92
945,"Ormuzd’s empire of Light extended uninterruptedly over the firm vault of the heavens and the hill Albordi, and over the earth too, until the third age was reached
- HoP 1",170
946,"Then Ahriman, whose kingdom of night was formerly bound beneath the earth, broke in upon Ormuzd’s corporeal world and ruled in common with him
- HoP 1",150
947,"Now the space between heaven and earth was divided into light and night
- HoP 1",79
948,"As Ormuzd had formerly only a spiritual kingdom of light, Ahriman had only one of night, but now that they were intermingled he placed the terrestrial light thus created in opposition to the terrestrial night
- HoP 1",216
949,"From this time on, two corporeal worlds stand opposed, one pure and good, and one impure and evil, and this opposition permeates all nature
- HoP 1",147
950,"On Albordi, Ormuzd created Mithra as mediator for the earth
- HoP 1",67
951,"The end of the creation of the bodily world is none other than to reinstate existence, fallen from its creator, to make it good again, and thus to make the evil disappear for ever
- HoP 1",187
952,"The bodily world is the battle-ground between good and evil; but the battle between light and darkness is not in itself an absolute and irreconcilable opposition, but one which can be conquered, and in it Ormuzd, the principle of Light, will be the conqueror
- HoP 1",266
954,"Because properly the Light principle is the only existence of both, and the principle of Darkness is the null and void,—the principle of Light identifies itself with Mithra, which was before called the highest existence
- HoP 1",227
955,"The opposition has laid aside the appearance of contingency, but the spiritual principle is not separate from the physical, because the good and evil are both determined as Light and Darkness
- HoP 1",199
956,"These determinations lie much nearer to Thought; they are not mere images or symbols, but yet these myths do not concern Philosophy
- HoP 1",139
957,"In them Thought does not take the first place, for the myth-form remains predominant
- HoP 1",92
958,"In all religions this oscillation between form and thought is found, and such a combination still lies outside Philosophy
- HoP 1",129
959,"This is also so in the Sanchuniathonic Cosmogony of the Phœnicians

962,"It is there said, “The principles of things are found in Chaos, in which the elements exist undeveloped and confused, and in a Spirit of Air
- HoP 1",148
963,"The latter permeated the chaos, and with it engendered a slimy matter or mud (ἰλύν) which contained within it the living forces and the germs of animals
- HoP 1",160
964,"By mingling this mud with the component matter of chaos and the resulting fermentation, the elements separated themselves
- HoP 1",129
965,"The fire elements ascended into the heights and formed the stars
- HoP 1",72
966,"Through their influence in the air, clouds were formed and the earth was made fruitful
- HoP 1",94
967,"From the mingling of water and earth, through the mud converted into putrefying matter, animals took their origin as imperfect and senseless

970,"Berosus lived in the time of Alexander, is said to have been a Priest of Bel and to have drawn upon the archives of the temple at Babylon
- HoP 1",145
971,"He says, “The original god is Bel and the goddess Omoroka (the sea), but beside them there were yet other gods
- HoP 1",118
972,"Bel divided Omoroka in two, in order to create from her parts heaven and earth
- HoP 1",86
973,"Hereupon he cut off his own head and the human race originated from the drops of his divine blood
- HoP 1",105
974,"After the creation of man, Bel banished the darkness, divided heaven and earth, and formed the world into its natural shape
- HoP 1",131
975,"Since certain parts of the earth seemed to him to be insufficiently populated, he compelled another god to lay hands upon himself, and from his blood more men and more kinds of animals were created

976,"At first the men lived a wild and uncultivated life, until a monster” (called by Berosus, Oannes) “joined them into a state, taught them arts and sciences, and in a word brought Humanity into existence

977,"The monster set about this end with the rising of the sun out of the sea, and with its setting he again hid himself under the waves”  ββ
- HoP 1",144
978,"It has produced philosophers who availed themselves of the mythical form in order to bring their theories and systems more prominently before the imagination, for they made the thoughts the content of the myth
- HoP 1",217
979,"But the myth is not a mere cloak in the ancient myths; it is not merely that the thoughts were there and were concealed
- HoP 1",127
980,"This may happen in our reflecting times; but the first poetry does not start from a separation of prose and poetry
- HoP 1",122
981,"If philosophers used myths, it was usually the case that they had the thoughts and then sought for images appropriate to them; Plato has many beautiful myths of this kind
- HoP 1",178
982,"Others likewise have spoken in myths, as for example, Jacobi, whose Philosophy took the form of the Christian Religion, through which he gave utterance to matter of a highly speculative nature
- HoP 1",200
983,"But this form is not suitable to Philosophy
- HoP 1",51
984,"Thought which has itself as object, must have raised itself to its own form, to the form of thought
- HoP 1",107
985,"Plato is often esteemed on account of his myths; he is supposed to have evinced by their means greater genius than other philosophers were capable of
- HoP 1",157
986,"It is contended here that the myths of Plato are superior to the abstract form of expression, and Plato’s method of representation is certainly a wonderful one
- HoP 1",167
987,"On closer examination we find that it is partly the impossibility of expressing himself after the manner of pure thought that makes Plato put his meaning so, and also such methods of expression are only used by him in introducing a subject
- HoP 1",247
988,"When he comes to the matter in point, Plato expresses himself otherwise, as we see in the Parmenides, where simple thought determinations are used without imagery
- HoP 1",170
989,"Externally these myths may certainly serve when the heights of speculative thought are left behind, in order to present the matter in an easier form, but the real value of Plato does not rest in his myths
- HoP 1",212
990,"If thought once attains power sufficient to give existence to itself within itself and in its element, the myth becomes a superfluous adornment, by which Philosophy is not advanced
- HoP 1",188
991,"Men often lay hold of nothing but these myths
- HoP 1",53
992,"Hence Aristotle has been misunderstood just because he intersperses similes here and there; the simile can never be entirely in accord with thought, for it always carries with it something more
- HoP 1",201
993,"The difficulty of representing thoughts as thoughts always attaches to the expedient of expression in sensuous form
- HoP 1",123
994,"Thought, too, ought not to be concealed by means of the myth, for the object of the mythical is just to give expression to and to reveal thought
- HoP 1",152
995,"The symbol is undoubtedly insufficient for this expression; thought concealed in symbols is not yet possessed, for thought is self-revealing, and hence the myth does not form a medium adequate for its conveyance
- HoP 1",219
996,"Connected with this, there is a similar method of representing the universal content by means of numbers, lines and geometric figures
- HoP 1",141
997,"These are figurative, but not concretely so, as in the case of myths
- HoP 1",76
998,"Thus it may be said that eternity is a circle, the snake that bites its own tail
- HoP 1",88
999,"This is only an image, but Mind does not require such a symbol
- HoP 1",70
1000,"There are people who value such methods of representation, but these forms do not go far
- HoP 1",96
1001,"The most abstract determinations can indeed be thus expressed, but any further progress brings about confusion
- HoP 1",118
1002,"Just as the freemasons have symbols which are esteemed for their depth of wisdom—depth as a brook is deep when one cannot see the bottom—that which is hidden very easily seems to men deep, or as if depth were concealed beneath
- HoP 1",234
1003,"But when it is hidden, it may possibly prove to be the case that there is nothing behind
- HoP 1",96
1004,"This is so in freemasonry, in which everything is concealed to those outside and also to many people within, and where nothing remarkable is possessed in learning or in science, and least of all in Philosophy
- HoP 1",216
1005,"Thought is, on the contrary, simply its manifestation; clearness is its nature and itself
- HoP 1",97
1006,"The act of manifestation is not a condition which may be or may not be equally, so that thought may remain as thought when it is not manifested, but its manifestation is itself, its Being
- HoP 1",195
1007,"Numbers, as will be remarked in respect of the Pythagoreans, are unsuitable mediums for expressing thoughts; thus μονάς, δυάς, τριάς are, with Pythagoras, unity, difference, and unity of the unity and of the difference
- HoP 1",226
1008,"The two first of the three are certainly united by addition; this kind of union is, however, the worst form of unity
- HoP 1",124
1009,"In Religion the three make their appearance in a deeper sense as the Trinity, and in Philosophy as the Notion, but enumeration forms a bad method of expression
- HoP 1",167
1010,"There is the same objection to it as would exist to making the mensuration of space the medium for expressing the absolute
- HoP 1",130
1011,"People also quote the Philosophy of the Chinese, of the Foï, in which it is said that thoughts are represented by numbers
- HoP 1",129
1012,"Yet the Chinese have explained their symbols and hence have made their meaning evident

1013,"Universal simple abstractions have been present to all people who have arrived at any decree of culture
- HoP 1",111
1014,"In the case of the poets whose art has speech as medium, we find all through deep universal thought regarding reality; these are more explicitly expressed in the Indian Religion, but with the Indians everything is mixed up
- HoP 1",230
1015,"Hence it is said that such races have also had a Philosophy proper to themselves; but the universal thoughts of interest in Indian books limit themselves to what is most abstract, to the idea of rising up and passing away, and thus of making a perpetual round
- HoP 1",267
1016,"The story of the Phœnix is well known as an example of this; it is one which took its origin in the East
- HoP 1",112
1017,"We are able similarly to find thoughts about life and death and of the transition of Being into passing away; from life comes death and from death comes life; even in Being, in what is positive, the negation is already present
- HoP 1",234
1018,"The negative side must indeed contain within it the positive, for all change, all the process of life is founded on this
- HoP 1",128
1019,"But such reflections only occasionally come forth; they are not to be taken as being proper philosophic utterances
- HoP 1",122
1020,"For Philosophy is only present when thought, as such, is made the absolute ground and root of everything else, and in these modes of representation this is not so
- HoP 1",170
1021,"Philosophy does not reflect on any particular thing or object already existing as a first substratum; its content is just Thought, universal thought which must plainly come first of all; to put it otherwise, the Absolute must in Philosophy be in the form of thought
- HoP 1",273
1022,"In the Greek Religion we find the thought-determination “eternal necessity;” which means an absolute and clearly universal relation
- HoP 1",139
1023,"But such thought has other subjects besides; it only expresses a relation, the necessity to be the true and all-embracing Being
- HoP 1",135
1024,"Thus neither must we take this form into our consideration
- HoP 1",66
1026,"Particular theories found in Religion
- HoP 1",45
1027,"In conclusion, the philosophy which we find within Religion does not concern us
- HoP 1",87
1028,"We find deep, speculative thoughts regarding the nature of God not only in the Indian Religions, but also in the Fathers and the Schoolmen
- HoP 1",146
1029,"In the history of dogmatism there is a real interest in becoming acquainted with these thoughts, but they do not belong to the history of Philosophy
- HoP 1",156
1030,"Nevertheless more notice must be taken of the Schoolmen than of the Fathers, for they were certainly great philosophers to whom the culture of Christendom owes much
- HoP 1",172
1033,"Thought in this manner does not represent and know itself as the ultimate and absolute culmination of the content, or as the inwardly self-determining Thought
- HoP 1",166
1035,"Philosophic teaching here finds itself within a strongly bound system and not as thought which emanates freely from itself
- HoP 1",130
1036,"Thus with the scholastics, too, Thought does not construct itself out of itself, but depends upon hypotheses; and although it ever rests more and more upon itself, it never does so in opposition to the doctrine of the Church
- HoP 1",232
1037,"Both must and do agree, since Thought has to prove from itself what the Church has already verified
- HoP 1",107
1039,"The second sphere, Religion, is deficient in that it only had the content or the objective moment in common with Philosophy
- HoP 1",131
1040,"In it independent thought was an essential moment, since the subject had an imaginary or historical form
- HoP 1",112
1041,"Philosophy demands the unity and intermingling of these two points of view; it unites the Sunday of life when man in humility renounces himself, and the working-day when he stands up independently, is master of himself and considers his own interests
- HoP 1",258
1042,"A third point of view seems to unite both elements, and that is popular Philosophy
- HoP 1",90
1043,"It deals with universal objects and philosophizes as to God and the world; and thought is likewise occupied in learning about these matters
- HoP 1",147
1044,"Yet this Philosophy must also be cast aside
- HoP 1",51
1045,"The writings of Cicero may be put under this category; they contain a kind of philosophy that has its own place and in which excellent things are said
- HoP 1",158
1046,"Cicero formed many experiences both in the affairs of life and mind, and from them and after observing what takes place in the world, he deduced the truth
- HoP 1",162
1047,"He expresses himself with culture on the concerns most important to man, and hence his great popularity
- HoP 1",111
1048,"Fanatics and mystics may from another point of view be reckoned as in this category
- HoP 1",91
1049,"They give expression to a deep sense of devotion, and have had experiences in the higher regions
- HoP 1",104
1050,"They are able to express the highest content, and the result is attractive
- HoP 1",82
1051,"We thus find the brightest gleams of thought in the writings of a Pascal—as we do in his Pensées
- HoP 1",104
1052,"But the drawback that attaches to this Philosophy is that the ultimate appeal—even in modern times—is made to the fact that men are constituted such as they are by nature, and with this Cicero is very free
- HoP 1",213
1053,"Here the moral instinct comes into question, only under the name of feeling; Religion now rests not on what is objective but on religious feeling, because the immediate consciousness of God by men is its ultimate ground
- HoP 1",227
1054,"Cicero makes copious use of the consensus gentium; in more modern times this appeal has been more or less left alone, since the individual subject has to rest upon himself
- HoP 1",179
1055,"Feeling is first of all laid hold of, then comes reasoning from what is given, but in these we can appeal to what is immediate only
- HoP 1",139
1056,"Independent thought is certainly here advanced; the content too, is taken from the self; but we must just as necessarily exclude this mode of thinking from Philosophy
- HoP 1",174
1057,"For the source from which the content is derived is of the same description as in the other cases
- HoP 1",105
1058,"Nature is the source in finite sciences, and in Religion it is Spirit; but here the source is in authority; the content is given and the act of worship removes but momentarily this externality
- HoP 1",200
1059,"The source of popular Philosophy is in the heart, impulses and capacities, our natural Being, my impression of what is right and of God; the content is in a form which is of nature only
- HoP 1",193
1060,"I certainly have everything in feeling, but the whole content is also in Mythology, and yet in neither is it so in veritable form
- HoP 1",137
1061,"The laws and doctrines of Religion are that in which this content always comes to consciousness in a more definite way, while in feeling there still is intermingled the arbitrary will of that which is subjective
- HoP 1",219
1062,"Now that we have thus defined the Notion of Philosophy to be the Thought which, as the universal content, is complete Being, it will be shown in the history of Philosophy how the determinations in this content make their appearance little by little
- HoP 1",256
1063,"At first we only ask where Philosophy and its History begin
- HoP 1",67
1064,"Freedom of Thought as a first condition
- HoP 1",47
1065,"The general answer is in accordance with what has been said
- HoP 1",67
1066,"Philosophy begins where the universal is comprehended as the all-embracing existence, or where the existent is laid hold of in a universal form, and where thinking about thought first commences
- HoP 1",201
1067,"Where, then, has this occurred?
- HoP 1",39
1068,"Where did it begin?
- HoP 1",27
1069,"That is a question of history
- HoP 1",37
1070,"Thought must be for itself, must come into existence in its freedom, liberate itself from nature and come out of its immersion in mere sense-perception; it must as free, enter within itself and thus arrive at the consciousness of freedom
- HoP 1",245
1071,"Philosophy is properly to be commenced where the Absolute is no more in the form of ordinary conception, and free thought not merely thinks the Absolute but grasps its Idea
- HoP 1",180
1072,"That is to say where Thought grasps as Thought, the Being (which may be Thought itself), which it recognizes as the essence of things, the absolute totality and the immanent essence of everything, and does so as an external Being
- HoP 1",237
1076,"Free, philosophic thought has this direct connection with practical freedom, that as the former supplies thought about the absolute, universal and real object, the latter, because it thinks itself, gives itself the character of universality
- HoP 1",248
1077,"Thinking means the bringing of something into the form of universality; hence Thought first treats of the universal, or determines what is objective and individual in the natural things which are present in sensuous consciousness, as the universal, as an objective Thought
- HoP 1",280
1078,"Its second attribute is that in recognizing and knowing this objective and infinite universal, I, at the same time, remain confronting it from the standpoint of objectivity
- HoP 1",180
1079,"On account of this general connection between political freedom and the freedom of Thought, Philosophy only appears in History where and in as far as free institutions are formed
- HoP 1",186
1080,"Since Mind requires to separate itself from its natural will and engrossment in matter if it wishes to enter upon Philosophy, it cannot do so in the form with which the world-spirit commences and which takes precedence of that separation
- HoP 1",245
1081,"This stage of the unity of Mind with Nature which as immediate is not the true and perfect state, is mainly found in the Oriental conception of existence, therefore Philosophy first begins in the Grecian world
- HoP 1",217
1082,"Separation of the East and its Philosophy
- HoP 1",49
1083,"Some explanations have to be given regarding this first form
- HoP 1",68
1084,"Since Mind in it, as consciousness and will, is but desire, self-consciousness still stands upon its first stage in which the sphere of its idea and will is finite
- HoP 1",171
1085,"As intelligence is thus finite too, its ends are not yet a universal for themselves; but if a people makes for what is moral, if laws and justice are possessed, the character of universality underlies its will
- HoP 1",217
1086,"This presupposes a new power in Mind with which it commences to be free, for the universal will as the relation of thought to thought or as the universal, contains a thought which is at home with itself
- HoP 1",210
1087,"If a people desire to be free, they will subordinate their desires to universal laws, while formerly that which was desired was only a particular
- HoP 1",153
1088,"Now finitude of the will characterizes the orientals, because with them the will has not yet grasped itself as universal, for thought is not yet free for itself
- HoP 1",168
1089,"Hence there can but be the relation of lord and slave, and in this despotic sphere fear constitutes the ruling category
- HoP 1",127
1090,"Because the will is not yet free from what is finite, it can therein be comprehended and the finite can be shown forth as negative
- HoP 1",138
1091,"This sensation of negation, that something cannot last, is just fear as distinguished from freedom which does not consist in being finite but in being for itself, and this cannot be laid hold of
- HoP 1",202
1092,"Religion necessarily has this character, since the fear of the Lord is the essential element beyond which we cannot get
- HoP 1",127
1093,"But man must also have overcome fear through the relinquishment of finite ends, and the satisfaction which that Religion affords is confined to what is finite, seeing that the chief means of reconciliation are natural forms which are impersonated and held in reverence
- HoP 1",276
1094,"The oriental consciousness raises itself, indeed, above the natural content to what is infinite; but it only knows itself as accidental in reference to the power which makes the individual fear
- HoP 1",201
1095,"This subordination may take two forms and must indeed from one extreme pass to the other
- HoP 1",96
1096,"The finite, which is for consciousness, may have the form of finitude as finite, or it may become the infinite, which is however an abstraction
- HoP 1",151
1097,"The man who lives in fear, and he who rules over men through fear, both stand upon the same platform; the difference between them is only in the greater power of will which can go forth to sacrifice all that is finite for some particular end
- HoP 1",249
1098,"The despot brings about what his caprice directs, including certainly what is good, not as law, but as arbitrary will: the passive will, like that of slavery, is converted into the active energy of will, which will, however, is arbitrary still
- HoP 1",251
1100,"The Indians look straight before them for ten years at a time, are fed by those around, and are destitute of other spiritual content than that of knowing what is abstract, which content therefore is entirely finite
- HoP 1",222
1101,"This, then, is not the soil of freedom
- HoP 1",46
1102,"In the East, Mind indeed begins to dawn, but it is still true of it that the subject is not presented as a person, but appears in the objectively substantial, which is represented as partly supersensuous and partly, and even more, material, as negative and perishing
- HoP 1",274
1103,"The highest point attainable by the individual, the everlasting bliss, is made an immersion into substance, a vanishing away of consciousness, and thus of all distinction between substance and individuality—hence an annihilation
- HoP 1",236
1104,"A spiritually dead relation thus comes into existence, since the highest point there to be reached is insensibility
- HoP 1",123
1105,"So far, however, man has not attained that bliss, but finds himself to be a single existent individual, distinguished from the universal substance
- HoP 1",154
1106,"He is thus outside the unity, has no significance, and as being what is accidental and without rights, is finite only; he finds himself limited through Nature—in caste for instance
- HoP 1",188
1107,"The will is not here the substantial will; it is the arbitrary will given up to what is outwardly and inwardly contingent, for substance alone is the affirmative
- HoP 1",169
1109,"The oriental subject thus has the advantage of independence, since there is nothing fixed; however undetermined is the substance of the Easterns, as undetermined, free and independent may their character be
- HoP 1",214
1110,"What for us is justice and morality is also in their state, but in a substantial, natural, patriarchal way, and not in subjective freedom
- HoP 1",145
1111,"Conscience does not exist nor does morality
- HoP 1",51
1112,"Everything is simply in a state of nature, which allows the noblest to exist as it does the worst
- HoP 1",105
1113,"The conclusion to be derived from this is that no philosophic knowledge can be found here
- HoP 1",97
1115,"The Eastern form must therefore be excluded from the History of Philosophy, but still, upon the whole, I will take some notice of it
- HoP 1",140
1116,"I have touched on this elsewhere,8 for some time ago we for the first time reached a position to judge of it
- HoP 1",116
1117,"Earlier a great parade was made about the Indian wisdom without any real knowledge of what it was; now this is for the first time known, and naturally it is found to be in conformity with the rest
- HoP 1",204
1118,"Philosophy proper commences in the West
- HoP 1",47
1119,"The blessedness of the West is thus so determined that in it the subject as such endures and continues in the substantial; the individual mind grasps its Being as universal, but universality is just this relation to itself
- HoP 1",230
1120,"This being at home with self, this personality and infinitude of the “I” constitutes the Being of Mind; it is thus and can be none else
- HoP 1",143
1121,"For a people to know themselves as free, and to be only as universal, is for them to be; it is the principle of their whole life as regards morality and all else
- HoP 1",169
1122,"To take an example, we only know our real Being in so far as personal freedom is its first condition, and hence we never can be slaves
- HoP 1",142
1123,"To sleep, to live, to have a certain office, is not our real Being, and certainly to be no slave is such, for that has come to mean the being in nature
- HoP 1",159
1124,"Thus in the West we are upon the soil of a veritable Philosophy
- HoP 1",71
1125,"Because in desire I am subject to another, and my Being is in a particularity, I am, as I exist, unlike myself; for I am “I,” the universal complete, but hemmed in by passion
- HoP 1",182
1126,"This last is self-will or formal freedom, which has desire as content
- HoP 1",77
1128,"Hence it is here that Philosophy began
- HoP 1",46
1129,"In Greece we first see real freedom flourish, but still in a restricted form, and with a limitation, since slavery was still existent, and the states were by its means conditioned
- HoP 1",187
1130,"In the following abstractions we may first of all superficially describe the freedom of the East, of Greece, and of the Teutonic world
- HoP 1",142
1131,"In the East only one individual is free, the despot; in Greece the few are free; in the Teutonic world the saying is true that all are free, that is, man is free as man
- HoP 1",176
1132,"But since the one in Eastern countries cannot be free because that would necessitate the others also being free to him, impulse, self-will, and formal freedom, can there alone be found
- HoP 1",192
1133,"Since in Greece we have to deal with the particular, the Athenians, and the Spartans, are free indeed, but not the Messenians or the Helots
- HoP 1",147
1134,"The principle of the “few” has yet to be discovered, and this implies some modifications of the Greek point of view which we must consider in connection with the History of Philosophy
- HoP 1",191
1135,"To take these into consideration means simply to proceed to the dividing up of Philosophy
- HoP 1",97
1136,"Since we set to work systematically this division must present itself as necessary
- HoP 1",90
1137,"Speaking generally, we have properly only two epochs to distinguish in the history of Philosophy, as in ancient and modern art—these are the Greek and the Teutonic
- HoP 1",171
1139,"The influence of Greece also reaches into the Roman world, and hence we have to speak of Philosophy in the territory of the Roman world; but the Romans produced no proper Philosophy any more than any proper poets
- HoP 1",220
1140,"They have only received from and imitated others, although they have often done this with intelligence; even their religion is derived from the Greek, and the special character that it has, makes no approach to Philosophy and Art, but is unphilosophical and inartistic
- HoP 1",276
1141,"A further description of these two outstanding opposites must be given
- HoP 1",78
1142,"The Greek world developed thought as far as to the Idea; the Christian Teutonic world, on the contrary, has comprehended Thought as Spirit; Idea and Spirit are thus the distinguishing features
- HoP 1",200
1143,"More particularly the facts are as follows
- HoP 1",50
1145,"The second stage in this universal principle is the gathering up of the determinations manifested thus, into ideal, concrete unity, in the mode of subjectivity
- HoP 1",167
1146,"The first determinations as immediate, were still abstractions, but now the Absolute, as the endlessly self-determining Universal, must furthermore be comprehended as active Thought, and not as the Universal in this determinate character
- HoP 1",245
1147,"Hence it is manifested as the totality of determinations and as concrete individuality
- HoP 1",94
1148,"Thus, with the νοῦς of Anaxagoras, and still more with Socrates, there commences a subjective totality in which Thought grasps itself, and thinking activity is the fundamental principle
- HoP 1",193
1149,"The third stage, then, is that this totality, which is at first abstract, in that it becomes realized through the active, determining, distinguishing thought, sets itself forth even in the separated determinations, which, as ideal, belong to it
- HoP 1",252
1150,"Since these determinations are contained unseparated in the unity, and thus each in it is also the other, these opposed moments are raised into totalities
- HoP 1",162
1151,"The quite general forms of opposition are the universal and the particular, or, in another form, Thought as such, external reality, feeling or perception
- HoP 1",161
1152,"The Notion is the identity of universal and particular; because each of these is thus set forth as concrete in itself, the universal is in itself at once the unity of universality and particularity, and the same holds good of particularity
- HoP 1",247
1154,"The whole concrete universal is now Mind; and the whole concrete individual, Nature
- HoP 1",91
1155,"In Stoicism pure Thought develops into a totality; if we make the other side from Mind—natural being or feeling—into a totality, Epicureanism is the result
- HoP 1",163
1156,"Each determination is formed into a totality of thought, and, in accordance with the simple mode which characterizes this sphere, these principles seem to be for themselves and independent, like two antagonistic systems of Philosophy
- HoP 1",241
1157,"Implicitly both are identical, but they themselves take up their position as conflicting, and the Idea is also, as it is apprehended, in a one-sided determinateness
- HoP 1",172
1158,"The higher stage is the union of these differences
- HoP 1",58
1159,"This may occur in annihilation, in scepticism; but the higher point of view is the affirmative, the Idea in relation to the Notion
- HoP 1",138
1161,"Thus the fourth stage is the union of the Idea, in which all these differences, as totalities, are yet at the same time blended into one concrete unity of Notion
- HoP 1",169
1162,"This comprehension first takes place without constraint, since the ideal is itself only apprehended in the element of universality
- HoP 1",138
1163,"The Greek world got as far as this Idea, since they formed an ideal intellectual world; and this was done by the Alexandrian Philosophy, in which the Greek Philosophy perfected itself and reached its end
- HoP 1",211
1166,"C The last stage of all is, that these surfaces or sides of the triangle join themselves into a body or a totality; the body is for the first time the perfect spacial determination, and that is a reduplication of the triangle
- HoP 1",233
1167,"But in as far as the triangle which forms the basis is outside of the pyramid, this simile does not hold good
- HoP 1",117
1168,"Grecian Philosophy in the Neo-platonists finds its end in a perfect kingdom of Thought and of bliss, and in a potentially existent world of the ideal, which is yet unreal because the whole only exists in the element of universality
- HoP 1",239
1169,"This world still lacks individuality as such, which is an essential moment in the Notion; actuality demands that in the identity of both sides of the Idea, the independent totality shall be also posited as negative
- HoP 1",222
1170,"Through this self-existent negation, which is absolute subjectivity, the Idea is first raised into Mind
- HoP 1",111
1171,"Mind is the subjectivity of self-knowledge; but it is only Mind inasmuch as it knows what is object to itself, and that is itself, as a totality, and is for itself a totality
- HoP 1",182
1172,"That is to say, the two triangles which are above and below in the prism must not be two in the sense of being doubled, but they must be one intermingled unity
- HoP 1",167
1173,"Or, in the case of body, the difference arises between the centre and the peripheral parts
- HoP 1",98
1175,"Hence the Idea is this totality, and the Idea which knows itself is essentially different from the substantial; the former manifests itself independently, but in such a manner that as such it is considered to be for itself substantial
- HoP 1",242
1176,"The subjective Idea is at first only formal, but it is the real possibility of the substantial and of the potentially universal; its end is to realize itself and to identify itself with substance
- HoP 1",203
1177,"Through this subjectivity and negative unity, and through this absolute negativity, the ideal becomes no longer our object merely, but object to itself, and this principle has taken effect in the world of Christianity
- HoP 1",225
1178,"Thus in the modern point of view the subject is for itself free, man is free as man, and from this comes the idea that because he is Mind he has from his very nature the eternal quality of being substantial
- HoP 1",214
1179,"God becomes known as Mind which appears to itself as double, yet removes the difference that it may in it be for and at home with itself
- HoP 1",144
1180,"The business of the world, taking it as a whole, is to become reconciled with Mind, recognizing itself therein, and this business is assigned to the Teutonic world
- HoP 1",171
1181,"The first beginning of this undertaking is found in the Religion which is the contemplation of and faith in this principle as in an actual existence before a knowledge of the principle has been arrived at
- HoP 1",212
1182,"In the Christian Religion this principle is found more as feeling and idea; in it man as man is destined to everlasting bliss, and is an object of divine grace, pity and interest, which is as much as saying that man has an absolute and infinite value
- HoP 1",258
1183,"We find it further in that dogma revealed through Christ to men, of the unity of the divine and human nature, according to which the subjective and the objective Idea—man and God—are one
- HoP 1",194
1184,"Such an aim is pronounced to be the highest end attainable by man
- HoP 1",73
1186,"The first principle of that Philosophy which has taken its place in Christendom is thus found in the existence of two totalities
- HoP 1",136
1187,"This is a reduplication of substance which now, however, is characterized by the fact that the two totalities are no longer external to one another, but are clearly both required through their relation to one another
- HoP 1",224
1189,"We have here the true speculative Idea, the Notion in its determinations, each of which is brought into a totality and clearly relates to the other
- HoP 1",155
1190,"Thus the determinations are in it more concrete than with the ancients
- HoP 1",78
1192,"The Greek Philosophy is free from restraint because it does not yet have regard to the opposition between Being and Thought, but proceeds from the unconscious presupposition that Thought is also Being
- HoP 1",208
1193,"Certainly certain stages in the Greek Philosophy are laid hold of which seem to stand on the same platform as the Christian philosophies
- HoP 1",144
1195,"But there is really a difference
- HoP 1",40
1197,"But though it is the phenomenal that lies at the foundation of things, it is not asserted that there is likewise a knowledge of the true and existent, as in the case of the merely subjective idealists of a more modern day
- HoP 1",229
1198,"These last still keep in the background a potentiality, a beyond which cannot be known through thought or through conception
- HoP 1",132
1199,"This other knowledge is an immediate knowledge—a faith in, a view of, and a yearning after, the beyond such as was evinced by Jacobi
- HoP 1",140
1200,"The ancients have no such yearning; on the contrary, they have perfect satisfaction and rest in the certitude that only that which appears is for Knowledge
- HoP 1",163
1201,"Thus it is necessary in this respect to keep strictly to the point of view from which we start, else through the similarity of the results, we come to see in that old Philosophy all the determinate character of modern subjectivity
- HoP 1",238
1202,"Since in the simplicity of ancient philosophy the phenomenal was itself the only sphere, doubts as to objective thought were not present to it
- HoP 1",150
1204,"This is faith as understood by the church, or faith in the modern sense, ie a rejection of reason in favour of an inward revelation, called a direct certainty or perception, or an implicit and intuitive feeling
- HoP 1",218
1205,"The opposition between this knowledge, which has first of all to develop itself, and that knowledge which has already developed itself inwardly, arouses a peculiar interest
- HoP 1",180
1209,"Yet in the course of history this is difficult
- HoP 1",54
1210,"As regards the latter we must distinguish the time when Philosophy made its formal appearance as Philosophy and the period of formation and of preparation for modern times
- HoP 1",179
1211,"We may first begin Teutonic philosophy where it appears in proper form as Philosophy
- HoP 1",92
1213,"Hence the history of Philosophy falls into three periods—that of the Greek Philosophy, the Philosophy of the Middle Ages and the modern Philosophy
- HoP 1",154
1214,"Of these the first is speaking generally, regulated by Thought, the second falls into the opposition between existence and formal reflection, but the third has the Notion as its ground
- HoP 1",192
1215,"This must not be taken to mean that the first contains Thought alone; it also has conceptions and ideas, just as the latter begins from abstract thoughts which yet constitute a duality
- HoP 1",192
1217,"The Neo-platonic philosophy then made its entrance into Christianity later on, and many philosophies within Christianity have this philosophy as their only groundwork
- HoP 1",174
1218,"This is a space of time extending to about 1000 years, the end of which coincides with the migration of the nations and the decline of the Roman Empire
- HoP 1",159
1219,"Second Period—The second period is that of the Middle Ages
- HoP 1",66
1220,"The Scholastics are included in it, and Arabians and Jews are also historically to be noticed, but this philosophy mainly falls within the Christian Church
- HoP 1",163
1221,"This period is of something over 1000 years’ duration
- HoP 1",61
1222,"Third Period—The Philosophy of modern times made its first independent appearance after the Thirty Years’ War, with Bacon, Jacob Böhm and Descartes; it begins with the distinction contained in: cogito ergo sum
- HoP 1",217
1223,"This period is one of a couple of centuries and the philosophy is consequently still somewhat modern
- HoP 1",108
1224,"There historians are the fountainheads, which again have as sources the deeds and sayings of individuals; and the historians who are not original have over and above performed their work at secondhand
- HoP 1",208
1226,"In the history of Philosophy there are, on the contrary, not any sources which can be derived from historians, but the deeds themselves lie before us, and these—the philosophic operations themselves—are the true sources
- HoP 1",227
1227,"If we wish to study the history of Philosophy in earnest, we must go to such springs as these
- HoP 1",101
1228,"Yet these operations form too wide a field to permit of our keeping to it alone in this history
- HoP 1",103
1230,"There are other periods, too, where it is desirable that others should have read the works of the philosophers and that we should receive abstracts therefrom
- HoP 1",165
1231,"Several schoolmen have left behind them works of sixteen, twenty-four and twenty-six folios, and hence we must in their case confine ourselves to the researches of others
- HoP 1",178
1232,"Many philosophic works are also rare and hence difficult to obtain
- HoP 1",74
1233,"Many philosophers are for the most part important from an historic or literary point of view only, and hence we may limit ourselves to the compilations in which they are dealt with
- HoP 1",188

- HoP 1",145

- HoP 1",269
1289,"Thus when the history of Philosophy has to tell of deeds in history, we first ask, what a deed in Philosophy is; and whether any particular thing is philosophic or not
- HoP 1",175
1290,"In external history everything is in action—certainly there is in it what is important and that which is unimportant—but action is the idea immediately placed before us
- HoP 1",176
1291,"This is not the case in Philosophy, and on this account the history of Philosophy cannot be treated throughout without the introduction of the historian’s views
- HoP 1",168
1292,"ORIENTAL PHILOSOPHY   THE first Philosophy in order is the so-called Oriental, which, however, does not enter into the substance or range of our subject as represented here
- HoP 1",180
1293,"Its position is preliminary, and we only deal with it at all in order to account for not treating of it at greater length, and to show in what relation it stands to Thought and to true Philosophy
- HoP 1",203
1294,"The expression Eastern philosophy is specially employed in reference to the period in which this great universal Oriental conception aroused the East—the land of circumscription and of limitation, where the spirit of subjectivity reigns
- HoP 1",244
1299,"The Orientals certainly have also individual forms, such as Brahma, Vishnu and Civa, but because freedom is wanting the individuality is not real, but merely superficial
- HoP 1",177
1300,"And so much is this the case, that when we suppose that we have to deal with a human form, the same loses itself again and expands into the illimitable
- HoP 1",159
1301,"Just as we hear amongst the Greeks of a Uranus and Chronos—of Time individualized—we find with the Persians, Zeroane Akerene, but it is Time unlimited
- HoP 1",158
1302,"We find Ormuzd and Ahriman to be altogether general forms and ideas; they appear to be universal principles which thus seem to bear a relationship to Philosophy or even seem to be themselves philosophic
- HoP 1",210
1303,"Just as the content of the Eastern religions, God, the essentially existent, the eternal, is comprehended somewhat in the light of universal, we find the relative positions of individuals to Him to be the same
- HoP 1",217
1304,"In the Eastern religions the first condition is that only the one substance shall, as such, be the true, and that the individual neither can have within himself, nor can he attain to any value in as far as he maintains himself as against the being in and for itself
- HoP 1",273
1305,"He can have true value only through an identification with this substance in which he ceases to exist as subject and disappears into unconsciousness
- HoP 1",156
1307,"The higher point of view implicitly contained in the Greek individual freedom, this happier, larger life, makes more difficult the work of Thought, which is to give due value to the universal
- HoP 1",199
1308,"In the East, on the contrary, the substantial in Religion is certainly on its own view the principal matter, the essential—and with it lawlessness, the absence of individual consciousness is immediately connected—and this substance is undoubtedly a philosophic idea
- HoP 1",273
1309,"The negation of the finite is also present, but in such a manner that the individual only reaches to its freedom in this unity with the substantial
- HoP 1",155
1310,"In as far as in the Eastern mind, reflection, consciousness come through thought to distinction and to the determination of principles, there exist such categories and such definite ideas not in unity with the substantial
- HoP 1",229
1311,"The destruction of all that is particular either is an illimitable, the exaltitude of the East, or, in so far as that which is posited and determined for itself is known, it is a dry, dead understanding, which cannot take up the speculative Notion into itself
- HoP 1",267
1312,"To that which is true, this finite can exist only as immersed in substance; if kept apart from this it remains dead and arid
- HoP 1",132
1313,"It is the same as in their worship, which is complete immersion in devotion and then an endless number of ceremonials and of religious actions; and this on the other side is the exaltitude of that illimitable in which everything disappears
- HoP 1",247
1314,"There are two Eastern nations with which I wish just now to deal—the Chinese and the Indian
- HoP 1",99
1315,"It is true of the Chinese as well as of the Indians that they have a great reputation for culture; but this, as well as the amount of Indian literature which exists, has largely diminished through a further knowledge of it
- HoP 1",230
1316,"The great knowledge of these people bears upon such subjects as Religion, Science, the constitution and administration of the state, poetry, handicrafts and commerce
- HoP 1",173
1317,"But when we compare the laws and constitution of China with the European, we find that we can only do so in respect of what is formal, for the content is very different
- HoP 1",176
1318,"It is also felt, however consistently they may be constituted as to form, that they cannot find their place with us, that we could not allow of their giving us satisfaction, and that they take the place of law, or rather that they put an end to it
- HoP 1",255
1319,"It is the same thing when we compare Indian poetry with European; considered as a mere play of the imagination it is as brilliant, rich and cultured as that of any other people
- HoP 1",184
1320,"But in poetry we have to do with content, and that is the important part of it
- HoP 1",86
1321,"Even the Homeric poetry is not serious for us, and hence such poetry cannot last
- HoP 1",88
1322,"It is not the lack of genius in the Oriental poetry; the amount of genius is the same and the form may be very much developed, but the content remains confined within certain bounds and cannot satisfy us, nor can it be our content
- HoP 1",238
1323,"This is at outset a fact applying universally to such comparisons, inasmuch as men let themselves be dazzled by form, making it equal with, or even preferring it to ours
- HoP 1",177
1324,"The first subject of remark with regard to the Chinese respects the teaching of Confucius (500 years before Christ) which made a great sensation in Liebnitz’ time; this teaching is a moral philosophy
- HoP 1",207
1325,"Confucius has, besides, commented upon the old traditional principles of the Chinese; his high moral teaching, however, gave him his great fame, and that teaching is the authority most esteemed in China
- HoP 1",210
1327,"We have conversations between Confucius and his followers in which there is nothing definite further than a commonplace moral put in the form of good, sound doctrine, which may be found as well expressed and better, in every place and amongst every people
- HoP 1",263
1328,"Cicero gives us De Officiis, a book of moral teaching more comprehensive and better than all the books of Confucius
- HoP 1",123
1329,"He is hence only a man who has a certain amount of practical and worldly wisdom—one with whom there is no speculative philosophy
- HoP 1",136
1330,"The treatise which the Jesuits produced9 is, however, more a paraphrase than a translation
- HoP 1",98
1331,"The Philosophy of the Y-king
- HoP 1",36
1332,"A second matter of remark is that the Chinese have also taken up their attention with abstract thoughts and with pure categories
- HoP 1",136
1333,"The old book Y-king, or the Book of Principles, serves as the foundation for such; it contains the wisdom of the Chinese, and its origin is attributed to Fohi
- HoP 1",166
1334,"That which is there by him related passes into what is quite mythological, fabulous and even senseless
- HoP 1",110
1336,"These symbols are quite abstract categories, and consequently the most superficial determinations of the understanding
- HoP 1",126
1337,"It must certainly be considered that pure thoughts are brought to consciousness, but in this case we make no advance, merely remaining stationary so far as they are concerned
- HoP 1",182
1338,"The concrete is not conceived of speculatively, but is simply taken from ordinary ideas, inasmuch as it is expressed in accordance with their forms of representation and of perception
- HoP 1",191
1339,"Hence in this collection of concrete principles there is not to be found in one single instance a sensuous conception of universal natural or spiritual powers
- HoP 1",166
1340,"To satisfy the curious, I will give these principles in greater detail
- HoP 1",78
1341,"The two fundamental, figures are a horizontal line (⚊, Yang) and the one which is broken into two equal parts (⚋, Yin)
- HoP 1",126
1342,"The first which is the perfect, the father, the manlike, the unity, such as is represented by the Pythagoreans, represents the affirmative; the second is the imperfect, the mother, the womanly, the duality and the negation
- HoP 1",230
1343,"These signs are held in high esteem, for they are considered to be the Principles of things
- HoP 1",99
1344,"First of all they are placed in combination of two from which four figures result: ⚌, ⚍, ⚎, ⚏, or the great Yang, the little Yang, the little Yin, and the great Yin
- HoP 1",172
1345,"The signification of these four representations is matter as perfect and imperfect
- HoP 1",90
1346,"The two Yangs are perfect matter: the first is in the category of youth and power; the second is the same matter, but as old and powerless
- HoP 1",146
1347,"The third and fourth images, where Yin constitutes the basis, are imperfect matter, which has again the two determinations of youth and age, strength and weakness
- HoP 1",170
1348,"These lines are further united in sets of three, and thus eight figures result, which are called Kua, ☰, ☱, ☲, ☳, ☴, ☵, ☶, ☷
- HoP 1",132
1349,"I will give the interpretation of these Kua just to show how superficial it is
- HoP 1",86
1350,"The first sign, containing the great Yang and the Yang is the Heavens (Tien) or the all-pervading ether
- HoP 1",111
1351,"The Heavens to the Chinese means what is highest, and it has been a great source of division amongst the missionaries whether they ought to call the Christian God, Tien, or not
- HoP 1",184
1352,"The second sign is pure water (Tui), the third pure fire (Li), the fourth thunder (Tschin), the fifth wind (Siun), the sixth common water (Kan), the seventh mountains (Ken), the eighth the earth (Kuen)
- HoP 1",209
1353,"We should not place heaven, thunder, wind and mountains on the same footing
- HoP 1",83
1354,"We may thus obtain a philosophic origin for everything out of these abstract thoughts of absolute unity and duality
- HoP 1",123
1355,"All symbols have the advantage of indicating thoughts and of calling up significations, and in this way such are likewise present there
- HoP 1",143
1356,"Thought thus forms the first beginning, but afterwards it goes into the clouds, and Philosophy does likewise
- HoP 1",116
1357,"Therefore if Windischmann11 in his commentary recognizes in this system of Confucius, a “thorough interconnection between all Kua in the whole series,” it should be remembered that not a particle of the Notion is to be found in it
- HoP 1",238
1358,"United further in sets of four, the lines produce sixty-four figures, which the Chinese consider to be the origin of their characters, since there have been added to these straight lines those which are perpendicular and inclined in different directions
- HoP 1",261
1359,"In Schuking there is also a chapter on Chinese wisdom, where the five elements from which everything is made make their appearance
- HoP 1",138
1360,"These are fire, water, wood, metal and earth, which exist all in confusion, and which we should no more than we did before, allow to be principles
- HoP 1",154
1362,"This is the principle of all Chinese wisdom and of all the objects of study in China
- HoP 1",92
1363,"There is yet another separate sect, that of the Tao-See, the followers of which are not mandarins and attached to the state religion, nor are they Buddhists or Lamaics
- HoP 1",175
1367,"It is only in her imperfect state that she is considered with affection; who desires to know her must be devoid of passions” Abel Rémusat says that taken at its best this might be expressed by the Greek in όογος
- HoP 1",219
1369,"Thou meetest him and seest not his head; thou goest behind him and seest not his back” These contradictory expressions are called the “chain of reason” One naturally thinks in quoting these passages of יהרה and of the African kingly name of Juba and also of Jovis
- HoP 1",271
1370,"This I-hi-weï or I-H-W16 is further made to signify an absolute vacuity and that which is Nothing; to the Chinese what is highest and the origin of things is nothing, emptiness, the altogether undetermined, the abstract universal, and this is also called Tao or reason
- HoP 1",276
1371,"But if Philosophy has got no further than to such expression, it still stands on its most elementary stage
- HoP 1",114
1372,"What is there to be found in all this learning?
- HoP 1",55
1373,"If we had formerly the satisfaction of believing in the antiquity of the Indian wisdom and of holding it in respect, we now have ascertained through being acquainted with the great astronomical works of the Indians, the inaccuracy of all figures quoted
- HoP 1",260
1374,"Nothing can be more confused, nothing more imperfect than the chronology of the Indians; no people which has attained to culture in astronomy, mathematics, &c, is as incapable for history; in it they have neither stability nor coherence
- HoP 1",244
1375,"The Indians have lines of kings and an enormous quantity of names, but everything is vague
- HoP 1",98
1377,"Indian culture is developed to a high degree, and it is imposing, but its Philosophy is identical with its Religion, and the objects to which attention is devoted in Philosophy are the same as those which we find brought forward in Religion
- HoP 1",248
1378,"Hence the holy books or Vedas also form the general groundwork for Philosophy
- HoP 1",85
1379,"The Vedas even constitute the basis for the atheistical Indian philosophies; these, too, are not wanting in gods, and they pay genuine attention to the Vedas
- HoP 1",165
1380,"Indian Philosophy thus stands within Religion just as scholastic Philosophy stands within Christian dogmatism, having at its basis and presupposing the doctrines of the church
- HoP 1",183
1382,"The idea of the Indians more appropriately expressed, is that there is one universal substance which may be laid hold of in the abstract or in the concrete, and out of which everything takes its origin
- HoP 1",209
1383,"The summit of man’s attainment is that he as consciousness should make himself identical with the substance, in Religion by means of worship, offerings, and rigid acts of expiation, and in Philosophy through the instrumentality of pure thought
- HoP 1",251
1384,"It is quite recently that we first obtained a definite knowledge of Indian Philosophy; in the main we understand by it religious ideas, but in modern times men have learned to recognize real philosophic writings
- HoP 1",219
1385,"Colebrooke,17 in particular, communicated abstracts to us from two Indian philosophic works, and this forms the first contribution we have had in reference to Indian Philosophy
- HoP 1",184
1386,"He is one of the first Germans who took up his attention with Indian philosophy, yet his work bore little fruit because he himself read no more than the index to the Ramayana
- HoP 1",182
1388,"The one part, which really is orthodox, has no other purpose than to make the deliverances of the Vedas clearer, or to derive from the text of these original treatises an ingeniously thought-out Psychology
- HoP 1",213
1389,"This system is called Mimansa, and two schools proceed from it
- HoP 1",70
1390,"Distinguished from these there are other systems, amongst which the two chief are those of the Sanc’hya and Nyaya
- HoP 1",121
1391,"The former again divides into two parts which are, however, different in form only
- HoP 1",90
1392,"The Nyaya is the most developed; it more particularly gives the rules for reasoning, and may be compared to the Logic of Aristotle
- HoP 1",138
1393,"Colebrooke has made abstracts from both of these systems, and he says that there are many ancient treatises upon them, and that the versus memoriales from them are very extensive
- HoP 1",186
1394,"The Sanc’hya Philosophy of Capila
- HoP 1",41
1395,"The originator of the Sanc’hya is called Capila, and he was an ancient sage of whom it was said that he was a son of Brahma, and one of the seven great Holy men; others say that he was an incarnation of Vishnu, like his disciple Asuri, and that he was identified with fire
- HoP 1",280
1396,"As to the age of the Aphorisms (Sutras) of Capila, Colebrooke can say nothing; he merely mentions that they were already mentioned in other very ancient books, but he does not feel able to say anything definite in the matter
- HoP 1",232
1397,"The Sanc’hya is divided into different schools, of which there are two or three, which, however, differ from one another only in a few particulars
- HoP 1",154
1398,"It is held to be partly heterodox and partly orthodox
- HoP 1",61
1399,"The real aim of all Indian schools and systems of Philosophy, whether atheistic or theistic, is to teach the means whereby eternal happiness can be attained before, as well as after, death
- HoP 1",196
1400,"This blessed condition therefore is, according to the Sanc’hya, a perfect and eternal release from every kind of ill
- HoP 1",124
1402,"Other methods of deliverance from evil are in the excessive acts of penance performed by the Indians, to which a retreat within themselves is added
- HoP 1",155
1403,"Now when the Indian thus internally collects himself, and retreats within his own thoughts, the moment of such pure concentration is called Brahma, the one and the clearly supersensuous state, which the understanding calls the highest possible existence
- HoP 1",261
1404,"When this is so with me, then am I Brahma
- HoP 1",49
1405,"Such a retreat into Thought takes place in the Religion as well as in the Philosophy of the Indians, and they assert with reference to this state of bliss that it is what is highest of all, and that even the gods do not attain to it
- HoP 1",240
1406,"Indra, for example, the god of the visible heavens, is much lower than the soul in this life of internal contemplation; many thousand Indras have passed away, but the soul is exempt from every change
- HoP 1",207
1407,"The Sanc’hya only differs from Religion in that it has a complete system of thought or logic, and that the abstraction is not made a reduction to what is empty, but is raised up into the significance of a determinate thought
- HoP 1",232
1408,"This science is stated to subsist in the correct knowledge of the principles—which may be outwardly perceptible or not—of the material and of the immaterial world
- HoP 1",170
1409,"The Sanc’hya system separates itself into three parts: the method of knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the determinate form of the knowledge of principles
- HoP 1",168
1411,"Perception is said to require no explanation
- HoP 1",52
1412,"Inference is a conclusion arrived at from the operation of cause and effect, by which one determination merely passes over into a second
- HoP 1",144
1413,"There are three forms, because inferences are made either from cause to effect, from effect to cause, or in accordance with different relations of cause and effect
- HoP 1",171
1414,"Rain, we may say, is foretold when a cloud is seen to be gathering; fire, when a hill is seen to be smoking; or the movement of the moon is inferred when, at different times, it is observed to be in different places
- HoP 1",223
1415,"These are simple, dry relations, originating from the understanding
- HoP 1",75
1417,"Of objects of knowledge or of principles, the Sanc’hya gives five-and-twenty; and these I will mention to show the want of order that is in them
- HoP 1",152
1418,"Nature, as the origin of everything, is said to be the universal, the material cause, eternal matter, undistinguished and undistinguishable, without parts, productive but without production, absolute substance
- HoP 1",217
1419,"Intelligence, the first production of Nature and itself producing other principles, distinguishable as three gods through the efficacy of three qualities, which are Goodness, Foulness and Darkness
- HoP 1",204
1420,"These form one person and three gods, namely, Brahma, Vishnu, and Maheswara
- HoP 1",83
1421,"It issues from the power of intelligence, and itself brings forth the following principles
- HoP 1",98
1423,"The eleven succeeding principles are the organs of feeling, which are produced by the personality
- HoP 1",105
1424,"There are ten external organs, comprising the five senses and five active organs—the organs of the voice, hands and feet, the excretory and genital organs
- HoP 1",162
1425,"The eleventh organ is that of the inward sense
- HoP 1",54
1426,"These principles are the five elements brought forth from the earlier-named rudiments—the ether which takes possession of space, air, fire, water and earth
- HoP 1",163
1427,"In this very unsystematic form we see only the first beginnings of reflection, which seem to be put together as a universal
- HoP 1",131
1428,"But this arrangement is, to say nothing of being unsystematic, not even intelligent
- HoP 1",91
1429,"Formerly the principles were outside of and successive to one another; their unity is found in the Soul
- HoP 1",111
1430,"It is said of the latter that it is not produced, and is not productive; it is individual, and hence there are many souls; it is sentient, eternal, immaterial and unchangeable
- HoP 1",183
1431,"Colebrooke here distinguishes between the theistic and atheistic systems of the Sanc’hya, since the former not only admits of individual souls, but also upholds God (Iswara) as the ruler of the world
- HoP 1",207
1432,"The knowledge of the soul still remains the principal point
- HoP 1",67
1434,"Through the union of Soul and Nature, the creation is effected, and this consists in the development of intelligence and of other principles
- HoP 1",148
1435,"This unity is the actual support for that which is, and the means by which it is so maintained
- HoP 1",102
1436,"It is at the same time an important consideration that the negation of the object which is contained in thought, is necessary in order to comprehend; this reflection has far more depth than the ordinary talk about immediate consciousness
- HoP 1",245
1437,"The view is superficial and perverted which maintains the Easterns to have lived in unity with nature; the soul in its activity, mind, is indeed undoubtedly in relation with nature and in unity with the truth of nature
- HoP 1",226
1438,"But this true unity essentially contains the moment of the negation of nature as it is in its immediacy; such an immediate unity is merely the life of animals, the life and perception of the senses
- HoP 1",205
1439,"The idea which is present to the Indians is thus indeed the unity of nature and of soul, but the spiritual is only one with nature in so far as it is within itself, and at the same time manifests the natural as negative
- HoP 1",227
1440,"As regards the creation, this is further signified
- HoP 1",58
1441,"The soul’s desire and end is for satisfaction and freedom, and with this view it is endowed with a subtle environment, in which all the above-mentioned principles are contained, but only in their elementary development
- HoP 1",226
1442,"Something of our ideal, or of the implicit is present in this idea; it is like the blossom which is ideally in the bud, and yet is not actual and real
- HoP 1",158
1443,"The expression for this is Lingam, the generative power of nature, which holds a high place in the estimation of all Indians
- HoP 1",132
1444,"This subtle form, says the Sanc’hya, also assumes a coarse bodily shape, and clothes itself in several garbs; and as a means of preventing the descent into a coarse materiality, philosophic contemplation is recommended
- HoP 1",226
1445,"Hitherto we have observed the abstract principles; the following is to be noticed regarding the creation of the concrete actuality of the universe
- HoP 1",154
1446,"The bodily creation consists of the soul habited in a material body; it comprehends eight orders of higher beings and five orders of lower beings, which constitute—with men, who form a single class—fourteen orders, and these are divided into three worlds or classes
- HoP 1",273
1447,"The first eight orders have appellations which appear in Indian mythology, viz Brahma, Prajapatis, Indra, &c; there are both gods and demi-gods, and Brahma himself is represented here as if he were created
- HoP 1",213
1448,"The five lower orders are composed of animals: the four-footed animals are in two classes, birds come third, reptiles, fishes, and insects fourth, and, finally, vegetable and inorganic nature comes fifth
- HoP 1",211
1450,"Against these three worlds, which have their place in the material creation, the system places yet another creation, and that is the Intellectual, consisting of the powers of understanding and the senses
- HoP 1",211
1451,"These last are again divided into four classes, viz those determinations which impede, those which incapacitate, those which satisfy, and those which perfect the intelligence
- HoP 1",182
1452,"Sixty-two of the impeding determinations are adduced; eight kinds of error, as many of opinion or of illusion, ten of passion as being illusion carried to extremity, eighteen of hate or sullenness, and the same of grief
- HoP 1",227
1453,"Here there is shown somewhat of an empirical, psychological, and observing mode of treatment
- HoP 1",100
1454,"The incapacity of intelligence has again eight-and-twenty variations: injury, want of organs, &c 3
- HoP 1",106
1455,"Satisfaction is either inward or outward
- HoP 1",48
1457,"The second satisfaction is in the belief of securing liberty through ascetic exercises, pains, torments, and penances
- HoP 1",125
1458,"The third has to do with time—the idea that liberty will come in the course of time and without study
- HoP 1",109
1459,"The fourth satisfaction is obtained in a belief in luck—in believing that liberty depends on fate
- HoP 1",105
1460,"The external mode of obtaining satisfaction relates to continence from enjoyment, but continence from sensuous motives, such as dislike to the unrest of acquisition, and fear of the evil consequences of enjoyment
- HoP 1",220
1461,"There are, again, several means of perfecting the intelligence adduced, and, amongst others, there is the direct psychological mode of perfecting mind, as is seen in the act of reasoning, in friendly converse, and so on
- HoP 1",227
1462,"This we may find, indeed, in our applied logic
- HoP 1",54
1463,"There is still somewhat to be remarked as to the main points of the system
- HoP 1",82
1464,"The Sanc’hya, and likewise the other Indian systems of Philosophy, occupy themselves particularly with the three qualities (Guna) of the absolute Idea, which are represented as substances and as modifications of nature
- HoP 1",226
1465,"It is noteworthy that in the observing consciousness of the Indians it struck them that what is true and in and for itself contains three determinations, and the Notion of the Idea is perfected in three moments
- HoP 1",218
1466,"This sublime consciousness of the trinity, which we find again in Plato and others, then went astray in the region of thinking contemplation, and retains its place only in Religion, and there but as a Beyond
- HoP 1",215
1467,"Then the understanding penetrated through it, declaring it to be senseless; and it was Kant who broke open the road once more to its comprehension
- HoP 1",154
1468,"The reality and totality of the Notion of everything, considered in its substance, is absorbed by the triad of determinations; and it has become the business of our times to bring this to consciousness
- HoP 1",209
1470,"It prevails in fire, and therefore flames rise up and sparks fly upwards; if it has ascendency in men, as it does have in the eight higher orders, it is the origin of virtue
- HoP 1",181
1471,"This also is the universal—throughout and in every aspect the affirmative—in abstract form
- HoP 1",98
1473,"The third and last quality is darkness (Tamas); it is inert and obstructive, allied to care, dullness, and disappointment, predominating in earth and water, and hence these fall down and tend ever downwards
- HoP 1",214
1475,"As far as we are concerned, the important distinction is that the third principle is not the return to the first which Mind and Idea demand, and which is effected by the removal of the negation in order to effect a reconciliation with itself and to go back within itself
- HoP 1",278
1476,"With the Indians the third is still change and negation
- HoP 1",63
1477,"These three qualities are represented as the essential being of nature
- HoP 1",78
1481,"The Sanc’hya ascribes this power to man, in so far as he elevates himself through the working of his thought into inward subjectivity
- HoP 1",141
1484,"But the quickest mode of reaching happiness through deep contemplation is that worship of God which consists in ever murmuring the mystic name of God, ‘Om’” This idea is a very general one
- HoP 1",196
1485,"Colebrooke deals more particularly with the theistic and atheistic divisions of the Sanc’hya as distinguished
- HoP 1",117
1488,"Everything proceeds from the great Principle, which is Intelligence;” to this the individual soul belongs, and through this it is brought about
- HoP 1",151
1489,"Of the various kinds of knowledge already given, that of reasoning, of the connection existing with the conclusion through the relation of cause and effect, remains the chief, and I will show how the Indians comprehend this relation
- HoP 1",240
1490,"The understanding and all other principles derived from it are to them effects, and from these they reason to their causes; in one respect this is analogous to our inference, but in another different
- HoP 1",207
1491,"They perceive that “effects exist even before the operation of the causes; for what does not exist cannot be made explicit in existence through causality” Colebrooke says, “This means that effects are educts rather than products” But the question is just what products are
- HoP 1",280
1492,"As an example of how the effect is already contained in the cause, the following is given:—Oil is already existent in the seeds of sesamum before it is pressed out; rice is in the husk before it is thrashed; milk is in the udder of the cow before it is milked
- HoP 1",267
1493,"Cause and effect are in reality the same; a piece of a dress is not really different from the yarn from which it is woven, for the material is the same
- HoP 1",159
1494,"This is how this relation is understood
- HoP 1",47
1495,"A consequence derived from it was the eternity of the world, for the saying “Out of nothing there comes nothing,” which Colebrooke also mentions, is opposed to the belief in a creation of the world from nothing in our religious sense
- HoP 1",241
1497,"Moisture is the same as rain; or again we speak in mechanics of different movements, whereas motion has the same velocity before as after impact
- HoP 1",152
1498,"The ordinary consciousness cannot comprehend the fact that there is no real distinction between cause and effect
- HoP 1",120
1499,"The Indians infer the existence of “a universal cause which is undistinguishable, while determinate things are finite,” and on this account there must be a cause permeating through them
- HoP 1",193
1500,"Even intelligence is an effect of this cause, which is the soul in so far as it is creative in this identity with nature after its abstraction from it
- HoP 1",158
1501,"Effect proceeds from cause, yet, on the other hand, this last is not independent, but goes back into universal cause
- HoP 1",124
1502,"General destruction is postulated along with what is called the creation of the three worlds
- HoP 1",100
1504,"To this the three qualities, goodness, passion, and darkness, are attributed; the further attributes of these determinations may be very interesting, but they are understood in a very superficial way
- HoP 1",207
1506,"There are hence only the categories of admixture and of modification present
- HoP 1",84
1507,"The Indians say:—“Nature has these three qualities in her own right as her forms and characteristics; other things have them only because they are present in them as effects of the former”  We still have to consider the relation of nature to spirit
- HoP 1",256
1508,"Nature is like a bajadere showing herself to the soul as to an audience; she is abused for her impudence in exposing herself too often to the rude gaze of the spectators
- HoP 1",177
1510,"The philosophy of Gotama and that of Canade belong to one another18 The philosophy of Gotama is called Nyaya (reasoning), and that of Canade, Vaiseshica (particular)
- HoP 1",173
1511,"The first is a specially perfect dialectic, and the second, on the other hand, occupies itself with physics, that is, with particular or sensuous objects
- HoP 1",161
1512,"Colebrooke says:—“No department of science or of literature has taken up the attention of the Indians more than the Nyaya; and the fruit of this study is an infinite number of writings, included in which there may be found the works of very celebrated men of learning
- HoP 1",275
1513,"The system which Gotama and Canade observe is that indicated in one part of the Vedas as being the path which must be trodden in the pursuit of learning and study; viz, enunciation, definition, and investigation
- HoP 1",219
1514,"Enunciation is the specification of a thing by its name, that is, by the expression denoting it, as revelation directs; for language is considered as revealed to man
- HoP 1",173
1515,"Definition sets forth the particular quality which constitutes the real character of a thing
- HoP 1",100
1516,"Investigation consists in an inquiry into the adequacy and sufficiency of the definition
- HoP 1",96
1518,"What comes next is the object to be contemplated
- HoP 1",56
1520,"Soul then is itself the object which is to be known and proved
- HoP 1",70
1521,"This has still to be shown more particularly
- HoP 1",52
1523,"The third kind of evidence is comparison, the fourth, trustworthy authority, including both tradition and the revelation implied in it
- HoP 1",142
1524,"These kinds of proof are much brought forward, both in the ancient Treatise ascribed to Gotama and in innumerable commentaries
- HoP 1",134
1525,"The second point of importance is found in the subjects which have to be proved, and which have to be made evident; and of these twelve are here given
- HoP 1",158
1527,"We see in this first commencement of reflection, which is quite without order, neither connection nor any totality of determinations
- HoP 1",140
1528,"The second object of knowledge is body; the third, the organs of sensation, as the five outward senses are called
- HoP 1",121
1529,"These are not modifications of consciousness, as the Sanc’hya asserts, but matter constructed out of the elements, which respectively consist of earth, water, light, air, and ether
- HoP 1",188
1531,"The ray of light is usually invisible, just as a light is not seen at mid-day, but in certain circumstances it is visible
- HoP 1",129
1532,"In taste, a watery substance like saliva is the organ, and so on
- HoP 1",72
1533,"We find something similar to what is here said about sight in Plato’s Timæus (pp
- HoP 1",88
1534,"Examples of men seeing at night, so that their eyes lighted up the object, are brought forward in numbers, but the demonstration certainly demands particular conditions
- HoP 1",176
1535,"The objects of sense form the fourth subject
- HoP 1",52
1536,"Here Cesava, a commentator, inserts the categories of Canade, of which there are six
- HoP 1",92
1537,"The first of these is substance, and of this there are nine kinds: earth, water, light, air, ether, time, space, soul, understanding
- HoP 1",140
1540,"The third category is action; the fourth, association of qualities; the fifth, distinction; the sixth, is aggregation, and, according to Canade, this is the last; other writers add negation as the seventh
- HoP 1",212
1541,"This is the manner in which philosophy is regarded by the Indians
- HoP 1",73
1542,"Another topic is regular proof, formal reasoning, or the perfect syllogism (Nyaya), which consists of five propositions:—1, the proposition; 2, the reason; 3, the instance; 4, the application; 5, the conclusion
- HoP 1",218
1543,"To take examples:—1
- HoP 1",27
1544,"This hill is burning; 2, because it smokes; 3, what smokes is burning, like a kitchen fire; 4, accordingly the hill smokes; 5, therefore it is on fire
- HoP 1",158
1545,"This is propounded as syllogisms are with us, but in the manner adopted, the matter which is in point is propounded first
- HoP 1",129
1546,"We should, on the contrary, begin with the general
- HoP 1",58
1547,"This is the ordinary form, and these examples may satisfy us, yet we shall recapitulate the matter once more
- HoP 1",116
1548,"We have seen that in India the point of main importance is the soul’s drawing itself within itself, raising itself up into liberty, or thought, which constitutes itself for itself
- HoP 1",187
1549,"This becoming explicit of soul in the most abstract mode may be called intellectual substantiality, but here it is not the unity of mind and nature that is present, but directly the opposite
- HoP 1",198
1550,"To mind, the consideration of nature is only the vehicle of thought or its exercise, which has as its aim the liberation of mind
- HoP 1",136
1551,"Intellectual substantiality is in India the end, while in Philosophy it is in general the true commencement; to philosophize is the idealism of making thought, in its own right, the principle of truth
- HoP 1",208
1552,"Intellectual substantiality is the opposite of the reflection, understanding, and the subjective individuality of the European
- HoP 1",134
1553,"Intellectual substantiality is the other extreme from this; it is that in which all the subjectivity of the “I” is lost; for it everything objective has become vanity, there is for it no objective truth, duty or right, and thus subjective vanity is the only thing left
- HoP 1",276
1554,"The point of interest is to reach intellectual substantiality in order to drown in it that subjective vanity with all its cleverness and reflection
- HoP 1",155
1555,"This is the advantage of arriving at this point of view
- HoP 1",63
1557,"That intellectual substantiality that thus remaining in abstraction, has as its existence the subjective soul alone
- HoP 1",123
1558,"Just as in empty vanity, where the subjective power of negation alone remains, everything disappears, this abstraction of intellectual substantiality only signifies an escape into what is empty and without determination, wherein everything vanishes
- HoP 1",256
1559,"Therefore what remains to be done is to force forward the real ground of the inwardly self-forming and determining objectivity—the eternal form within itself, which is what men call Thought
- HoP 1",197
1560,"Just as this Thought in the first place, as subjective, is mine, because I think, but in the second place is universality which comprehends intellectual substantiality, it is likewise in the third place forming activity, the principle of determination
- HoP 1",259
1561,"This higher kind of objectivity that unfolds itself, alone gives a place to the particular content, allows it to have free scope and receives it into itself
- HoP 1",164
1562,"If in the Oriental view, the particular shakes and is destined to fall, it still has its place grounded on thought
- HoP 1",122
1563,"It is able to root itself in itself, it is able to stand firm, and this is the hard European understanding
- HoP 1",114
1564,"Such Eastern ideas tend to destroy it, but it is preserved active in the soil of thought; it cannot exist when regarded as independent, but must exist only as a moment in the whole system
- HoP 1",195
1565,"In the Eastern Philosophy we have also discovered a definite content, which is brought under our consideration; but the consideration is destitute of thought or system because it comes from above and is outside of the unity
- HoP 1",231
1566,"On that side there stands intellectual substantiality, on this side it appears dry and barren; the particular thus only has the dead form of simple reason and conclusion, such as we find in the Scholastics
- HoP 1",213
1567,"Based on the ground of thought, on the other hand, the particular may receive its dues; it may be regarded and grasped as a moment in the whole organization
- HoP 1",164
1568,"The Idea has not become objective in the Indian Philosophy; hence the external and objective has not been comprehended in accordance with the Idea
- HoP 1",154
1569,"This is the deficiency in Orientalism
- HoP 1",45
1570,"The true, objective ground of thought finds its basis in the real freedom of the subject; the universal or substantial must itself have objectivity
- HoP 1",155
1572,"It is this principle that we find in the Greek world, and the object of our further consideration is its development
- HoP 1",124
1573,"The universal first appears as quite abstract, and as such it confronts the concrete world; but its value is both for the ground of the concrete world and for that which is implicit
- HoP 1",189
1574,"It is not a beyond, for the value of the present lies in the fact that it exists in the implicit; or that which is implicit, the universal, is the truth of present objects
- HoP 1",179
1575,"PART ONE  GREEK PHILOSOPHY     INTRODUCTION   THE name of Greece strikes home to the hearts of men of education in Europe, and more particularly is this so with us Germans
- HoP 1",179
1576,"Europeans have taken their religion, the life to come, the far-off land, from a point somewhat further off than Greece—they took it from the East, and more especially from Syria
- HoP 1",185
1577,"But the here, the present, art and science, that which in giving liberty to our spiritual life, gives it dignity as it likewise bestows upon it ornament, we know to have proceeded from Greece either directly or indirectly—through the circuitous road of Rome
- HoP 1",265
1578,"The latter of these two ways was the earlier form in which this culture came to us; it also came from the formerly universal church which derived its origin as such from Rome, and has retained its speech even until now
- HoP 1",226
1579,"The sources of authority in addition to the Latin Gospels have been the Fathers
- HoP 1",87
1580,"Our law, too, boasts of deriving its most perfect forms from Rome
- HoP 1",73
1581,"Teutonic strength of mind has required to pass through the hard discipline of the church and law which came to us from Rome, and to be kept in check; it is in this way that the European character first obtained its pliability and capacity for freedom
- HoP 1",258
1582,"Thus it was after European manhood came to be at home with itself and to look upon the present, that the historical and that which is of foreign derivation was given
- HoP 1",173
1583,"Let us leave the Latin and the Roman to the church and to jurisprudence
- HoP 1",79
1584,"Higher, freer philosophic science, as also the beauty of our untrammelled art, the taste for, and love of the same, we know to have taken their root in Greek life and to have created therefrom their spirit
- HoP 1",213
1585,"If we were to have an aspiration, it would be for such a land and such conditions
- HoP 1",89
1586,"But what makes us specially at home with the Greeks is that they made their world their home; the common spirit of homeliness unites us both
- HoP 1",148
1587,"In ordinary life we like best the men and families that are homely and contented in themselves, not desiring what is outside and above them, and so it is with the Greeks
- HoP 1",177
1590,"For their spiritual development requires that which is received or foreign, as matter or stimulus only; in such they have known and borne themselves as men that were free
- HoP 1",178
1591,"The form which they have given to the foreign principle is this characteristic breath of spirituality, the spirit of freedom and of beauty which can in the one aspect be regarded as form, but which in another and higher sense is simply substance
- HoP 1",253
1592,"They have thus not only themselves created the substantial in their culture and made their existence their own, but they have also held in reverence this their spiritual rebirth, which is their real birth
- HoP 1",212
1593,"The foreign origin they have so to speak thanklessly forgotten, putting it in the background—perhaps burying it in the darkness of the mysteries which they have kept secret from themselves
- HoP 1",196
1595,"For their mind, when transformed in this spiritual new birth, is just the living in their life, and also the becoming conscious of that life as it has become actual
- HoP 1",172
1596,"They represent their existence as an object apart from themselves, which manifests itself independently and which in its independence is of value to them; hence they have made for themselves a history of everything which they have possessed and have been
- HoP 1",262
1599,"Philosophy is being at home with self, just like the homeliness of the Greek; it is man’s being at home in his mind, at home with himself
- HoP 1",145
1601,"The development and unfolding of thought has taken place with them from its earliest beginning, and in order to comprehend their Philosophy we may remain with them without requiring to seek for further and external influences
- HoP 1",233
1602,"But we must specify more particularly their character and point of view
- HoP 1",79
1603,"The Greeks have a starting-point in history as truly as they have arisen from out of themselves: this starting-point, comprehended in thought, is the oriental substantiality of the natural unity between the spiritual and the natural
- HoP 1",240
1604,"To start from the self, to live in the self, is the other extreme of abstract subjectivity, when it is still empty, or rather has made itself to be empty; such is pure formalism, the abstract principle of the modern world
- HoP 1",229
1605,"The Greeks stand between both these extremes in the happy medium; this therefore is the medium of beauty, seeing that it is both natural and spiritual, but yet that the spiritual still remains the governing, determining subject
- HoP 1",235
1606,"Mind immersed in nature is in substantial unity with it, and in so far as it is consciousness, it is essentially sensuous perception: as subjective consciousness it is certainly form-giving though it is devoid of measure
- HoP 1",228
1608,"Thus it is a free subject which still possesses that original unity in content, essence and substratum, and fashions its object into beauty
- HoP 1",147
1609,"The stage reached by Greek consciousness is the stage of beauty
- HoP 1",71
1610,"For beauty is the ideal; it is the thought which is derived from Mind, but in such a way that the spiritual individuality is not yet explicit as abstract subjectivity that has then in itself to perfect its existence into a world of thought
- HoP 1",247
1611,"The principle of the spiritual now stands first in rank, and natural existence has no further value for itself, in its existent forms, being the mere expression of the Mind shining through, and having been reduced to be the vehicle and form of its existence
- HoP 1",265
1612,"Mind, however, has not yet got itself as a medium whereby it can represent itself in itself, and from which it can form its world
- HoP 1",137
1613,"Thus free morality could and necessarily did find a place in Greece, for the spiritual substance of freedom was here the principle of morals, laws and constitutions
- HoP 1",172
1614,"Because the natural element is, however, still contained in it, the form taken by the morality of the state is still affected by what is natural; the states are small individuals in their natural condition, which could not unite themselves into one whole
- HoP 1",262
1615,"Since the universal does not exist in independent freedom, that which is spiritual still is limited
- HoP 1",107
1620,"Such thought puts a limit on this wealth of individualities as on the oriental greatness, and reduces it into its one simple soul, which, however, is in itself the first source of the opulence of a higher ideal world, of the world of Thought
- HoP 1",249
1621,"One may add, “out of Thought thou takest the element and material for God” Thus Thought is the ground from which God comes forth, but it is not Thought in its commencement that constitutes the first principle from which all culture must be grasped
- HoP 1",255
1622,"It is quite the other way
- HoP 1",33
1623,"In the beginning, thought comes forth as altogether poor, abstract, and of a content which is meagre in comparison to that given to his subject by the oriental; for as immediate, the beginning is just in the form of nature, and this it shares with what is oriental
- HoP 1",272
1625,"Thus Thought is the Absolute, though not as Thought
- HoP 1",59
1626,"That is, we have always two things to distinguish, the universal or the Notion, and the reality of this universal, for the question here arises as to whether the reality is itself Thought or Nature
- HoP 1",205
1627,"As regards the external and historical condition of Greece at this time, Greek philosophy commences in the sixth century before Christ in the time of Cyrus, and in the period of decline in the Ionic republics in Asia Minor
- HoP 1",230
1628,"Just because this world of beauty which raised itself into a higher kind of culture went to pieces, Philosophy arose
- HoP 1",124
1629,"Crœsus and the Lydians first brought Ionic freedom into jeopardy; later on the Persians were those who destroyed it altogether, so that the greater part of the inhabitants sought other spots and created colonies, more particularly in the West
- HoP 1",250
1630,"At the time of the decline in Ionic towns, the other Greece ceased to be under its ancient lines of kings; the Pelopideans and the other, and for the most part foreign, princely races had passed away
- HoP 1",207
1631,"Greece had in many ways come into touch with the outside world and the Greek inhabitants likewise sought within themselves for a bond of fellowship
- HoP 1",155
1632,"The patriarchal life was past, and in many states it came to be a necessity that they should constitute themselves as free, organized and regulated by law
- HoP 1",162
1635,"Amongst these men just characterized, the seven sages—in modern times excluded from the history of Philosophy—take their place
- HoP 1",134
1636,"In as far as they may be reckoned as milestones in the history of Philosophy, something about their character should, in the commencement of Philosophy, be shortly said
- HoP 1",176
1637,"They came into prominence, partly as taking part in the battles of the Ionic towns, partly as expatriated, and partly as individuals of distinction in Greece
- HoP 1",165
1638,"The names of the seven are given differently: usually, however, as Thales, Solon, Periander, Cleobulus, Chilon, Bias, Pittacus
- HoP 1",134
1639,"Hermippus in Diogenes Laertius (1, 42) specifies seventeen, and, amongst these, various people pick out seven in various ways
- HoP 1",133
1640,"According to Diogenes Laertius (1, 41) Dicæarchus, who came still earlier in history, only names four, and these are placed amongst the seven by all; they are Thales, Bias, Pittacus and Solon
- HoP 1",199
1641,"Besides these, Myson, Anacharsis, Acusilaus, Epimenides, Pherecydes, &c, are mentioned
- HoP 1",94
1642,"Dicæarchus in Diogenes (1, 40), says of them that they are neither wise men (σοφούς) nor philosophers, but men of understanding (συνετξύς) and law-givers; this judgment has become the universal one and is held to be just
- HoP 1",228
1643,"They come in a period of transition amongst the Greeks—a transition from a patriarchal system of kings into one of law or force
- HoP 1",135
1645,"Some of these sayings could not merely be regarded as thoughtful or good reflections, but in so far, as philosophic and speculative; they have a comprehensive, universal significance ascribed to them, which, however, does not explain them
- HoP 1",246
1646,"These men have not really made science and Philosophy their aim; it is expressly said of Thales that it was in the latter part of his life that he first took to Philosophy
- HoP 1",179
1649,"Thales and Bias thus appear as the representatives of the Ionic towns
- HoP 1",77
1650,"However, they did not follow this advice, and this isolated and weakened them, and the result was their conquest; it has always been a difficult thing for the Greeks to give up their individuality
- HoP 1",204
1652,"By so doing they would escape servitude, be happy, and, inhabiting the largest island, subdue the others
- HoP 1",112
1653,"But if they remained in Ionia there was no hope of liberty to be seen for them” Herodotus gives his corroboration to this advice—“If they had followed him they would have been the happiest of Greeks” Such things take place, but through force and not voluntarily
- HoP 1",269
1654,"We find the other sages under similar conditions
- HoP 1",56
1655,"Solon was an administrator in Athens, and thereby became famous; few men have attained the honourable position of being a law-giver
- HoP 1",139
1656,"Solon shares it with Moses, Lycurgus, Zaleucus, Numa, &c, alone
- HoP 1",71
1657,"No individuals can be found amongst Teutonic peoples who possess the distinction of being the law-givers of their people
- HoP 1",128
1660,"Solon was thus not a perfect statesman; this is manifest from the sequel of his history
- HoP 1",95
1661,"A constitution which allowed Pisistratus in Solon’s own time to raise himself into the Tyranny, showing itself to be so destitute of strength and organization that it could not prevent its own overthrow, (and by what a power!)
- HoP 1",234
1662,"This may seem strange, for a constitution must be able to afford resistance to such an attack
- HoP 1",101
1663,"But let us see what Pisistratus did
- HoP 1",43
1664,"What the so-called tyrants really were, is most clearly shown by the relation borne by Solon to Pisistratus
- HoP 1",115
1666,"Most of the law-givers and administrators of states undertook themselves to constrain the people and to be their tyrants
- HoP 1",128
1667,"In states where they did not undertake it, it had to be done by other individuals, for it was essential
- HoP 1",111
1668,"He said, “Men of Athens, I am wiser than some and braver than others: I am wiser than those who do not see the deceit of Pisistratus, braver than those who certainly see it, but say nothing from fear” As he could not do anything, he left Athens
- HoP 1",252
1669,"I have only taken back to myself what the Athenians swore they would preserve to Codrus and his race, and yet took from them
- HoP 1",132
1670,"Moreover I am doing no evil toward gods and men, but as thou hast given laws to the Athenians, I take care (ἐπιτροπῶ) that in civil life they shall carry them out (πολιτεύειν)
- HoP 1",183
1671,"His son Hippias did the same
- HoP 1",36
1673,"Every Athenian gives the tenth part of his revenue, not to me, but towards the cost of the public offering, and besides for the commonwealth, and for use in case of war
- HoP 1",176
1674,"I am not angry that thou hast disclosed my project
- HoP 1",58
1675,"For thou didst it more out of love to the people than hate against me, and because thou didst not know how I would conduct my rule
- HoP 1",138
1676,"For if thou hadst known this, thou wouldst have submitted to it willingly, and wouldst not have taken flight;” and so he goes on
- HoP 1",136
1677,"For he made equality of rights essential in the Athenian constitution, and himself refused the tyranny
- HoP 1",110
1679,"Solon undoubtedly gave the laws, but it is another thing to make such regulations effectual in the manners, habits and life of a people
- HoP 1",143
1680,"What was separate in Solon and Pisistratus, we find united in Periander in Corinth, and Pittacus in Mitilene
- HoP 1",116
1681,"This may be enough about the outward life of the seven sages
- HoP 1",68
1682,"They are also famed for the wisdom of the sayings which have been preserved to us; these sayings seem in great measure, however, to be superficial and hackneyed
- HoP 1",168
1683,"The reason for this is found in the fact that, to our reflection, general propositions are quite usual; much in the Proverbs of Solomon seems to us to be superficial and commonplace for the same reason
- HoP 1",209
1684,"But it is quite another thing to bring to the ordinary conception for the first time this same universal in the form of universality
- HoP 1",140
1685,"Many distichs are ascribed to Solon which we still retain; their object is to express in maxims general obligations towards the gods, the family and the country
- HoP 1",168
1686,"The wisdom of the sages is of this kind; many sayings are insignificant, but many seem to be more insignificant than they are
- HoP 1",133
1687,"For instance, Chilon says: “Stand surety, and evil awaits thee” (ἐγγύα, πάρα δ̓ ἄτα)
- HoP 1",92
1688,"On the one hand this is quite a common rule of life and prudence, but the sceptics gave to this proposition a much higher universal significance, which is also accredited to Chilon
- HoP 1",188
1691,"The result arrived at is this:—“Nobody is to be esteemed happy before his death” But the noteworthy point in this narrative is that from it we can get a better idea of the standpoint of Greek reflection in the time of Solon
- HoP 1",231
1692,"We see that happiness is put forward as the highest aim, that which is most to be desired and which is the end of man; before Kant, morality, as eudæmonism, was based on the determination of happiness
- HoP 1",208
1693,"In Solon’s sayings there is an advance over the sensuous enjoyment which is merely pleasant to the feelings
- HoP 1",115
1695,"But the fact is further to be observed that not every sensuous, immediate pleasure can be laid hold of, for happiness contains a reflection on the circumstances as a whole, in which we have the principle to which the principle of isolated enjoyment must give way
- HoP 1",270
1697,"If we contrast it with Indian philosophy, we find eudæmonism to be antagonistic to it
- HoP 1",93
1698,"There the liberation of the soul from what is corporeal, the perfect abstraction, the necessity that the soul shall, in its simplicity, be at home with itself, is the final end of man
- HoP 1",191
1699,"The stage of reflection that we reach in happiness, stands midway between mere desire and the other extreme, which is right as right and duty as duty
- HoP 1",157
1700,"In happiness, the individual enjoyment has disappeared; the form of universality is there, but the universal does not yet come forth on its own account, and this is the issue of the conversation between Crœsus and Solon
- HoP 1",227
1701,"Man as thinking, is not solely engrossed with present enjoyment, but also with the means for obtaining that to come
- HoP 1",123
1702,"Crœsus points out to him these means, but Solon still objects to the statement of the question of Crœsus
- HoP 1",112
1703,"For in order that any one should be conceived of as happy, we must await his death, for happiness depends upon his condition to the end, and upon the fact that his death should be a pious one and be consistent with his higher destiny
- HoP 1",241
1704,"Because the life of Crœsus had not yet expired, Solon could not deem him happy
- HoP 1",86
1705,"And the history of Crœsus bears evidence that no momentary state deserves the name of happiness
- HoP 1",103
1706,"This edifying history holds in its embrace the whole standpoint of the reflection of that time
- HoP 1",102
1707,"In the consideration of Greek philosophy we have now to distinguish further three important periods:—in the first place the period from Thales to Aristotle; secondly, Greek philosophy in the Roman world; thirdly, the Neo-platonic philosophy
- HoP 1",248
1708,"We begin with thought, as it is in a quite abstract, natural or sensuous form, and we proceed from this to the Idea as determined
- HoP 1",137
1709,"This first period shows the beginning of philosophic thought, and goes on to its development and perfection as a totality of knowledge in itself; this takes place in Aristotle as representing the unity of what has come before
- HoP 1",233
1710,"In Plato there is just such a union of what came earlier, but it is not worked out, for he only represents the Idea generally
- HoP 1",133
1711,"The Neo-platonists have been called eclectics, and Plato was said to have brought about the unity; they were not, however, eclectics, but they had a conscious insight into the necessity for uniting these philosophies
- HoP 1",224
1712,"After the concrete Idea was reached, it came forth as if in opposites, perfecting and developing itself
- HoP 1",111
1713,"The second period is that in which science breaks itself up into different systems
- HoP 1",90
1714,"A one-sided principle is carried through the whole conception of the world; each side is in itself formed into a totality, and stands in the relation of one extreme to another
- HoP 1",183
1715,"The philosophical systems of Stoicism and Epicureanism are such; scepticism forms the negative to their dogmatism, while the other philosophies disappear
- HoP 1",161
1716,"The third period is the affirmative, the withdrawal of the opposition into an ideal world or a world of thought, a divine world
- HoP 1",135
1717,"This is the Idea developed into totality, which yet lacks subjectivity as the infinite being-for-self
- HoP 1",109
1718,"SECTION ONE  FIRST PERIOD, FROM THALES TO ARISTOTLE   IN this first period we shall again make three divisions:—  1
- HoP 1",123
1719,"The first extends from Thales to Anaxagoras, from abstract thought which is in immediate determinateness to the thought of the self-determining Thought
- HoP 1",159
1721,"The second division comprises the Sophists, Socrates, and the followers of Socrates
- HoP 1",91
1723,"The third division, which deals with Plato and Aristotle, is found in Greek science where objective thought, the Idea, forms itself into a whole
- HoP 1",152
1724,"The concrete, in itself determining Thought, is, with Plato, the still abstract Idea, but in the form of universality; while with Aristotle that Idea was conceived of as the self-determining, or in the determination of its efficacy or activity
- HoP 1",251
1725,"CHAPTER I  PERIOD I—DIVISION I—THALES TO ANAXAGORAS   SINCE we possess only traditions and fragments of this epoch, we may speak here of the sources of these
- HoP 1",165
1726,"The first source is found in Plato, who makes copious reference to the older philosophers
- HoP 1",97
1728,"Plato was willing to spend much money in procuring the writings of the older philosophers, and, from his profound study of these, his conclusions have much weight
- HoP 1",170
1730,"In the Parmenides, for instance, we have the Eleatic philosophy, and yet the working out of this doctrine belongs peculiarly to Plato
- HoP 1",141
1732,"Cicero’s name may also occur to us here—although he certainly is but a troubled spring—since he undoubtedly gives us much information; yet because he was lacking in philosophic spirit, he understood Philosophy rather as if it were a matter of history merely
- HoP 1",265
1733,"He does not seem to have himself studied its first sources, and even avows that, for instance, he never understood Heraclitus; and because this old and deep philosophy did not interest him, he did not give himself the trouble to study it
- HoP 1",245
1734,"His information bears principally on later philosophers—the Stoics, Epicureans, the new Academy, and the Peripatetics
- HoP 1",125
1735,"He saw what was ancient through their medium, and, generally speaking, through a medium of reasoning and not of speculation
- HoP 1",131
1736,"Sextus Empiricus, a later sceptic, has importance through his writings, Hypotyposes Pyrrhonicæ and adversus Mathematicos
- HoP 1",128
1738,"The book of Diogenes Laertius (De vitis, &c, Philoss
- HoP 1",60
1739,"A philosophic spirit cannot be ascribed to it; it rambles about amongst bad anecdotes extraneous to the matter in hand
- HoP 1",126
1740,"For the lives of philosophers, and here and there for their tenets, it is useful
- HoP 1",88
1741,"Finally, we must speak of Simplicius, a later Greek, from Cilicia, living under Justinian, in the middle of the sixth century
- HoP 1",133
1742,"He is the most learned and acute of the Greek commentators of Aristotle, and of his writings there is much still unpublished: to him we certainly owe our thanks
- HoP 1",168
1743,"I need give no more references, for they may be found without trouble in any compendium
- HoP 1",95
1745,"But such a connection is in part defective in itself, and in part it is merely external
- HoP 1",95
1746,"The one set of philosophic sects, or of philosophers classed together, which is considered as belonging to a system—that which proceeds from Thales—pursues its course in time and mind far separate from the other
- HoP 1",219
1747,"But, in truth, no such series ever does exist in this isolation, nor would it do so even though the individuals were consecutive and had been externally connected as teacher and taught, which never is the case; mind follows quite another order
- HoP 1",251
1748,"These successive series are interwoven in spirit just as much as in their particular content
- HoP 1",100
1749,"We come across Thales first amongst the Ionic people, to whom the Athenians belonged, or from whom the Ionians of Asia Minor, as a whole, derived their origin
- HoP 1",166
1750,"The Ionic race appears earlier in Peloponnesus, but seems to have been removed from thence
- HoP 1",98
1751,"These two places, Ionia and Greater Greece, are thus the two localities where this first period in the history of Philosophy plays its part until the time when, that period being ended, Philosophy plants itself in Greece proper, and there makes its home
- HoP 1",261
1752,"Those spots were also the seat of early commerce and of an early culture, while Greece itself, so far as these are concerned, followed later
- HoP 1",148
1753,"On the Asia Minor side, and also in the islands, we find Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, Heraclitus, Leucippus, Democritus, Anaxagoras, and Diogenes from Crete
- HoP 1",168
1754,"On the other side are the inhabitants of Italy: Pythagoras from Samos, who lived in Italy, however; Xenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno, Empedocles; and several of the Sophists also lived in Italy
- HoP 1",197
1755,"Anaxagoras was the first to come to Athens, and thus his science takes a middle place between both extremes, and Athens was made its centre
- HoP 1",147
1757,"Those philosophers who turned to the east knew the absolute in a real determination of nature, while towards Italy there is the ideal determination of the absolute
- HoP 1",171
1758,"These explanations will be sufficient for us here; but Empedocles, whom we find in Sicily, is somewhat of a natural philosopher, while Gorgias, the Sicilian sophist, remains faithful to the ideal side
- HoP 1",208
1759,"We now have to consider further:—1, The Ionians, viz Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes; 2, Pythagoras and his followers; 3, the Eleatics, viz Xenophanes, Parmenides, &c; 4, Heraclitus; 5, Empedocles, Leucippus and Democritus; 6, Anaxagoras
- HoP 1",245
1760,"We have to trace and point out the progression of this philosophy also
- HoP 1",78
1761,"The first and altogether abstract determinations are found with Thales and the other Ionians; they grasped the universal in the form of a natural determination, as water and air
- HoP 1",185
1762,"Progression must thus take place by leaving behind the merely natural determination; and we find that this is so with the Pythagoreans
- HoP 1",142
1763,"They say that number is the substance or the essence of things; number is not sensuous, nor is it pure thought, but it is a non-sensuous object of sense
- HoP 1",160
1765,"Heraclitus declares the Absolute to be this very process, which, according to the Eleatics, was still subjective; he arrived at objective consciousness, since in it the Absolute is that which moves or changes
- HoP 1",216
1766,"Empedocles, Leucippus, and Democritus, on the contrary, rather go to the opposite extreme, to the simple, material, stationary principle, to the substratum which underlies the process; and thus this last, as being movement, is distinguished from it
- HoP 1",256
1767,"Here we have the earlier Ionic philosophy, which we desire to treat as shortly as possible; and this is so much the easier, that the thought contained in it is very abstract and barren
- HoP 1",192
1768,"Other philosophers than Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, only come under our consideration as names
- HoP 1",111
1769,"Yet learning prides itself most upon the ancients, for we may be most learned about that of which we know the least
- HoP 1",123

1772,"Thales lived as a statesman partly with Crœsus and partly in Miletus
- HoP 1",76
1773,"It was to the effect that Thales taught the Egyptians to measure the height of their pyramids by shadow—by taking the relation borne by the height of a man to his shadow
- HoP 1",177
1774,"The terms of the proportion are: as the shadow of a man is to the height of a man, so is the shadow of a pyramid to its height
- HoP 1",134
1775,"If this were something new to the Egyptians, they must have been very far back in the theory of geometry
- HoP 1",112
1776,"It is more important that he fixed that the year, as solar year, should have 365 days
- HoP 1",93
1777,"The tripod was given to Thales or to Bias; Thales gave it to some one else, and thus it went through a circle until it again came to Thales; the latter, or else Solon, decided that Apollo was wisest, and sent it to Didyma or to Delphi

1781,"In the passage of most importance (Metaph

- HoP 1",238
1785,"For instance, we say that, absolutely speaking, Socrates neither originates if he becomes beautiful or musical, nor does he pass away if he loses these qualities, because the subject (τὸ ὑποκείμενον), Socrates, remains the same
- HoP 1",235
1786,"And so it is with all else
- HoP 1",34
1787,"For there must be one nature, or more than one, from which all else arises, because it maintains its existence” (σωζομένης ἐκείνης), that means that in its change there is no reality or truth
- HoP 1",199
1788,"But as to this we must say that of Thales in particular, we know nothing more than his principle, which is that water is the god over all
- HoP 1",145
1789,"No more do we know anything further of Anaximander, Anaximenes and Diogenes than their principles
- HoP 1",105
1791,"But that from which anything generates is the principle of all things
- HoP 1",77
1793,"And furthermore, they can hardly be called grounds, for what Aristotle does is rather to establish, as we would say from actuality, that the latter corresponds to the universal idea of water

1797,"They made Oceanus and Tethys the producers of all origination (τῆς γενέσεως), and water, which by the poets is called Styx, the oath of the gods
- HoP 1",152
1798,"For what is most ancient is most revered, and the oath is that most held in reverence” This old tradition has within it speculative significance
- HoP 1",152
1799,"If anything cannot be proved or is devoid of objective form, such as we have in respect of payment in a discharge, or in witnesses who have seen the transaction, the oath, the confirmation of myself as object, expresses the fact that my assurance is absolute truth
- HoP 1",272
1801,"The closer consideration of this principle in its bearings would have no interest
- HoP 1",89
1802,"For since the whole philosophy of Thales lies in the fact that water is this principle, the only point of interest can be to ask how far that principle is important and speculative
- HoP 1",188
1803,"Thales comprehends essence as devoid of form
- HoP 1",52
1805,"Fluid is, in its Notion, life, and hence it is water itself, spiritually expressed; in the so-called grounds or reasons, on the contrary, water has the form of existent universal
- HoP 1",186
1807,"Water thus has not got a sensuous universality, but a speculative one merely; to be speculative universality, however, would necessitate its being Notion and having what is sensuous removed
- HoP 1",197
1808,"Here we have the strife between sensuous universality and universality of the Notion
- HoP 1",92
1809,"The real essence of nature has to be defined, that is, nature has to be expressed as the simple essence of thought
- HoP 1",122
1810,"Now simple essence, the Notion of the universal, is that which is devoid of form, but this water as it is, comes into the determination of form, and is thus, in relation to others, a particular existence just like everything that is natural
- HoP 1",248
1811,"Yet as regards the other elements, water is determined as formless and simple, while the earth is that which has points, air is the element of all change, and fire evidently changes into itself
- HoP 1",201
1812,"Now if the need of unity impels us to recognize for separate things a universal, water, although it has the drawback of being a particular thing, can easily be utilized as the One, both on account of its neutrality, and because it is more material than air
- HoP 1",264
1813,"The proposition of Thales, that water is the Absolute, or as the ancients say, the principle, is the beginning of Philosophy, because with it the consciousness is arrived at that essence, truth, that which is alone in and for itself, are one
- HoP 1",249
1814,"A departure from what is in our sensuous perception here takes place; man recedes from this immediate existence
- HoP 1",119

- HoP 1",128
1817,"The imagination has, indeed, its gods, but its content still is natural; the Greeks had considered sun, mountains, earth, sea, rivers, &c, as independent powers, revered them as gods, and elevated them by the imagination to activity, movement, consciousness and will
- HoP 1",274
1820,"This universal stands in direct relationship to the particular and to the existence of the world as manifested
- HoP 1",118
1821,"The first thing implied in what has been said, is that the particular existence has no independence, is not true in and for itself, but is only an accidental modification
- HoP 1",178
1823,"It is similarly the case that all particular existence is transient, that is, it loses the form of particular and again becomes the universal, water
- HoP 1",156
1824,"The simple proposition of Thales therefore, is Philosophy, because in it water, though sensuous, is not looked at in its particularity as opposed to other natural things, but as Thought in which everything is resolved and comprehended
- HoP 1",242
1825,"Thus we approach the divorce of the absolute from the finite; but it is not to be thought that the unity stands above, and that down here we have the finite world
- HoP 1",170
1826,"This idea is often found in the common conception of God—where permanence is attributed to the world and where men often represent two kinds of actuality to themselves, a sensuous and a supersensuous world of equal standing
- HoP 1",231
1827,"The philosophic point of view is that the one is alone the truly actual, and here we must take actual in its higher significance, because we call everything actual in common life
- HoP 1",186
1828,"The second circumstance to be remembered is that with the ancient philosophers, the principle has a definite and, at first, a physical form
- HoP 1",147
1829,"To us this does not appear to be philosophic but only physical; in this case, however, matter has philosophic significance
- HoP 1",130
1830,"Thales’ theory is thus a natural philosophy, because this universal essence is determined as real; consequently the Absolute is determined as the unity of thought and Being
- HoP 1",180
1831,"Now if we have this undifferentiated principle predominating, the question arises as to the determination of this first principle
- HoP 1",137
1832,"The transition from universal to particular at once becomes essential, and it begins with the determination of activity; the necessity for such arises here
- HoP 1",163
1833,"That which is to be a veritable principle must not have a one-sided, particular form, but in it the difference must itself be absolute, while other principles are only special kinds of forms
- HoP 1",198
1834,"The fact that the Absolute is what determines itself is already more concrete; we have the activity and the higher self-consciousness of the spiritual principle, by which the form has worked itself into being absolute form, the totality of form
- HoP 1",252
1835,"Since it is most profound, this comes latest; what has first to be done is merely to look at things as determined
- HoP 1",121
1836,"Form is lacking to water as conceived by Thales
- HoP 1",55
1837,"How is this accorded to it?

- HoP 1",77
1842,"Difference as regards the Notion has no physical significance, but differences or the simple duality of form in the sides of its opposition, must be comprehended as universally in the Notion
- HoP 1",198
1844,"As sensuous difference or change, the division here appears as something manifested for consciousness; the moderns have experimented in making thicker and thinner what to the senses is the same
- HoP 1",201
1845,"Change has consequently a double sense; one with reference to existence and another with reference to the Notion
- HoP 1",120
1847,"But what is meant in all ancient philosophies is change as regards the Notion
- HoP 1",85
1849,"As regards merely empirical existence, it may easily be shown that each quality exists on its own account, but in the Notion they only are, through one another, and by virtue of an inward necessity
- HoP 1",205
1850,"We certainly see this also in living matter, where things happen in another way, for here the Notion comes into existence; thus if, for example, we abstract the heart, the lungs and all else collapse
- HoP 1",207
1851,"And in the same way all nature exists only in the unity of all its parts, just as the brain can exist only in unity with the other organs
- HoP 1",145
1852,"If the form is, however, only expressed in both its sides as condensation and rarefaction, it is not in and for itself, for to be this it must be grasped as the absolute Notion, and as an endlessly forming unity

1859,"The Theism of Thales is maintained by Plouquet, whilst others would have him to be an atheist or polytheist, because he says that everything is full of demons
- HoP 1",166
1860,"However, this question as to whether Thales believed in God does not concern us here, for acceptation, faith, popular religion are not in question; we only have to do with the philosophic determination of absolute existence
- HoP 1",231
1862,"Similarly the word world-soul is useless, because its being is not thereby expressed
- HoP 1",92
1863,"Thus all these further, as also later, assertions do not justify us in maintaining that Thales comprehended form in the absolute in a definite manner; on the contrary, the rest of the history of philosophical development refutes this view
- HoP 1",246
1864,"We see that form certainly seems to be shown forth in existence, but as yet this unity is no further developed
- HoP 1",118
1865,"The idea that the magnet has a soul is indeed always better than saying that it has the power of attraction; for power is a quality which is considered as a predicate separable from matter, while soul is movement in unison with matter in its essence
- HoP 1",257
1866,"An idea such as this of Thales stands isolated, however, and has no further relation to his absolute thought
- HoP 1",116
1867,"Thus, in fact, the philosophy of Thales is comprised in the following simple elements: (a) It has constituted an abstraction in order to comprehend nature in a simple sensuous essence

- HoP 1",124
2202,"If we want to know what tone any string has, we have only to consider its tension, and this may be measured by the weight depending from the string, by means of which it is extended
- HoP 1",189
2204,"In the first case, the more distended string makes as many vibrations again as the other; in the second case, it makes three vibrations for the other’s two, and so it goes on
- HoP 1",182
2205,"Here number is the real factor which determines the difference, for tone, as the vibration of a body, is only a quantitatively determined quiver or movement, that is, a determination made through space and time
- HoP 1",218

2225,"The Pythagoreans say, according to the last quoted passage of Aristotle, that we do not hear it because we live in it, like the smith who gets accustomed to the blows of his hammer
- HoP 1",188
2226,"Since it belongs to our substance and is identical with ourselves, nothing else, such as silence, by which we might know the other, comes into relationship with us, for we are conceived of as entirely within the movement

2330,"Being, the One of the Eleatic school, is just this immersion in the abyss of the abstract identity of the understanding
- HoP 1",127
2331,"Just as this comes first, so it also comes last, as that to which the understanding comes back, and this is proved in recent times when God is grasped only as the highest Being
- HoP 1",184
2332,"If we say of God that this the highest Being is outside of and over us, we can know nothing more of it but that it is, and thus it is the undetermined; for if we knew of determinations, this would be to possess knowledge

2334,"Modern thought has, indeed, passed through a longer path, not only through what is sensuous, but also through philosophic ideas and predicates of God, to this all negating abstraction; but the content, the result arrived at is the same

2339,"Thus were there several, they would be relatively more powerful or weaker, and thus they would not be gods, for God’s nature is to have nothing mightier than He

2343,"Since He is eternal and one and spherical in form, He is neither unlimited nor limited
- HoP 1",94
2344,"To be unlimited is non-being; for that has neither middle, beginning, end, nor part; and what is unlimited corresponds to this description

- HoP 1",146

- HoP 1",106

2366,"We here find in Xenophanes a double consciousness; a pure consciousness and consciousness of Being, and a consciousness of opinion
- HoP 1",138
2367,"The former was to him the consciousness of the divine, and it is the pure dialectic, which is negatively related to all that is determined and which annuls it

- HoP 1",176
2537,"Both of these, however, are, in space and time, placed in one; space and time are thus the contradiction; it is necessary, first of all, to show the contradiction in movement, for in movement that which is opposed is, to ordinary conceptions, inevitably manifested

2697,"In this connection, it is in some accounts63 said of Heraclitus that he defined it thus: “Of the forms taken by fire there is first of all the sea, and then of it half is the earth and the other half the lightning flash (πρηστήρ),” the fire which springs up

2896,"But what is this to me—as though ‘twere anything   By art to conquer much corrupted man”  But, taken in the context, this laudation means that I am highly honoured, but what is the value of that to me; it expresses weariness of the honour given him by men

2897,"Empedocles had Pythagoreans as pupils, and went about with them; he is sometimes considered to have been a Pythagorean like Parmenides and Zeno, but this is the only ground for such a statement
- HoP 1",201
2898,"It is a question whether he belonged to the League; his philosophy has no resemblance to the Pythagorean
- HoP 1",112
2900,"Empedocles is more poetic than definitely philosophical; he is not very interesting, and much cannot be made of his philosophy
- HoP 1",134
2901,"As to the particular Notion which governs it, and which really begins in it to appear, we may call it Combination or Synthesis
- HoP 1",134
2902,"It is as combination that the unity of opposites first presents itself; this Notion, first opening up with Heraclitus, is, while in a condition of rest, conceived of as combination, before thought grasps the universal in Anaxagoras
- HoP 1",239
2903,"Empedocles’ synthesis, as a completion of the relationship, thus belongs to Heraclitus, whose speculative Idea, though in reality, is process, but this is so without the individual moments in reality being mutually related as Notions
- HoP 1",241
2904,"Empedocles’ conception of synthesis holds good to the present day
- HoP 1",73
2906,"I will now give Empedocles’ ideas shortly, and draw the many units mentioned into the connection of a whole
- HoP 1",115
2908,"But with Empedocles this undoubtedly is the case: every particular thing arises through some kind of union of the four
- HoP 1",126
2909,"These four elements, to our ordinary idea, are not so many sensuous things if we consider them as universal elements; for, looked at sensuously, there are various other sensuous things
- HoP 1",192
2910,"All that is organic, for example, is of another kind; and, further, earth as one, as simple, pure earth, does not exist, for it is in manifold determinateness
- HoP 1",166
2911,"In the idea of four elements we have the elevation of sensuous ideas into thought
- HoP 1",89
2912,"Aristotle further says in reference to the abstract Notion of their relation to one another (Met
- HoP 1",104
2913,"He has the four natural elements as the real, and friendship and strife as the ideal principles, so that six elements, of which Sextus76 often speaks, make their appearance in lines that Aristotle (Met
- HoP 1",209
2914,"There we have the idea that spirit, the soul, is itself the unity, the very totality of elements, in which the principle of earth relates to earth, water to water, love to love, &c77 In seeing fire, the fire is in us for whom objective fire is, and so on
- HoP 1",262
2915,"Empedocles also speaks of the process of these elements, but he did not comprehend it further; the point to be remarked is that he represented their unity as a combination
- HoP 1",179
2918,"For example, the nature of an animal is its constant and real determinateness, its kind, its universality, which is simple
- HoP 1",130
2919,"But Empedocles does away with nature in this sense, for every thing, according to him, is the combination of simple elements, and thus not in itself the universal, simple and true: this is not what is signified by us when we speak of nature
- HoP 1",248
2920,"Now this nature in which a thing moves in accordance with its own end, Aristotle (De gen et corr
- HoP 1",104
2921,"Because the elements were thus existent simply in themselves, there was, properly speaking, no process established in them, for in process they are only vanishing moments, and not existent in themselves
- HoP 1",210
2922,"Being thus implicit, they must have been unchangeable, or they could not constitute themselves into a unity; for in the one their subsistence, or their implicit existence would be destroyed
- HoP 1",197
2923,"But because Empedocles says that things subsist from these elements, he immediately establishes their unity
- HoP 1",115
2924,"These are the principal points in Empedocles’ philosophy
- HoP 1",64
2925,"I will quote the remarks that Aristotle (Met
- HoP 1",52
2926,"But this is only the Notion, or the thought which is present in and for itself; we have not yet seen such a principle, for we find it first in Anaxagoras
- HoP 1",161
2927,"If Aristotle found the principle of motion missed in ancient philosophers, in the Becoming of Heraclitus, he again missed in Heraclitus the still deeper principle of the Good, and hence wished to discover it in Empedocles
- HoP 1",229
2929,"Aristotle thus entirely controverts Heraclitus, because his principle is change alone, without remaining like self, maintaining self, and going back within self
- HoP 1",168
2931,"This is the case generally with all determinateness, that it must in itself be the opposite, and must manifest itself as such
- HoP 1",133
2932,"The remark that, speaking generally, there is no union without separation, no separation without union, is a profound one; identity and non-identity are thought-determinations of this kind which cannot be separated
- HoP 1",222
2933,"The reproach made by Aristotle is one that lies in the nature of the thing
- HoP 1",82
2935,"For at one time he maintains that none of the elements springs out of the other, but all else comes from them; and, at another time, he makes them into a whole through friendship, and again destroys this unity through strife
- HoP 1",232
2936,"Thus through particular differences and qualities, one becomes water, the other fire, &c Now if the particular differences are taken away (and they can be taken away since they have arisen), it is evident that water arises from earth, and the reverse

- HoP 1",177
2939,"Aristotle says of Anaxagoras (Met
- HoP 1",41
2941,"The connection of his philosophy with what precedes is as follows: In Heraclitus’ Idea as motion, all moments are absolutely vanishing
- HoP 1",142
2942,"Empedocles represents the gathering together of this motion into a unity, but into a synthetic unity; and with Leucippus and Democritus it is the same
- HoP 1",158
2943,"With Empedocles, however, the moments of this unity are the existent elements of fire, water, &c, and with the others, pure abstractions, implicit being, thoughts
- HoP 1",170
2944,"But in this way universality is directly asserted, for the opposing elements have no longer any sensuous support
- HoP 1",120
2945,"Anaxagoras now says that it is not gods, sensuous principles, elements, or thoughts—which really are determinations of reflection—but that it is the Universal, Thought itself, in and for itself, without opposition, all embracing, which is the substance or the principle
- HoP 1",277
2946,"The unity as universal, returns from the opposition into itself, while in the synthesis of Empedocles, what is opposed is still apart from it and independent, and Thought is not Being
- HoP 1",191
2947,"Here, however, Thought as pure, free process in itself, is the self-determining universal, and is not distinguished from conscious thought
- HoP 1",146

2961,"Athens, after the Persian wars, brought the greater part of the Greek islands into subjection, as also a number of maritime towns in Thrace, and even further into the Black Sea
- HoP 1",184

- HoP 1",229
2967,"In Lacedæmon personality proper was so much disregarded that the individual could not have free development or expression; individuality was not recognized, and hence not brought into harmony with the common end of the State
- HoP 1",232
2968,"This abrogation of the rights of subjectivity, which, expressed in his own way, is also found in Plato’s Republic, was carried very far with the Lacedæmonians
- HoP 1",166
2969,"But the universal is living spirit only in so far as the individual consciousness finds itself as such within it; the universal is not constituted of the immediate life and being of the individual, the mere substance, but formed of conscious life
- HoP 1",254
2970,"As individuality which separates itself from the universal is powerless and falls to the ground, the one-sided universal, the morality of individuality cannot stand firm
- HoP 1",177
2972,"This essential moment of particularity, not being taken into the State, and hence not made legal and moral (moral first of all), comes forth as vice
- HoP 1",156
2973,"In a rational organization all the elements of the Idea are present; if the liver were isolated as bile it would become not more, and not less active, but becoming antagonistic, it would isolate itself from the corporate economy of the body
- HoP 1",248
2975,"Solon entrusted the executive to the people, not to the Ephors, and this became self-government after the displacement of the tyrants, and thus in truth a free people arose; the individual had the whole within himself, as he had his consciousness and action in the whole
- HoP 1",278
2976,"Thus we see in this principle the formation of free consciousness and the freedom of individuality in its greatness
- HoP 1",123
2979,"Thus we do not see the carrying out of isolated ideas, but the great, moral, solid, divine content made in these works object for consciousness, and generally brought before consciousness

2982,"But amongst this noble, free, and cultured people of Athens, he who had the happiness to be first, was Pericles, and this circumstance raised him in the estimation of the individual to a place so high that few could reach it
- HoP 1",232
2983,"Of all that is great amongst men, the power of ruling over the will of men who have but one will, is the greatest, for this controlling individuality must be both the most universal and the most living—a lot for a mortal being than which hardly any better can be found

- HoP 1",95
2990,"When Anaxagoras at this time, the principle of which has just been given, came to Athens, he was sought out by Pericles, and, as his friend, lived in very intimate relations with him, before the latter occupied himself with public affairs

2991,"But Plutarch (in Pericle 4, 16) also relates that Anaxagoras came to want because Pericles neglected him—did not supply the illuminating lamp with oil

2998,"Innocent and childlike it may certainly have been, but reason is just the going forth from such innocence and unity with nature
- HoP 1",135
2999,"So soon as mind grasps itself, is for itself, it must for that very reason confront the ‘other’ of itself as a negation of consciousness, ie look on it as something devoid of mind, an unconscious and lifeless thing, and it must first come to itself through this opposition

3010,"The logical principle of Anaxagoras was that he recognized the νοῦς as the simple, absolute essence of the world
- HoP 1",120
3011,"The simplicity of the νοῦς is not a Being but a universality which is distinguished from itself, though in such a way that the distinction is immediately sublated and the identity is set forth for itself
- HoP 1",211
3012,"This universal for itself, sundered, exists in purity only as thought; it exists also in nature as objective existence, but in that case no longer purely for itself, but as having particularity as an immediate in it

- HoP 1",138
3016,"Here the speculative unity of this universal with the individual should be considered as it is posited as absolute unity, but the comprehension of the Notion itself is certainly not found with the ancients
- HoP 1",213
3017,"We need not expect a pure Notion such as one of an understanding realizing itself into a system, organized as a universe

3018,"How Anaxagoras enunciated the Notion of the νοῦς, Aristotle (De anim
- HoP 1",76
3019,"Yet he does not always express himself fully about the soul and νοῦς: he seems to separate νοῦς and soul from one another, and still he makes use of them as though they were the same existence, only that by preference he makes the νοῦς the principle of everything
- HoP 1",271
3020,"He certainly speaks frequently of the νοῦς as of the cause of the beautiful and right, but another time he calls it the soul
- HoP 1",132
3021,"As soul, the self-moving is only immediately individual; the νοῦς, however, as simple, is the universal
- HoP 1",111
3022,"Thought moves on account of something: the end is the first simple which makes itself result; this principle with the ancients is grasped as good and evil, ie end as positive and negative
- HoP 1",195
3023,"This determination is a very important one, but with Anaxagoras it was not fully worked out
- HoP 1",99
3024,"While in the first place the principles are material, from these Aristotle then distinguishes determination and form, and thirdly he finds in the process of Heraclitus, the principle of motion
- HoP 1",200
3025,"Then in the fourth place there comes the reason why, the determination of end, with the νοῦς; this is the concrete in itself
- HoP 1",132
3028,"With this principle comes the determination of an understanding as of self-determining activity; this has hitherto been wanting, for the Becoming of Heraclitus, which is only process, is not yet as fate, the independently self-determining
- HoP 1",246
3029,"By this we must not represent to ourselves subjective thought; in thinking we think immediately of our thought as it is in consciousness
- HoP 1",144
3030,"Here, on the contrary, quite objective thought is meant, active understanding—as we say, there is reason in the world, or we speak of genera in nature which are the universal
- HoP 1",182
3031,"The genus animal is the substantial of the dog; the dog itself is this; the laws of nature are themselves nature’s immanent essence
- HoP 1",139
3032,"The nature is not formed from without as men make a table; this is also made with understanding, but through an understanding outside of this wood
- HoP 1",154
3033,"This external form, which is called the understanding, immediately occurs to us in speaking of the understanding; but here the universal is meant, that which is the immanent nature of the object itself
- HoP 1",209
3034,"The νοῦς is thus not a thinking existence from without which regulates the world; by such the meaning present to Anaxagoras would be quite destroyed and all its philosophic interest taken away
- HoP 1",200
3035,"For to speak of an individual, a unit from without, is to fall into the ordinary conception and its dualism; a so-called thinking principle is no longer a thought, but is a subject
- HoP 1",188
3036,"But still the true universal is for all that not abstract, but the universal is just the determining in and out of itself of the particular in and for itself
- HoP 1",165
3037,"In this activity, which is independently self-determining, the fact is at once implied that the activity, because it constitutes process, retains itself as the universal self-identical
- HoP 1",192
3039,"This relation to itself in determination which we see appearing in Anaxagoras, now, however, contains the determination of the universal though it is not formally expressed, and therein we have the end or the Good
- HoP 1",221
3040,"I have just recently (p 316) spoken of the Notion of the end, yet by that we must not merely think of the form of the end as it is in us, in conscious beings
- HoP 1",165
3041,"At first, end, in as far as I have it, is my conception, which is for itself, and the realization of which depends on my wish; if I carry it out, and if I am not unskilful, the object produced must be conformable to the end, containing nothing but it
- HoP 1",258
3042,"There is a transition from subjectivity to objectivity through which this opposition is always again sublated
- HoP 1",117
3043,"Because I am discontented with my end in that it is only subjective, my activity consists in removing this defect and making it objective
- HoP 1",145
3044,"In objectivity the end has retained itself; for instance, if I have the end in view of building a house and am active for that end, the house results in which my end is realized
- HoP 1",185
3045,"But we must not, as we usually do, abide at the conception of this subjective end; in this case both I and the end exist independently and externally in relation to each other
- HoP 1",183
3046,"In the conception that God, as wisdom, rules the world in accordance with an end, for instance, the end is posited for itself in a wise, figuratively conceiving Being
- HoP 1",174
3047,"But the universal of end is the fact that since it is a determination independently fixed, that rules present existence, the end is the truth, the soul of a thing
- HoP 1",170
3048,"The Good in the end gives content to itself, so that while it is active with this content, and after it has entered into externality, no other content comes forth than what was already present
- HoP 1",200
3049,"The best example of this is presented in life; it has desires, and these desires are its ends; as merely living, however, it knows nothing of these ends, but yet they are first, immediate determinations which are established
- HoP 1",232
3050,"The animal works at satisfying these desires, ie at reaching the end; it relates itself to external things, partly mechanically, partly chemically
- HoP 1",154
3051,"But the character of its activity does not remain mechanical or chemical; the product is rather the animal itself, which, as its own end, brings forth in its activity only itself, since it negates and overturns those mechanical or chemical relationships
- HoP 1",261
3052,"In mechanical and chemical process, on the other hand, the result is something different, in which the subject does not retain itself; but in the end, beginning and end are alike, for we posit the subjective objectively in order to receive it again
- HoP 1",256
3053,"Self-preservation is a continual production by which nothing new, but always the old, arises; it is a taking back of activity for the production of itself
- HoP 1",162
3054,"Thus this self-determining activity, which is then active on something else, enters into opposition, but it again negates the opposition, governs it, in it reflects upon itself; it is the end, the thought, that which conserves itself in its self-determination
- HoP 1",267
3055,"The development of these moments is the business of Philosophy from henceforth
- HoP 1",86
3056,"But if we look more closely as to how far Anaxagoras has got in the development of this thought, we find nothing further than the activity determining from out of itself, which sets up a limit or measure; further than the determination of measure, development does not go
- HoP 1",279
3057,"Anaxagoras gives us no more concrete definition of the νοῦς, and this we are still left to consider; we thus have nothing more than the abstract determination of the concrete in itself
- HoP 1",192
3058,"The above-mentioned predicates which Anaxagoras gives the νοῦς, may thus indeed be affirmed, but they are, on their own account, one-sided only
- HoP 1",151
3059,"This is the one side in the principle of Anaxagoras; we now have to consider the going forth of the νοῦς into further determinations
- HoP 1",140
3060,"This remaining part of the philosophy of Anaxagoras at first, however, makes us think that the hopes in which such a principle justified us must be very much diminished
- HoP 1",176
3061,"On the other side, this universal is confronted by Being, matter, the manifold generally, potentiality as distinguished from the former as actuality
- HoP 1",156
3062,"For if the Good or the end is also determined as potentiality, the universal, as the self-moving, may rather be called the actual in itself, the being-for-self, as opposed to implicit being, potentiality, passivity
- HoP 1",222
3063,"Aristotle says in an important passage (Met
- HoP 1",51
3064,"But where nothing is yet separated, no distinguishing feature is present; such substance is neither a white, black, gray, nor any other colour, but colourless; it has no quality nor quantity nor determination (τί)
- HoP 1",221
3065,"All is mingled except the νοῦς; this is unmingled and pure
- HoP 1",66
3067,"For the latter takes as original principles, fire, air, earth, and water, through whose union all things arise
- HoP 1",118
3068,"On the other hand, Anaxagoras maintains what are of like parts such as flesh, bones, or the like to be simple materials; such things as water and fire, on the contrary, are a mixture of the original elements
- HoP 1",215
3071,"But to Anaxagoras with whom the elements are a mingled chaos formed therefrom, having only an apparent uniformity, concrete things arise through the severance of these infinitely many principles from such a chaos, since like finds like
- HoP 1",243
3074,"That comes near our ordinary ideas
- HoP 1",42
3075,"Means of nourishment, it is thought, contain such parts as are homogeneous to blood, flesh, &c Anaxagoras hence says, according to Aristotle (De gen anim
- HoP 1",161
3076,"The activity of the νοῦς, as the sundering of the like out of the chaos and the putting together of the like, as also the setting at liberty again of this like, is certainly simple and relative to itself, but purely formal and thus for itself contentless
- HoP 1",262
3078,"It also says that much is only relatively simple, eg platinum consists of three or four metals
- HoP 1",102
3079,"Water and air were similarly long held to be simple, but chemistry at length analyzed them
- HoP 1",98
3080,"From this chemical point of view, the simple principles of natural things are determined as infinitely qualitative and thus accepted as unchangeable and invariable, so that all else consists only of the combination of these simples
- HoP 1",239
3081,"Man, according to this, is a collection of carbon and hydrogen, some earth, oxides, phosphorus, &c It is a favourite idea of the physicists to place in the water or in the air, oxygen and carbon, which exist and only require to be separated
- HoP 1",248
3082,"This idea of Anaxagoras certainly also differs from modern chemistry; that which we consider as concrete, is for him qualitatively determined or elementary
- HoP 1",163
3083,"Yet he allows, with regard to flesh, that the parts are not all alike
- HoP 1",77
3085,"While he defines absolute existence as universal, we see here that in objective existence, or in matter, universality and thought abandon Anaxagoras

3091,"This may suffice us; however easily we may get confused with the homœomeriæ of Anaxagoras, we must hold fast to the main determination
- HoP 1",142
3092,"The homœomeriæ still form a striking conception, and it may be asked how it conforms with the rest of Anaxagoras’ principle
- HoP 1",131
3093,"Now as to the relation of the νοῦς to that matter, both are not speculatively posited as one, for the relation itself is not set forth as one, nor has the Notion penetrated it
- HoP 1",183
3094,"Here the ideas become in some measure superficial, and in some measure the conceptions are more consistent as regards the particular, than they at first appear
- HoP 1",167
3095,"Because the understanding is the self-determining, the content is end, it retains itself in relation to what is different; it does not arise and pass away although it is in activity
- HoP 1",189
3096,"The conception of Anaxagoras that concrete principles subsist and retain themselves, is thus consistent; he abolishes arising and passing away and accepts only an external change, a uniting together, and a severance of what is so united
- HoP 1",244
3097,"The principles are concrete and have content, ie so many ends; in the change that takes place the principles really retain themselves
- HoP 1",141
3098,"Like only goes with like even if the chaotic mixture is a combination of the unlike; but this is only a combination and not an individual, living form which maintains itself, binding like to like
- HoP 1",203
3099,"Thus, however rude these ideas are, they are still really in harmony with the νοῦς
- HoP 1",90
3100,"But if the νοῦς is with Anaxagoras the moving soul in all, it yet remains to the real, as the soul of the world and the organic system of the whole, a mere word
- HoP 1",168
3102,"Anaxagoras calls the understanding such a principle, and in fact the absolute Notion, as simple existence, the self-identical in its differences, the dividing, the reality-establishing, must be known as such
- HoP 1",215
3104,"By this we are shown no more of the realization of this reason or the comprehensibility of the world
- HoP 1",108
3105,"The νοῦς of Anaxagoras is thus still formal, although the identity of the principle with the realization was recognized
- HoP 1",127
3106,"Socrates, according to Plato, states most definitely both what the absolute to them was, and why Anaxagoras did not satisfy them
- HoP 1",136
3107,"I quote this because it will best of all lead us on to the main conception which we recognize in the philosophic consciousness of the ancients; at the same time it is an example of the loquacity of Socrates
- HoP 1",214
3108,"Socrates’ understanding of the νοῦς as end is better because its determinations are congenial to him, so that we also see in it the principal forms that appear in Socrates
- HoP 1",179
3109,"It is further said, “For this reason a man has only to consider for himself, as for all others, what is best and most perfect, and then he would of necessity know the worse, for the same science comprises both
- HoP 1",217
3111,"Because he assigned its cause to each and to all in common, I thought that he would explain what was best for each and what was best for all” (the free, implicitly and explicitly existent Idea, the absolute end)
- HoP 1",219
3114,"Anaxagoras seems to define an end and to wish to proceed from it; but he immediately lets this go again and proceeds to quite external causes
- HoP 1",149
3115,"If, however, anyone were to say that without having bones and muscles and whatever else I have, I could not do that which I consider best, he would be quite right
- HoP 1",170
3117,"This is a good example for showing that we miss the end in such modes of explanation
- HoP 1",92
3118,"On the other hand, it is not a good example, because it is taken from the kingdom of the self-conscious will, where deliberate and not unconscious end reigns
- HoP 1",165
3119,"In this criticism of the Anaxagorean νοῦς we can certainly see it generally expressed that Anaxagoras made no application of his νοῦς to reality
- HoP 1",152
3120,"But the positive element in the conclusion of Socrates seems, on the other hand, to be unsatisfying, because it goes to the other extreme, namely, to desire causes for nature which do not appear to be in it, but which fall outside of it in consciousness
- HoP 1",261
3121,"For what is good and beautiful is partly due to the thought of consciousness as such; end or purposive action is mainly an act of consciousness and not of nature
- HoP 1",169
3125,"Thus presented, the end, the Good, lies outside of the thing itself: the nature of a thing then becomes considered, not in and for itself, but only in relation to another which is nothing to it
- HoP 1",201
3126,"Thus, because things are only useful for an end, this determination is not their own but one foreign to them
- HoP 1",116
3128,"But this to us familiar way of regarding the good and expedient is on the one hand not the only one, and does not represent Plato’s meaning, while, on the other, it is likewise necessary
- HoP 1",194
3129,"The nature of things must be recognized in accordance with the Notion, which is the independent, unfettered consideration of things; and because it is that which things are in and for themselves, it controls the relationship of natural causes
- HoP 1",250
3131,"Becoming is the movement through which a reality or totality becomes; in the animal or plant its essence as universal genus, is that which begins its movement and brings it forth
- HoP 1",186
3132,"But this whole is not the product of something foreign, but its own product, what is already present as germ or seed; thus it is called end, the self-producing, that which in its Becoming is already implicitly existent
- HoP 1",226
3133,"The Idea is not a particular thing, which might have another content than reality or appear quite different
- HoP 1",115
3134,"The opposition is the merely formal opposition of possibility and actuality; the active impelling substance and the product are the same
- HoP 1",144
3135,"This realization goes right through the opposition; the negative in the universal is just this process
- HoP 1",110
3136,"The genus sets itself in a state of opposition as individual and universal, and thus, in what lives, the genus realizes itself in the opposition of races which are opposed, but whose principle is the universal genus
- HoP 1",223
3137,"They, as individuals, aim at their own self-preservation as individuals in eating, drinking, &c, but what they thereby bring to pass is genus
- HoP 1",149
3138,"Individuals sublate themselves, but genus is that which is ever brought forth; plants bring forth only the same plants whose ground is the universal
- HoP 1",156
3139,"In accordance with this, the distinction between what have been badly named natural causes and the final causes has to be determined
- HoP 1",140
3140,"Now if I isolate individuality and merely regard it as movement and the moments of the same, I show what are natural causes
- HoP 1",131
3141,"For example, where has this life taken its origin?
- HoP 1",58
3142,"Through the generation of this its father and mother
- HoP 1",60
3143,"What is the cause of these fruits?
- HoP 1",42
3144,"The tree whose juices so distil themselves that the fruit forthwith arises
- HoP 1",82
3145,"Answers of this kind give the causes, ie the individuality opposed to an individuality; but their principle is the genus
- HoP 1",128
3146,"Now nature cannot represent essence as such
- HoP 1",51
3147,"The end of generation is the sublation of the individuality of Being; but nature which in existence certainly brings about this sublation of individuality, does not set the universal in its place, but another individual
- HoP 1",227
3148,"Bones, muscles, &c, bring forth a movement; they are causes, but they themselves are so through other causes, and so on into infinitude
- HoP 1",143
3149,"The universal, however, takes them up into itself as moments which undoubtedly appear in movement as causes, though the fundamental ground of these parts actually is the whole
- HoP 1",183
3150,"It is not they which come first, but the result into which the juices of the plants, &c, pass, is the first, just as in origination it appears only as product, as seed, that which constitutes the beginning and the end, even though they be in different individuals
- HoP 1",271
3151,"Their real nature is the same
- HoP 1",37
3152,"But such a genus is itself a particular genus and is essentially related to another, eg the Idea of the plant to that of the animal; the universal moves on
- HoP 1",163
3153,"This looks like external teleology—that plants are eaten by animals, &c, in which their limitation as genus lies
- HoP 1",120
3154,"The genus of the plant has the absolute totality of its realization in the animal, the animal in the conscious existence, just as the earth has it in the plant
- HoP 1",167
3155,"This is the system of the whole in which each moment is transitory
- HoP 1",74
3156,"The double method of considering the matter thus is that each Idea is a circle within itself, the plant or the animal the Good of its kind; and, on the other hand, each is a moment in the universal Good
- HoP 1",210
3157,"If I consider the animal merely as externally adapted to an end, as created for something else, I consider it in a one-sided way; it is real existence, in and for itself universal
- HoP 1",187
3158,"But it is just as one-sided to say that the plant, for instance, is only in and for itself, only end to itself, only shut up within itself and going back into itself
- HoP 1",173
3159,"For each idea is a circle which is complete in itself, but whose completion is likewise a passing into another circle; it is a vortex whose middle point, that into which it returns, is found directly in the periphery of a higher circle which swallows it up
- HoP 1",264
3160,"Thus, for the first time, we reach the determination of an end in the world which is immanent within it
- HoP 1",111
3161,"These explanations are necessary here, since hereafter we see the speculative Idea coming more into the universal; it was formerly expressed as Being and the moments and movements were called existent
- HoP 1",208
3162,"This is the meaning which is present when we represent to ourselves that thought constitutes, orders, &c, the world
- HoP 1",123
3163,"It is not, so to speak, the activity of the individual consciousness, in which I stand here on one side and, opposite to me, an actuality, matter, which I form, dispose and order as I will; for the universal, Thought, must abide in Philosophy without this opposition
- HoP 1",274
3165,"So far, the ancients really got: it does not seem far
- HoP 1",61
3166,"Thought, indeed, reaches to the invisibility of the sensuous; not to the positive determinateness of thinking it as universal, but only to the predicateless absolute as to the merely negative; and that is as far as the common ideas of the present day have come
- HoP 1",268
3167,"With this discovery of thought we conclude the first Section and enter upon the second period
- HoP 1",101
3168,"The profit to be derived from the first period is not very great
- HoP 1",72
3169,"Some, indeed, think that there is still some special wisdom in it, but thought is still young, the determinations are thus still poor, abstract and arid
- HoP 1",160
3170,"Thought here has but few determinations—water, Being, number, &c—and these cannot endure; the universal must go forth on its own account as the self-determining activity, and this we find it doing in Anaxagoras alone
- HoP 1",224
3171,"We have still to consider the relationship of the universal as opposed to Being, or consciousness as such in its relation to what is
- HoP 1",140
3172,"By Anaxagoras’ determination of real existence, this relationship of consciousness is also determined
- HoP 1",109
3173,"In this regard nothing satisfactory can be found; for he recognized, on the one hand, thought as real existence, without, however, bringing this thought to bear on ordinary reality
- HoP 1",188
3174,"Thus, on the other hand, this is destitute of thought and independent, an infinite number of homœomeriæ, ie an infinite amount of a sensuous implicit existence, which now, however, is sensuous Being; for existent Being is an accumulation of homœomeriæ
- HoP 1",259
3175,"The relationship borne by consciousness to real existence may likewise be various
- HoP 1",89
3176,"Anaxagoras could thus either say that the truth is only in thought and in rational knowledge, or that it is sensuous perception; for in this we have the homœomeriæ which are themselves implicit
- HoP 1",201
3177,"Thus, in the first place, we find from him—as Sextus tells us, (adv
- HoP 1",75
3179,"A celebrated example of this is given by him according to Sextus (Pyrrh
- HoP 1",79
3180,"In the second place, according to Aristotle (Met

3181,"For because the two sides of the opposition are mingled, what is mingled is neither good nor not good, and thus not true” Aristotle also quotes another time from him (Met
- HoP 1",178
3182,"There is little more to be made of this
- HoP 1",47
3183,"But here we have the beginning of a more distinct development of the relationship of consciousness to Being, the development of the nature of knowledge as a knowledge of the true
- HoP 1",186
3184,"The mind has gone forth to express real existence as Thought; and thus real existence as existent, is in consciousness as such; it is implicit but likewise in consciousness
- HoP 1",180
3185,"This Being is such only in so far as consciousness recognizes it, and real existence is only the knowledge of it
- HoP 1",120
3186,"The mind has no longer to seek existence in something foreign, since it is in itself; for what formerly appeared foreign is Thought, ie consciousness has this real existence in itself
- HoP 1",191
3187,"But this consciousness in opposition is an individual consciousness; thereby in fact, implicit Being is sublated, for the implicit is what is not opposed, not singled out, but universal
- HoP 1",193
3188,"It is, indeed, known, but what is, only is in knowledge, or it is no other Being than that of the knowledge of consciousness
- HoP 1",132
3189,"We see this development of the universal in which real existence goes right over to the side of consciousness, in the so much decried worldly wisdom of the Sophists; we may view this as indicating that the negative nature of the universal is now developing
- HoP 1",264
3190,"IN this second division we have first to consider more particularly the Sophists, secondly Socrates, and thirdly the Socratics, while we distinguish from these Plato, and take him along with Aristotle in the third division
- HoP 1",230
3191,"The νοῦς, which is at first only grasped in a very subjective manner as end, that is to say as that which is end to men, ie the Good, in Plato and Aristotle became understood in what is on the whole an objective way, as genus or Idea
- HoP 1",241
3194,"But what is this absolute, universal content which abstract thought as self-determining activity gives itself?
- HoP 1",118
3195,"That is the real question here
- HoP 1",38
3196,"Consciousness now confronts the untrammeled thought of those ancient philosophers, whose general ideas we have considered
- HoP 1",129
3199,"This content, taken abstractly, may itself be again a double one
- HoP 1",72
3200,"Either the “I” is in respect of determination the real when it makes itself and its interests the content, or the content becomes determined as the altogether universal
- HoP 1",176
3201,"According to this, we have two questions to deal with, which are—how the determination of what is in and for itself is to be comprehended, and how this is likewise in immediate relation to the “I” as thinking
- HoP 1",216
3202,"It comes to pass in Philosophy that although the “I” is the positing, yet the posited content of that which is thought is the object existent in and for itself
- HoP 1",167
3203,"If one were to remain at saying that the “I” is that which posits, this would be the false idealism of modern times: in earlier times men did not remain at saying that what is thought is bad because I posit it
- HoP 1",217
3204,"To the Sophists the content is mine, and subjective: Socrates grasped the content which is in and for itself, and the followers of Socrates have, in direct connection with him, merely further defined this content
- HoP 1",220
3205,"The Notion, which reason has found in Anaxagoras to be real existence, is the simple negative into which all determination, all that is existent and individual sinks
- HoP 1",173
3206,"Before the Notion nothing can exist, for it is simply the predicateless absolute to which everything is clearly a moment only; for it there is thus nothing so to speak permanently fixed and sealed
- HoP 1",204
3207,"The Notion is just the constant change of Heraclitus, the movement, the causticity, which nothing can resist
- HoP 1",116
3208,"Thus the Notion which finds itself, finds itself as the absolute power before which everything vanishes; and thereby all things, all existence, everything held to be secure, is now made fleeting
- HoP 1",202
3209,"This security—whether it be a security of natural Being or the security of definite conceptions, principles, customs and laws—becomes vacillation and loses its stability
- HoP 1",177
3210,"As universal, such principles, &c, certainly themselves pertain to the Notion, yet their universality is only their form, for the content which they have, as determinate, falls into movement
- HoP 1",198
3211,"We see this movement arising in the so-called Sophists whom we here encounter for the first time
- HoP 1",104
3212,"They gave themselves the name σοφισταί, as teachers of wisdom, ie as those who could make wise (σοφίζειν)
- HoP 1",113
3214,"Our learned professors are in so far much less responsible than the Sophists; however, Philosophy has nothing to do with this lack of responsibility
- HoP 1",156
3215,"But as regards the relation of the Sophists to what is ordinarily believed, they are, by the healthy human understanding, as much decried as by morality
- HoP 1",160
3216,"By the former this is on account of their theoretic teaching, since it is senseless to say that nothing is; and in respect of practice because they subvert all principles and laws
- HoP 1",187
3219,"Mind itself is, however, the unity of these in many ways limited truths, which in it are all recognized as being present as sublated only, as merely relative truths, ie with their restrictions, in their limitation, and not as existent in themselves
- HoP 1",256
3222,"For example, a statesman of experience and culture is one who knows how to steer a middle course, and has practical understanding, ie deals with the whole extent of the case before him and not with one side of it, which expresses itself in one maxim only
- HoP 1",262
3223,"On the other hand, he, whoever he is, who acts on one maxim, is a pedant and spoils things for himself and others
- HoP 1",121
3224,"Most commonly it is thus
- HoP 1",32
3225,"For example, we hear it said, “it is certain that the things that I see are; I believe in their reality” Anyone can say this quite easily
- HoP 1",145
3226,"But in fact it is not true that he believes in their reality; really he assumes the contrary
- HoP 1",100
3227,"For he eats and drinks them, ie he is convinced that these things are not in themselves, and their being has no security, no subsistence
- HoP 1",144
3228,"Thus common understanding is in its actions better than it thinks, for in action it is Mind as a whole
- HoP 1",110
3229,"But it is not here known to itself as Mind, for what comes within its consciousness are definite laws, rules, general propositions, such as by its understanding are esteemed to be the absolute truth, whose limitation it, however, sets aside in action
- HoP 1",258
3231,"This is the ground of the universal denunciation of the Sophists; a denunciation of healthy human understanding which does not know how else to help itself
- HoP 1",163
3233,"We have to put this evil significance on one side and to forget it
- HoP 1",74
3234,"On the other hand, we now wish to consider further from the positive and properly speaking scientific side, what was the position of the Sophists in Greece
- HoP 1",163
3235,"It was the Sophists who now applied the simple Notion as thought (which with Zeno in the Eleatic school had commenced to turn towards its pure counterpart, motion) to worldly objects generally, and with it penetrated all human relations
- HoP 1",244
3236,"For it is conscious of itself as the absolute and single reality, and, jealous of all else, exercises its power and rule in this reality as regards all else, since this desires to be considered as the determinate which is not Thought
- HoP 1",241
3238,"Now that this Notion has appeared, it has become a more universal Philosophy, and not so much simple Philosophy as the universal culture of which every man who did not belong to those devoid of thought, partook, and necessarily partook
- HoP 1",243
3239,"For we call culture just the Notion as applied in actuality, in so far as it makes its appearance not purely in its abstraction, but in unity with the manifold content of all ordinary conceptions
- HoP 1",203
3240,"But in culture, the Notion is the predominant as also the actuating, because in both the determinate is recognized in its limits, in its transition into something else
- HoP 1",175
3241,"This culture became the general aim of education, and there were hence a number of teachers of Sophistry
- HoP 1",112
3242,"Indeed, the Sophists are the teachers of Greece through whom culture first came into existence in Greece, and thus they took the place of poets and of rhapsodists, who before this were the ordinary instructors
- HoP 1",217
3243,"For religion was no instructress, since no teaching was in it imparted; and though priests certainly offered sacrifices, prophesied and interpreted the sayings of the oracle, instruction is something quite different from this
- HoP 1",233
3244,"But the Sophists educated men in wisdom, in the sciences, music, mathematics, &c, and this was their foremost aim
- HoP 1",121
3246,"For the end of the State is the universal, under which the particular is comprehended
- HoP 1",93
3247,"Because the Sophists kept in view and enlarged upon this culture, they prosecuted teaching as a special calling, business, or profession, as an office taking the place of schools; they travelled round the towns of Greece, the youth of which was by them instructed
- HoP 1",271
3248,"Now culture is certainly an indefinite expression
- HoP 1",57
3249,"It has, however, this meaning, that what free thought is to attain must come out of itself and be personal conviction; it is then no longer believed but investigated—in short, it is the so-called enlightenment of modern times
- HoP 1",233
3250,"Thought seeks general principles by which it criticizes everything which is by us esteemed, and nothing has value to us which is not in conformity with these principles
- HoP 1",176
3252,"These aspects, which are properly not independent, but only moments of a whole, when detached from it, relate themselves to themselves, and in this way assume the form of universality
- HoP 1",191
3253,"Any one of them can thus be elevated to a reason, ie to a universal determination, which is again applied to particular aspects
- HoP 1",135
3255,"A judge knows the various laws, ie the various legal points of view under which a thing is to be considered; these are already for him universal aspects through which he has a universal consciousness, and considers the matter in a universal way
- HoP 1",252
3256,"A man of culture thus knows how to say something of everything, to find points of view in all
- HoP 1",101
3257,"Greece has to thank the Sophists for this culture, because they taught men to exercise thought as to what should have authority for them, and thus their culture was culture in philosophy as much as in eloquence
- HoP 1",218
3258,"In order to reach this double end, the Sophists were one in their desire to be wise
- HoP 1",91
3259,"To know what constitutes power amongst men and in the State, and what I have to recognize as such, is counted as wisdom; and because I know the power, I also know how to direct others in conformity with my end
- HoP 1",217
3260,"Hence the admiration that Pericles and other statesmen excited, just because they knew their own standpoint, and had the power of putting others in their proper place
- HoP 1",174
3261,"That man is powerful who can deduce the actions of men from the absolute ends which move them
- HoP 1",101
3262,"The object of the Sophists has thus been to teach what is the mainspring of the world, and since Philosophy alone knows that this is the universal thought which resolves all that is particular, the Sophists were also speculative philosophers
- HoP 1",249
3263,"Learned in the proper sense they hence were not, because there were as yet no positive sciences without Philosophy, such as in their aridity did not concern all mankind and man’s essential aspects
- HoP 1",204
3264,"They further had the most ordinary practical end, to give a consciousness of that which is involved in the moral world and which satisfies man
- HoP 1",150
3265,"Religion taught that the gods are the powers which rule over men
- HoP 1",72
3266,"Immediate morality recognized the rule of laws; man was to find satisfaction in conforming to laws, and was to assume that others also find satisfaction because they follow these laws
- HoP 1",191
3268,"Thus the impulses and desires that man has, become his power; and only inasmuch as he affords them satisfaction does he become satisfied
- HoP 1",144
3269,"Now the Sophists taught how these powers could be moved in empirical man, for the good as ordinarily recognized, no longer determined them
- HoP 1",146
3270,"Rhetoric, however, teaches how circumstances may be made subject to such forces; it even makes use of the wrath and passions of the hearer in order to bring about a conclusion
- HoP 1",183
3274,"Aristotle’s Topica comes to mind in the connection, inasmuch as it gives the categories or thought-determinations (τόπους), according to which we have to regard things in order to learn to speak; but the Sophists were the first to apply themselves to a knowledge of these
- HoP 1",279
3275,"This is the position taken up by the Sophists
- HoP 1",53
3276,"But we find a perfectly definite picture of their further progress and procedure in Plato’s Protagoras
- HoP 1",110
3277,"Plato here makes Protagoras express himself more precisely respecting the art of the Sophists
- HoP 1",101
3278,"That is to say, Plato in this dialogue represents that Socrates accompanies a young man named Hippocrates, who desires to place himself under Protagoras, then newly arrived in Athens, for instruction in the science of the Sophists
- HoP 1",238
3279,"On the way, Socrates now asks Hippocrates what is this wisdom of the Sophists which he wishes to learn
- HoP 1",110
3280,"Hippocrates at first replies Rhetoric, for the Sophist is one who knows how to make men clever (δεινόν) in speech
- HoP 1",121
3281,"In fact, what is most striking in a man or people of culture is the art of speaking well, or of turning subjects round and considering them in many aspects
- HoP 1",163
3282,"The uncultivated man finds it unpleasant to associate with people who know how to grasp and express every point of view with ease
- HoP 1",137
3283,"The French are good speakers in this sense, and the Germans call their talking prattle; but it is not mere talk that brings about this result, for culture is also wanted
- HoP 1",177
3284,"Men thus learn French, not only to be able to speak French well, but to acquire French culture
- HoP 1",102
3287,"Protagoras praises his discretion, and replies that they act wisely to make use of this precaution
- HoP 1",106
3288,"For because the Sophists wandered about the towns, and thus youths, deserting fathers and friends, followed them in view of improving themselves through their intercourse with them, they drew upon themselves much envy and ill-will—for everything new is hated
- HoP 1",266
3289,"On this point Protagoras speaks at length: “I assert that the art of the Sophists is old; but that those of the ancients who practised it in fear of giving offence” (for the uncultured world is antagonistic to the cultured) “veiled and concealed it
- HoP 1",256
3290,"One section, like Homer and Hesiod, taught it in their poetry; others, like Orpheus and Musæus, through mysteries and oracles
- HoP 1",133
3291,"He adds: “all those who feared envy arising against the sciences, required such veils and screens
- HoP 1",105
3292,"But I think that they do not attain their end, for men of penetration in the State see the end appearing through, while the people notice nothing, and only quote the others

3293,"If people behave so, they make themselves more hated, and appear to be impostors

3294,"Hippocrates will not have the same experience that he would have with other teachers (σοφιστῶν)
- HoP 1",103
3295,"These latter are at variance with (λωβῶνται) their pupils, for they take them against their wills straight back to the arts and sciences which they just wished to escape, inasmuch as they teach them arithmetic, geometry and music
- HoP 1",237
3296,"But he who comes to me will be instructed in nothing else than that in which he comes to be instructed” Thus the youths came freely, with the wish to be made men of culture through his instruction, and in the hope that he, as teacher, knew the way to succeed in so doing
- HoP 1",278
3298,"Now Socrates expresses dissent and surprise at Protagoras’ assertion as to imparting instruction in political aptitude
- HoP 1",126
3299,"And Socrates now brings forward the following argument, after the manner of the Sophists appealing to experience
- HoP 1",120
3300,"Pericles, the father of these youths, gave them instruction in all that instructors could teach; but not in the science for which he is celebrated; here he left them free to wander in the chance of their lighting upon wisdom
- HoP 1",232
3302,"The company left the matter to him and he began with the following myth of everlasting interest: “The gods commanded Prometheus and Epimetheus to adorn the world and confer on it its qualities and powers
- HoP 1",211
3303,"Epimetheus imparted strength, power of flight, arms, clothing, herbs and fruits, but in some incomprehensible way he gave all to the beasts, so that nothing remained to men
- HoP 1",180
3304,"Prometheus saw them unclothed, unarmed, helpless, when the moment came in which the form of man had to go forth into the light
- HoP 1",134
3305,"Then he stole fire from heaven, the arts of Vulcan and Minerva, to equip man for his needs
- HoP 1",98
3306,"But political wisdom was wanting, and, living without any common bond, they were in a constant state of strife and misery
- HoP 1",129
3307,"Then Zeus gave the command to Hermes to grant reverence” (natural obedience, honour, docility, respect of children for parents, and of men for higher and better natures), “and justice
- HoP 1",191
3308,"Hermes asks, ‘How shall I impart them?
- HoP 1",46
3309,"To individuals, as particular arts are distributed, just as some have a knowledge of medicine sufficient for assisting others?’ But Zeus answers that it must be to all, for no body of men (πόλις) can exist if only a few partake of those qualities
- HoP 1",254
3310,"And it shall be the law that whoever cannot acknowledge authority and justice must be exterminated as a plague to the State
- HoP 1",131
3311,"Hence the Athenians when they wish to build, call builders into counsel, and when they contemplate any other business, those who have experience in it, but when they wish to come to a decision or make a regulation in State affairs, they admit all
- HoP 1",254
3312,"For all must partake of this virtue or no State could exist
- HoP 1",67
3313,"Thus if anyone is inexperienced in the art of flute-playing and yet professes to be a master in it, he is justly thought to be mad
- HoP 1",138
3314,"But in justice it is otherwise; if anyone is not just and confesses it, he is thought to be mad
- HoP 1",103
3316,"But defects and faults which can be removed through diligence, exercise and teaching are considered to be blameworthy and punishable
- HoP 1",140
3317,"Impiety and injustice are of this description and, generally speaking, all that opposes public virtue
- HoP 1",109
3318,"Men guilty of these sins are thus reproached; they are punished in the idea that they had the power to remove the wrong and still more to acquire political virtue through diligence and teaching
- HoP 1",201
3319,"Thus men do not punish on account of what is past—excepting as we strike a vicious beast on the head—but on account of what is to come, so that neither the one who committed the crime nor any other misled by his example, should do the same again
- HoP 1",253
3320,"Thus it is in this implied that virtue can be acquired through education and exercise”90 This is a good argument for the teachability of virtue
- HoP 1",151
3322,"Political virtue is so constituted that it is the common province of all; this one essential for all men is justice, temperance, and holiness—in one word, whatever comprises manly virtue
- HoP 1",194
3323,"In it no particular education from men of eminence is thus required
- HoP 1",75
3324,"The children are from their earliest infancy exhorted and admonished to do what is good, and are accustomed to that which is right
- HoP 1",138
3325,"Instruction in music and gymnastics contributes to temper the indulgence of self-will and pleasure, and to accustom men to conform to a law or rule; and the reading of the poets who enforce this does the same
- HoP 1",216
3327,"But it might very well be the case that the son of an artist should be a bad player, for the distinction depends on particular talents, and a particularly good natural capacity
- HoP 1",184
3328,"From very skilful players very unskilful might descend, and conversely, but all would have a certain knowledge of the flute, and all would certainly be infinitely better than those who were quite ignorant of the art
- HoP 1",223
3329,"Similarly all, even the worst citizens of a rational State are better and juster than citizens of a State where there is no culture nor justice nor law, in a word, where there is no necessity to bring them up to be just
- HoP 1",227
3330,"For this superiority they have to thank the education given in their State”91 All these are quite good examples and striking arguments which are not at all worse than Cicero’s reasoning—a natura insitum
- HoP 1",210
3331,"The arguments of Socrates and the development of these arguments are, on the contrary, examples based upon experience, and are often not better than what is here placed in the mouth of a Sophist
- HoP 1",202
3332,"What now confronts us is the question of how far this may be inadequate, and particularly how far Socrates and Plato came into collision with the Sophists and constituted the antagonism to them
- HoP 1",201
3333,"For the claim made by the Sophists in Greece was that they had given a higher culture to their people; for this, indeed, great credit was ascribed to them in Greece, but they were met by the reproach that was encountered by all culture
- HoP 1",243
3335,"This, the necessary course of free, thinking reflection, which with us has also been adopted by culture, must, however, necessarily lead beyond implicit trust and unrestricted faith in the current morality and religion
- HoP 1",226
3339,"Thus here there is a groundwork of a fixed spiritual principle which thus satisfies the needs of the subjective mind; and from this absolute principle all further relationships, duties, laws, &c, are established
- HoP 1",219
3340,"Consequently culture cannot receive the variety of direction—and hence the aimlessness—of the Greeks and of those who extended culture over Greece, the Sophists
- HoP 1",168
3341,"As regards the religion of the imagination, as regards the undeveloped principle of the Greek State, culture was able to divide itself into many points of view, or it was easy to it to represent particular subordinate points of view as highest principles
- HoP 1",262
3343,"Hence came the evil reputation obtained by the Sophists through the antagonism of Plato, and this is certainly their defect
- HoP 1",131
3344,"As to their outward lives, we know that the Sophists accumulated great riches;92 they became very proud, and some of them lived very luxuriously
- HoP 1",152
3346,"To Plato and Socrates, on the other hand, the main point is that the nature of the conditions should be considered, and that the Notion of the thing in and for itself should become evolved
- HoP 1",196
3347,"Socrates and Plato wished to bring forward this Notion as opposed to the consideration of things from points of view and reasonings which are always merely particular and individual, and thus opposed to the Notion itself
- HoP 1",228
3350,"And just as utterances of the Sophists are adduced against which nothing can be said (as they are by Plato), men of our day are urged to all that is good for the very reasons that are reasons to the Sophists
- HoP 1",215
3352,"If, on the other hand, firmly rooted principles lie at the foundation—as in the Christian Religion, although men now remember this no longer—it is said, “the grace of God in respect of holiness, &c, thus directs the life of men;” and these external grounds fall away
- HoP 1",274
3353,"Sophistry thus does not lie so far from us as we think
- HoP 1",62
3354,"When educated men discuss matters now-a-days, it may seem all very good, but it is in no way different from what Socrates and Plato called sophistry—although they themselves have adopted this standpoint as truly as did the Sophists
- HoP 1",239
3355,"Educated men fall into it when they judge of concrete cases in which a particular point of view determines the result, and we must in ordinary life do the same if we wish to make up our minds in action
- HoP 1",209
3356,"If duties and virtues are advocated as in sermons (this is so in most sermons), we must hear such reasons given
- HoP 1",119
3357,"Other speakers, such as those in parliament, likewise make use of arguments and counterarguments similar to these, through which they try to persuade and convince
- HoP 1",170
3359,"Men likewise make use of good arguments, after the manner of the Sophists, against Philosophy
- HoP 1",101
3360,"There are, they say, various philosophies, various opinions, and this is contrary to the one Truth; the weakness of human reason allows of no knowledge
- HoP 1",159
3361,"What is Philosophy to the feelings, mind, and heart?
- HoP 1",60
3362,"Abstract thinking about such matters produces abstruse results which are of no use in the practical life of man
- HoP 1",119
3363,"We shall see this characteristic of the Sophists more clearly still in Socrates and Plato
- HoP 1",97
3364,"Thus what has been considered the sin of the Sophists is that they taught men to deduce any conclusion required by others or by themselves; but that is not due to any special quality in the Sophists, but to reflective reasoning
- HoP 1",235
3365,"In the worst action there exists a point of view which is essentially real; if this is brought to the front, men excuse and vindicate the action
- HoP 1",152
3366,"In the crime of desertion in time of war, there is, for example, the duty of self-preservation
- HoP 1",102
3367,"Similarly in more modern times the greatest crimes, assassination, treachery, &c, have been justified, because in the purpose there lay a determination which was actually essential, such as that men must resist the evil and promote the good
- HoP 1",248
3368,"The educated man knows how to regard everything from the point of view of the good, to maintain in everything a real point of view
- HoP 1",138
3369,"A man does not require to make great progress in his education to have good reasons ready for the worst action; all that has happened in the world since the time of Adam has been justified by some good reason
- HoP 1",216
3370,"It appears that the Sophists were conscious of this reasoning, and knew, as educated men, that everything could be proved
- HoP 1",129
3373,"The Sophists thus knew that on this basis nothing was secure, because the power of thought treated everything dialectically
- HoP 1",131
3375,"Once it was highest and ultimate, then it was deposed
- HoP 1",61
3377,"We saw in the same way, how bravery, which lies in the hazarding of one’s life, is made dubious by the duty of preserving life, if put forward unconditionally
- HoP 1",166
3378,"With this comes the question which the nature of thought brings along with it
- HoP 1",85
3379,"If the field of argument, that which consciousness holds to be firmly established, is shaken by reflection, what is man now to take as his ultimate basis?
- HoP 1",162
3380,"For something fixed there must be
- HoP 1",41
3381,"This is either the good, the universal, or the individuality, the arbitrary will of the subject; and both may be united, as is shown later on in Socrates
- HoP 1",161
3383,"Here the danger lies
- HoP 1",28
3384,"This takes place also in the present day where the right and the true in our actions is made to depend on good intention and on my own conviction
- HoP 1",153
3385,"The real end of the State, the best administration and constitution, is likewise to demagogues very vague
- HoP 1",113
3386,"On account of their formal culture, the Sophists have a place in Philosophy; on account of their reflection they have not
- HoP 1",129
3387,"They are associated with Philosophy in that they do not remain at concrete reasoning, but go on, at least in part, to ultimate determinations
- HoP 1",149
3388,"A chief part of their culture was the generalization of the Eleatic mode of thought and its extension to the whole content of knowledge and of action; the positive thus comes in as, and has become, utility
- HoP 1",213
3389,"To go into particulars respecting the Sophists would lead us too far; individual Sophists have their place in the general history of culture
- HoP 1",148
3391,"I will deal only with Protagoras and Gorgias, not from the point of view of culture, but in respect of proving further how the general knowledge which they extended to everything, has, with one of them, the universal form which makes it pure science
- HoP 1",257
3392,"Plato is the chief source of our acquaintanceship with the Sophists, for he occupied himself largely with them; then we have Aristotle’s own little treatise on Gorgias; and Sextus Empiricus, who preserved for us much of the philosophy of Protagoras
- HoP 1",256
3393,"Protagoras, born at Abdera,97 was somewhat older than Socrates; little more is known of him, nor, indeed, could there be much known
- HoP 1",139
3394,"For he led a uniform life, since he spent it in the study of the sciences; he appeared in Greece proper as the first public teacher
- HoP 1",139
3395,"He read his writings98 like the rhapsodists and poets, the former of whom sang the verses of others, and the latter their own
- HoP 1",133
3397,"The Sophists now gave, in place of a knowledge of the poets, an acquaintanceship with thought
- HoP 1",101
3398,"Protagoras also came to Athens and there lived for long, principally with the great Pericles, who also entered into this culture
- HoP 1",136
3400,"In his intercourse with such men, Pericles developed his genius for eloquence; for whatever kind of mental occupation may be in question, a cultivated mind can alone excel in it; and true culture is only possible through pure science
- HoP 1",241
3401,"Pericles was a powerful orator, and we see from Thucydides how deep a knowledge he had of the State and of his people
- HoP 1",125
3402,"Protagoras had the same fate as Anaxagoras, in being afterwards banished from Athens
- HoP 1",92
3408,"The same statement is brought forward in Socrates and Plato, but with the further modification that here man, in that he is thinking and gives himself a universal content, is the measure
- HoP 1",194
3409,"Thus here the great proposition is enunciated on which, from this time forward, everything turns, since the further progress of Philosophy only explains it further: it signifies that reason is the end of all things
- HoP 1",222
3411,"Since man, as subject, is the measure of everything, the existent is not alone, but is for my knowledge
- HoP 1",111
3412,"Consciousness is really the producer of the content in what is objective, and subjective thinking is thus really active
- HoP 1",127
3413,"And this view extends even to the most modern philosophy, as when, for instance, Kant says that we only know phenomena, ie that what seems to us to be objective reality, is only to be considered in its relation to consciousness, and does not exist without this relation
- HoP 1",277
3415,"God, the Platonic Good, is certainly at first a product of thought, but in the second place He is just as really in and for Himself
- HoP 1",139
3416,"Since I, as existent, fixed and eternal, only recognize what is in its content universal, this, posited as it is by me, is likewise the implicitly objective, not posited by me
- HoP 1",183
3417,"Protagoras himself shows us much more of what is implied in his theory, for he says, “Truth is a manifestation for consciousness
- HoP 1",136
3418,"Nothing is in and for itself one, but everything has a relative truth only,” ie it is what it is but for another, which is man
- HoP 1",134
3419,"This relativity is by Protagoras expressed in a way which seems to us in some measure trivial, and belongs to the first beginnings of reflective thought
- HoP 1",160
3420,"The insignificant examples which he adduces (like Plato and Socrates when they follow out in them the point of view of reflection), by way of explanation, show that in Protagoras’ understanding what is determined is not grasped as the universal and identical with self
- HoP 1",276
3421,"Hence the exemplifications are taken mostly from sensuous manifestation
- HoP 1",79
3422,"Or again, “if we have here six dice, and place by them four others, we should say of the former that there are more of them
- HoP 1",131
3424,"Plato, on the contrary, considered one and many, not like the Sophists in their distinction, but as being one and the same
- HoP 1",130
3425,"Plato says further on this point, that the white, warm, &c, or everything that we say of things, does not exist for itself, but that the eye, sensation, is necessary to make it for us
- HoP 1",191
3427,"This objective relativity is expressed better in the following way
- HoP 1",74
3428,"If the white were in itself, it would be that which brought forth the sensation of it; it would be the action or the cause, and we, on the contrary, the passive and receptive
- HoP 1",182
3429,"But the object which thus requires to be active, is not active until it enters into (ξυνέλθῃ) relation with the passive; similarly the passive is only in relation to the active
- HoP 1",184
3430,"Thus what is said in defining anything never concerns the thing as in itself, but clearly only as being related to something else
- HoP 1",137
3431,"Nothing is thus constituted in and for itself as it appears, but the truth is just this phenomenon to which our activity contributes
- HoP 1",140
3433,"The phenomenon is, according to him, nothing but the fact of there being outside an impulse, an unknown x, which first receives these determinations through our feeling
- HoP 1",176
3434,"Even if there were an objective ground for our calling one thing cold and another warm, we could indeed say that they must have diversity in themselves, but warmth and cold first become what they are in our feeling
- HoP 1",222
3436,"We see that Protagoras possesses great powers of reflective thought, and indeed reflection on consciousness came to consciousness with Protagoras
- HoP 1",153
3437,"But this is the form of manifestation which was again taken by the later sceptics
- HoP 1",89
3438,"The phenomenal is not sensuous Being, for because I posit this as phenomenal, I assert its nullity
- HoP 1",106
3439,"But the statements “What is, is only for consciousness,” or “The truth of all things is the manifestation of them in and for consciousness,” seem quite to contradict themselves
- HoP 1",184
3440,"For it appears as though a contradiction were asserted—first that nothing is in itself as it appears, and then that it is true as it appears
- HoP 1",148
3442,"The world is consequently not only phenomenal in that it is for consciousness, and thus that its Being is only one relative to consciousness, for it is likewise in itself phenomenal
- HoP 1",189
3444,"This scepticism reached a much deeper point in Gorgias of Leontium in Sicily, a man of great culture, and also distinguished as a statesman
- HoP 1",147
3445,"During the Peloponnesian war he was, in Ol
- HoP 1",50
3446,"Thus he obtained great wealth, along with much admiration, and this lasted till his death at over a hundred years of age
- HoP 1",128
3448,"Sextus Empiricus also gives us in full the dialectic of Gorgias
- HoP 1",71
3449,"He was strong in the dialectic requisite for eloquence, but his preeminence lies in his pure dialectic respecting the quite universal categories of Being and non-being, which indeed is not like that of the Sophists
- HoP 1",222
3451,"Healthy human understanding possesses the modes of thought, maxims, and judgments of its time, the thought-determinations of which dominate it without its being conscious thereof
- HoP 1",186
3452,"In this way Gorgias undoubtedly went further than healthy understanding
- HoP 1",79
3453,"Before Copernicus it would have been contrary to all healthy human understanding if anyone had said that the earth went round the sun, or before the discovery of America, if it were said that there was a continent there
- HoP 1",227
3454,"In India or in China a republic would even now be contrary to all healthy understanding
- HoP 1",95
3455,"The dialectic of Gorgias moves more purely in Notion than that found in Protagoras
- HoP 1",90
3456,"Since Protagoras asserted the relativity, or the non-implicit nature of all that is, this only exists in relation to another which really is essential to it; and this last, indeed, is consciousness
- HoP 1",205
3458,"Gorgias’ treatise “On Nature,” in which he composes his dialectic, falls, according to Sextus Empiricus (adv

3461,"That is, in so far as it is thought of as non-existent, it is not; but in so far as it is the non-existent, it must exist
- HoP 1",129
3462,"But it cannot at the same time be and not be
- HoP 1",52
3463,"Again, if the non-existent is, the existent is not, for the two are opposed

3464,"Thus, if Being pertained to non-being, non-being would belong to Being
- HoP 1",78
3465,"But if Being does not exist, no more does non-being”109 This is with Gorgias a characteristic mode of reasoning110  β
- HoP 1",125
3466,"For Gorgias says: “What is, either is in itself (ἀΐδιον) being without beginning, or it has originated,” and he now shows that it could neither be the one nor the other, for each leads to contradiction
- HoP 1",209
3467,"Just as little is it contained in itself, for then that in which it is, and that which is therein, would be the same
- HoP 1",124
3468,"What it is in, is the place; that which is in this, is the body; but that both should be the same is absurd
- HoP 1",115
3470,"On the other hand, Gorgias is quite right, for the bad, sensuous infinite is nowhere present, and thus does not exist, but is a Beyond of Being; only we may take what Gorgias takes as a diversity of place, as being diversity generally
- HoP 1",242
3472,"From the existent it did not arise, for then it would be already; just as little from the non-existent, because this cannot beget anything”112 The sceptics followed this up further
- HoP 1",188
3473,"The object to be contemplated hence ever becomes posited under determinations with ‘either’ ‘or,’ which then contradict one another
- HoP 1",139
3475,"In a similar way Gorgias shows “of what exists, that it must either be one or many; but neither is possible

3499,"If we shortly recall the periods already passed over, we find that the ancient Ionic philosophers certainly thought, but without reflecting on the thought or defining its product as thought
- HoP 1",197
3500,"The Atomists made objective existence into thoughts, but these were to them only abstractions, pure entities
- HoP 1",116
3501,"Anaxagoras, on the other hand, raised thought as such, into a principle which thereby presented itself as the all-powerful Notion, as the negative power over all that is definite and existent
- HoP 1",199
3502,"Protagoras finally expresses thought as real existence, but it is in this its movement, which is the all-resolving consciousness, the unrest of the Notion
- HoP 1",162
3503,"This unrest is in itself at the same time something restful or secure
- HoP 1",77
3507,"Socrates herein adopted firstly the doctrine of Anaxagoras that thought, the understanding, is the ruling and self-determining universal, though this principle did not, as with the Sophists, attain the form of formal culture or of abstract philosophizing
- HoP 1",262
3508,"Thus, if with Socrates, as with Protagoras, the self-conscious thought that abrogates all that is determined, was real existence, with Socrates this was the case in such a way that he at the same time grasped in thought rest and security
- HoP 1",245
3509,"This substance existing in and for itself, the self-retaining, has become determined as end, and further as the true and the good
- HoP 1",137
3510,"To this determination of the universal, we have, in the second place, to add that this good, which has by me to be esteemed as substantial end, must be known by me; with this the infinite subjectivity, the freedom of self-consciousness in Socrates breaks out
- HoP 1",266
3512,"Thus Socrates’ principle is that man has to find from himself both the end of his actions and the end of the world, and must attain to truth through himself
- HoP 1",164
3513,"True thought thinks in such a way that its import is as truly objective as subjective
- HoP 1",93
3514,"But objectivity has been the significance of substantial universality, and not of external objectivity; thus truth is now posited as a product mediated through thought, while untrained morality, as Sophocles makes Antigone say (vers
- HoP 1",240
3515,"The animal has no religion, because it only feels; but what is spiritual rests on the mediation of thought, and pertains to man
- HoP 1",135
3517,"Quite the contrary
- HoP 1",26
3518,"Reflection, and the reference of any judgment to consciousness, is held by Socrates in common with the Sophists
- HoP 1",119
3520,"Hence because, on the one hand, to Socrates and Plato the moment of subjective freedom is the directing of consciousness into itself, on the other, this return is also determined as a coming out from particular subjectivity
- HoP 1",231
3521,"It is hereby implied that contingency of events is abolished, and man has this outside within him, as the spiritual universal
- HoP 1",133
3522,"This is the true, the unity of subjective and objective in modern terminology, while the Kantian ideal is only phenomenal and not objective in itself
- HoP 1",157
3524,"Of Socrates it is hence said, in the older histories of Philosophy, that his main distinction was having added ethics as a new conception to Philosophy, which formerly only took nature into consideration
- HoP 1",211
3525,"Diogenes Laertius, in like manner says (III, 56), that the Ionics founded natural philosophy, Socrates ethics, and Plato added to them dialectic
- HoP 1",152
3527,"Objective morality is, on the contrary, natural, since it signifies the knowledge and doing of what is in and for itself good
- HoP 1",133
3528,"The Athenians before Socrates were objectively, and not subjectively, moral, for they acted rationally in their relations without knowing that they were particularly excellent
- HoP 1",183
3529,"Reflective morality adds to natural morality the reflection that this is the good and not that; the Kantian philosophy, which is reflectively moral, again showed the difference
- HoP 1",184
3530,"Because Socrates in this way gave rise to moral philosophy, all succeeding babblers about morality and popular philosophy constituted him their patron and object of adoration, and made him into a cloak which should cover all false philosophy
- HoP 1",249
3531,"As he treated it, it was undoubtedly popular; and what contributed to make it such was that his death gave him the never-failing interest derived from innocent suffering
- HoP 1",177
3533,"But this last is exactly what Socrates, as these men themselves indicate, first ventured to do
- HoP 1",102
3534,"And it was not incumbent on him to reflect upon all the speculations of past Philosophy, in order to be able to come down in practical philosophy to inward thought
- HoP 1",171
3535,"This gives a general idea of his principle
- HoP 1",50
3536,"We must examine more closely this noteworthy phenomenon, and begin with the history of Socrates’ life
- HoP 1",109
3537,"This is, however, closely intertwined with his interest in Philosophy, and the events of his life are bound up with his principles
- HoP 1",138
3538,"We have first of all to consider the beginning of his life only
- HoP 1",71
3539,"His father brought him up to sculpture, and it is said that Socrates acquired skill in the art, and long after, statues of draped Graces, found in the Acropolis, were ascribed to him
- HoP 1",190
3540,"But his art did not satisfy him; a great desire for Philosophy, and love of scientific research, got possession of him
- HoP 1",126
3541,"He pursued his art merely to get money for a necessary subsistence, and to be able to apply himself to the study of the sciences; and it is told of Crito, an Athenian, that he defrayed the cost of Socrates’ instruction by masters in all the arts
- HoP 1",253
3542,"During the exercise of his art, and specially after he gave it up altogether, he read the works of ancient philosophers in so far as he could get possession of them
- HoP 1",172
3543,"At the same time he attended Anaxagoras’ instructions, and, after his expulsion from Athens, at which time Socrates was thirty-seven years old, those of Archelaus, who was regarded as Anaxagoras’ successor, besides those of Sophists celebrated in other sciences
- HoP 1",269
3544,"Amongst these he heard Prodicus, a celebrated teacher of oratory, whom, according to Xenophon (Memorab
- HoP 1",110
3545,"Hence he made three campaigns in the Peloponnesian war, which occurred during his life
- HoP 1",94
3546,"The Peloponnesian war led to the dissolution of Greek life, inasmuch as it was preparatory to it; and what took place politically was by Socrates carried out in thinking consciousness
- HoP 1",191
3547,"In these campaigns he not only acquired the fame of a brave warrior, but, what was best of all, the merit of having saved the lives of other citizens
- HoP 1",157
3548,"In the first, he was present at the tedious siege of Potidæa in Thrace
- HoP 1",78
3549,"Here Alcibiades had already attached himself to him, and, according to Plato, he recited in the Banquet (p 219-222, Steph
- HoP 1",129
3550,"In an engagement in this campaign he saw Alcibiades wounded in the midst of the enemy, lifted him up, forced his way through, and saved both him and his arms
- HoP 1",165
3551,"The generals rewarded him with a wreath, which was the prize of the bravest; Socrates did not, however, take it, maintaining that it was given to Alcibiades
- HoP 1",164
3552,"In this campaign it is said that once, sunk in deep meditation, he stood immovable on one spot the whole day and night, until the morning sun awoke him from his trance—a condition in which he is said often to have been
- HoP 1",226
3553,"This was a cataleptic state, which may bear some relation to magnetic somnambulism, in which Socrates became quite dead to sensuous consciousness
- HoP 1",153
3554,"From this physical setting free of the inward abstract self from the concrete bodily existence of the individual, we have, in the outward manifestation, a proof of how the depths of his mind worked within him
- HoP 1",216
3555,"In him we see pre-eminently the inwardness of consciousness that in an anthropological way existed in the first instance in him, and became later on a usual thing
- HoP 1",170
3556,"He made his other campaign in Bœotia at Delium, a small fortification which the Athenians possessed not far from the sea, and where they had an unfortunate, though not an important engagement
- HoP 1",199
3557,"Here Socrates saved another of his favourites, Xenophon; he saw him in the flight, for Xenophon, having lost his horse, lay wounded on the ground
- HoP 1",153
3558,"Socrates took him over his shoulders, carried him off, defending himself at the same time with the greatest tranquillity and presence of mind from the pursuing enemy
- HoP 1",173
3559,"Finally he made his last campaign at Amphipolis in Edonis, on the Strymonian Bay119  Besides this, he occupied various civil offices
- HoP 1",140
3561,"Here he distinguished himself by his immovable firmness in what he held to be right as against the wills of the thirty tyrants, as formerly against the will of the people
- HoP 1",178
3563,"Socrates alone did not agree with this decision, declaring himself more emphatically against the people than against the rulers120 To-day he fares badly who says anything against the people
- HoP 1",197
3564,"His philosophy, which asserts that real existence is in consciousness as a universal, is still not a properly speculative philosophy, but remained individual; yet the aim of his philosophy was that it should have a universal significance
- HoP 1",245
3568,"It is well known that his appearance indicated naturally low and hateful qualities, which, as indeed he says, he himself subdued
- HoP 1",136
3569,"He lived amongst his fellow-citizens, and stands before us as one of those great plastic natures consistent through and through, such as we often see in those times—resembling a perfect classical work of art which has brought itself to this height of perfection
- HoP 1",269
3570,"Such individuals are not made, but have formed themselves into what they are; they have become that which they wished to be, and are true to this
- HoP 1",153
3572,"Such works of art are also seen in the great men of every time
- HoP 1",70
3574,"Pericles alone lived with the sole end of being a statesman
- HoP 1",67
3575,"Plutarch (in Pericle, c 5, 7) says of him that, from the time that he devoted himself to the business of the State, he laughed no more, and never again went to a feast
- HoP 1",175
3576,"Thus, too, Socrates formed himself, through his art and through the power of self-conscious will, into this particular character, and acquired this capacity for the business of his life
- HoP 1",193
3577,"Through his principle he attained that far-reaching influence which has lasted to the present day in relation to religion, science, and justice, for since his time the genius of inward conviction has been the basis which must be fundamental
- HoP 1",248
3578,"And since this principle proceeded from the plasticity of his character, it is very inappropriate when Tennemann regrets (Vol
- HoP 1",133
3579,"His indifference to money was due to his own determination, for, according to the custom of the times, he could acquire it through the education of youth, like other teachers
- HoP 1",182
3581,"For this was not yet a State affair; it was under the Roman emperors that there first were schools with payment
- HoP 1",119
3582,"This moderation of his life was likewise a power proceeding from conscious knowledge, but this is not a principle found to hand, but the regulation of self in accordance with circumstances; in company he was, however, a good fellow
- HoP 1",239
3583,"His sobriety in respect to wine is best depicted in Plato’s “Symposium,” in a very characteristic scene in which we see what Socrates called virtue
- HoP 1",155
3584,"Alcibiades there appears, no longer sober, at a feast given by Agathon, on the occasion of a success which his tragedy had obtained on the previous day at the games
- HoP 1",172
3585,"Since the company had drunk much on the first day of the feast, the assembled guests, amongst whom was Socrates, this evening took a resolution, in opposition to the Greek custom at meals, to drink little
- HoP 1",212
3589,"The intercourse is that of a most highly cultured man who, in his relation to others, never places anything personal in all his wit, and sets aside all that is unpleasant
- HoP 1",178
3590,"Thus Xenophon’s, but particularly Plato’s Socratic Dialogues belong to the highest type of this fine social culture
- HoP 1",123
3593,"This kind of intercourse was only possible in the Athenian mode of life, where most of the work which is now done by a free citizen—by a free republican and free imperial citizen alike—was performed by slaves, seeing that it was deemed unworthy of free men
- HoP 1",264
3594,"A free citizen could in Athens certainly be a handicraftsman, but he had slaves who did the work, just as a master now has workmen
- HoP 1",138
3595,"At the present day such a life of movement would not be suitable to our customs
- HoP 1",87
3597,"For amongst the Athenians and in Attic urbanity, this had no place, since it is not a reciprocal, free, and rational relationship
- HoP 1",137
3599,"In this conversation Socrates’ philosophy is found, as also what is known as the Socratic method, which must in its nature be dialectic, and of which we must speak before dealing with the content
- HoP 1",203
3600,"Socrates’ manner is not artificial; the dialogues of the moderns, on the contrary, just because no internal reason justifies their form, are necessarily tedious and heavy
- HoP 1",178
3601,"But the principle of his philosophy falls in with the method itself, which thus far cannot be called method, since it is a mode which quite coincides with the moralizing peculiar to Socrates
- HoP 1",198
3602,"For the chief content is to know the good as the absolute, and that particularly in relation to actions
- HoP 1",111
3605,"Then he led them on from a definite case to think of the universal, and of truths and beauties which had absolute value, since in every case, from the individual’s own thoughts, he derived the conviction and consciousness of that which is the definite right
- HoP 1",265
3607,"If we proceed from the general account of Socrates’ method to a nearer view, in the first place its effect is to inspire men with distrust towards their presuppositions, after faith had become wavering and they were driven to seek that which is, in themselves
- HoP 1",267
3609,"But in order to bring others to express these, he represents himself as in ignorance of them, and, with a seeming ingenuousness, puts questions to his audience as if they were to instruct him, while he really wished to draw them out
- HoP 1",240
3610,"This is the celebrated Socratic irony, which in his case is a particular mode of carrying on intercourse between one person and another, and is thus only a subjective form of dialectic, for real dialectic deals with the reasons for things
- HoP 1",246
3612,"Sometimes he also derived the opposite from a concrete case
- HoP 1",67
3613,"But as this opposite was a principle held by men as firmly as the other, he then went on to show that they contradicted themselves
- HoP 1",138
3614,"Thus Socrates taught those with whom he associated to know that they knew nothing; indeed, what is more, he himself said that he knew nothing, and therefore taught nothing
- HoP 1",179
3615,"It may actually be said that Socrates knew nothing, for he did not reach the systematic construction of a philosophy
- HoP 1",124
3616,"He was conscious of this, and it was also not at all his aim to establish a science
- HoP 1",91
3617,"On the one view, this irony seems to be something untrue
- HoP 1",64
3618,"But when we deal with objects which have a universal interest, and speak about them to one and to another, it is always the case that one does not understand another’s conception of the object
- HoP 1",200
3619,"For every individual has certain ultimate words as to which he presupposes a common knowledge
- HoP 1",101
3620,"But if we really are to come to an understanding, we find it is these presuppositions which have to be investigated
- HoP 1",123
3623,"Thus what would make an understanding possible is just the explanation of what we think is understood, without really being so
- HoP 1",134
3625,"For if I say I know what reason, what belief is, these are only quite abstract ideas; it is necessary, in order to become concrete, that they should be explained, and that it should be understood that what they really are, is unknown
- HoP 1",241
3626,"The irony of Socrates has this great quality of showing how to make abstract ideas concrete and effect their development, for on that alone depends the bringing of the Notion into consciousness
- HoP 1",201
3627,"In recent times much has been said about the Socratic irony which, like all dialectic, gives force to what is taken immediately, but only in order to allow the dissolution inherent in it to come to pass; and we may call this the universal irony of the world
- HoP 1",265
3628,"Yet men have tried to make this irony of Socrates into something quite different, for they extended it into a universal principle; it is said to be the highest attitude of the mind, and has been represented as the most divine
- HoP 1",233
3629,"It was Friedrich von Schlegel who first brought forward this idea, and Ast repeated it, saying, “The most ardent love of all beauty in the Idea, as in life, inspires Socrates’ words with inward, unfathomable life” This life is now said to be irony!
- HoP 1",256
3630,"But this irony issues from the Fichtian philosophy, and is an essential point in the comprehension of the conceptions of most recent times
- HoP 1",146
3632,"But the Greek gaiety, as it breathes in Homer’s poems, is ironical, for Eros mocks the power of Zeus and of Mars; Vulcan, limping along, serves the gods with wine, and brings upon himself the uncontrollable laughter of the immortal gods
- HoP 1",244
3633,"Juno boxes Diana’s ears
- HoP 1",31
3636,"Hypocrisy, which is of the same nature, is the truest irony
- HoP 1",67
3637,"Socrates and Plato were falsely stated to be the originators of this irony, of which it is said that it is the “inmost and deepest life,” although they possessed the element of subjectivity; in our time it was not permitted to us to give effect to this irony
- HoP 1",266
3638,"Ast’s “inmost, deepest life” is just the subjective and arbitrary will, the inward divinity which knows itself to be exalted above all
- HoP 1",142
3639,"The divine is said to be the purely negative attitude, the perception of the vanity of everything, in which my vanity alone remains
- HoP 1",139
3640,"Making the consciousness of the nullity of everything ultimate, might indeed indicate depth of life, but it only is the depth of emptiness, as may be seen from the ancient comedies of Aristophanes
- HoP 1",204
3641,"From this irony of our times, the irony of Socrates is far removed; as is also the case with Plato, it has a significance which is limited
- HoP 1",146
3642,"Socrates’ premeditated irony may be called a manner of speech, a pleasant rallying; there is in it no satirical laughter or pretence, as though the idea were nothing but a joke
- HoP 1",184
3643,"But his tragic irony is his opposition of subjective reflection to morality as it exists, not a consciousness of the fact that he stands above it, but the natural aim of leading men, through thought, to the true good and to the universal Idea
- HoP 1",250
3645,"Socrates hence adopts a questioning attitude, and this kind of questioning and answering has thus been called the Socratic method; but in this method there is more than can be given in questions and replies
- HoP 1",214
3647,"To Socrates those who reply may be called pliable youths, because they reply directly to the questions, which are so formed that they make the answer very easy, and exclude any originality in reply
- HoP 1",205
3649,"The other way, which is to bring forward another point of view, is undoubtedly the spirit of an animated conversation, but such emulation is excluded from this Socratic method, in which the principal matter is to keep to the point
- HoP 1",238
3651,"In these dialogues, it is hence not to be wondered at that those questioned answered so precisely to the point, while in the best modern dialogues there is always an arbitrary element
- HoP 1",191
3652,"This difference concerns only what is external and formal
- HoP 1",65
3654,"But this concrete, as it is in natural consciousness without thinking of it, or universality immersed in matter, he analyzed, so that through the separation of the concrete, he brought the universal contained therein to consciousness as universal
- HoP 1",254
3655,"It is the same method which forms in every man his knowledge of the universal; an education in self-consciousness, which is the development of reason
- HoP 1",157
3657,"We see such a development of universal from particular, where a number of examples are given, treated in a very tedious way
- HoP 1",131
3658,"For us who are trained in presenting to ourselves what is abstract, who are taught from youth up in universal principles, the Socratic method of so-called deference, with its eloquence, has often something tiresome and tedious about it
- HoP 1",243
3660,"If we reflect, for example, on the universally known idea of Becoming, we find that what becomes is not and yet it is; it is the identity of Being and non-being, and it may surprise us that in this simple conception so great a distinction should exist
- HoP 1",259
3662,"That these contradictions arise because they bring their ideas together, is the drift of the greater part of Socrates’ dialogues; their main tendency consequently was to show the bewilderment and confusion which exist in knowledge
- HoP 1",238
3663,"By this means, he tries to awaken shame, and the perception that what we consider as true is not the truth, from which the necessity for earnest effort after knowledge must result
- HoP 1",187
3664,"Plato, amongst others, gives these examples in his Meno (p 71-80, Steph
- HoP 1",79
3666,"Meno says “It is to govern and rule over others” Socrates brings forward the fact that the virtue of boys and slaves does not consist in governing
- HoP 1",154
3667,"Meno says that he cannot tell what is common in all virtue
- HoP 1",66
3668,"Socrates replies that it is the same as figure, which is what is common in roundness, squareness, &c There a digression occurs
- HoP 1",134
3669,"Meno says, “Virtue is the power of securing the good desired” Socrates interposes that it is superfluous to say the good, for from the time that men know that something is an evil, they do not desire it; and also the good must be acquired in a right way
- HoP 1",261
3670,"Socrates thus confounds Meno, and he sees that these ideas are false
- HoP 1",76
3671,"The latter says, “I used to hear of you, before I knew you, that you were yourself in doubt (ἀπορεῖς), and also brought others into doubt, and now you cast a spell on me too, so that I am at my wits’ end (ἀπορίας)
- HoP 1",221
3672,"You seem, if I may venture to jest, to be like the torpedo fish, for it is said of it that it makes torpid (ναρκᾷν) those who come near it and touch it
- HoP 1",159
3673,"You have done this to me, for I am become torpid in body and soul, and I do not know how to answer you, although I have talked thousands of times about virtue with many persons, and, as it seemed to me, talked very well
- HoP 1",227
3674,"But now I do not know at all what to say
- HoP 1",48
3675,"Hence you do well not to travel amongst strangers, for you might be put to death as a magician” Socrates again wishes to “inquire” Now Meno says, “How can you inquire about what you say you do not know?
- HoP 1",210
3676,"Can you have a desire for what you do not know?
- HoP 1",55
3677,"And if you find it out by chance, how can you know that it is what you looked for, since you acknowledge that, you do not know it?” A number of dialogues end in the same manner, both in Xenophon and Plato, leaving us quite unsatisfied as to the result
- HoP 1",259
3678,"It is so in the Lysis, where Plato asks the question of what love and friendship secures to men; and similarly the Republic commences by inquiring what justice is
- HoP 1",170
3679,"Philosophy must, generally speaking, begin with a puzzle in order to bring about reflection; everything must be doubted, all presuppositions given up, to reach the truth as created through the Notion
- HoP 1",207
3680,"This, in short, is Socrates’ method
- HoP 1",43
3682,"In this regard Socrates is opposed to the Sophists, for the proposition that man is the measure of all things, to them still comprehends particular ends, while to Socrates the universal brought forth through free thought is thereby expressed in objective fashion
- HoP 1",270
3684,"It now seems as if we had not yet shown forth much of the Socratic philosophy, for we have merely kept to the principle; but the main point with Socrates is that his knowledge for the first time reached this abstraction
- HoP 1",227
3685,"The Good is nevertheless no longer as abstract as the νοῦς of Anaxagoras, but is the universal which determines itself in itself, realizes itself, and has to be realized as the end of the world and of the individual
- HoP 1",223
3686,"It is a principle, concrete within itself, which, however, is not yet manifested in its development, and in this abstract attitude we find what is wanting in the Socratic standpoint, of which nothing that is affirmative can, beyond this, be adduced
- HoP 1",256
3687,"As regards the Socratic principle, the first determination is the great determination which is, however, still merely formal, that consciousness creates and has to create out of itself what is the true
- HoP 1",209
3689,"This religion of the Good is to Socrates, not only the essential point to which men have to direct their thoughts, but it is that exclusively
- HoP 1",149
3690,"We see him showing how from every individual this universal, this absolute in consciousness may be found as his reality
- HoP 1",127
3691,"Here we see law, the true and good, what was formerly present as an existent, return into consciousness
- HoP 1",111
3692,"But it is not a single chance manifestation in this individual Socrates, for we have to comprehend Socrates and his manifestation
- HoP 1",137
3693,"In the universal consciousness, in the spirit of the people to which he belongs, we see natural turn into reflective morality, and he stands above as the consciousness of this change
- HoP 1",190
3694,"The spirit of the world here begins to change, a change which was later on carried to its completion
- HoP 1",108
3695,"From this higher standpoint, Socrates, as well as the Athenian people and Socrates in them, have to be considered
- HoP 1",121
3696,"The reflection of consciousness into itself begins here, the knowledge of the consciousness of self as such, that it is real existence—or that God is a Spirit, or again, in a cruder and more sensuous form, that God takes human form
- HoP 1",239
3697,"This epoch begins where essence is given up as Being—even though it be, as hitherto, abstract Being, Being as thought
- HoP 1",125
3698,"But this epoch in a naturally moral people in the highest state of development, makes its appearance as the destruction threatening them or breaking in upon them unprevented
- HoP 1",181
3699,"For its morality, as was usually so with the ancients, consisted in the fact that the Good was present as a universal, without its having had the form of the conviction of the individual in his individual consciousness, but simply that of the immediate absolute
- HoP 1",269
3700,"It is the authoritative, present law, without testing investigation, but yet an ultimate ground on which this moral consciousness rests
- HoP 1",143
3701,"It is the law of the State; it has authority as the law of the gods, and thus it is universal destiny which has the form of an existent, and is recognized as such by all
- HoP 1",177
3702,"But moral consciousness asks if this is actually law in itself?
- HoP 1",71
3703,"This consciousness turned back within itself from everything that has the form of the existent, requires to understand, to know, that the above law is posited in truth, ie it demands that it should find itself therein as consciousness
- HoP 1",242
3704,"In thus returning into themselves the Athenian people are revealed to us: uncertainty as to existent laws as existent has arisen, and a doubt about what was held to be right, the greatest freedom respecting all that is and was respected
- HoP 1",244
3706,"This is a culture which we never find the Lacedæmonians reach
- HoP 1",69
3707,"This deepest life of morality is so to speak a free personal consciousness of morality or of God, and a happy enjoyment of them
- HoP 1",135
3708,"Consciousness and Being have here exactly the same value and rank; what is, is consciousness; neither is powerful above another
- HoP 1",135
3709,"The authority of law is no oppressive bond to consciousness, and all reality is likewise no obstacle to it, for it is secure in itself
- HoP 1",142
3710,"But this return is just on the point of abandoning the content, and indeed of positing itself as abstract consciousness, without the content, and, as existent, opposed to it
- HoP 1",181
3711,"From this equilibrium of consciousness and Being, consciousness takes up its position as independent
- HoP 1",108
3712,"This aspect of separation is an independent conception, because consciousness, in the perception of its independence, no longer immediately acknowledges what is put before it, but requires that this should first justify itself to it, ie it must comprehend itself therein
- HoP 1",278
3714,"The State has lost its power, which consisted in the unbroken continuity of the universal spirit, as formed of single individuals, so that the individual consciousness knew no other content and reality than law
- HoP 1",218
3715,"Morals have become shaken, because we have the idea present that man creates his maxims for himself
- HoP 1",107
3716,"The fact that the individual comes to care for his own morality, means that he becomes reflectively moral; when public morality disappears, reflective morality is seen to have arisen
- HoP 1",190
3717,"He also helped others to care for their morality, for he awakened in them this consciousness of having in their thoughts the good and true, ie having the potentiality of action and of knowledge
- HoP 1",201
3718,"This is no longer there immediately, but must be provided, just as a ship must make provision of water when it goes to places where none is to be found
- HoP 1",159
3719,"The immediate has no further authority but must justify itself to thought
- HoP 1",81
3720,"Thus we comprehend the special qualities of Socrates, and his method in Philosophy, from the whole; and we also understand his fate from the same
- HoP 1",153
3721,"This direction of consciousness back into itself takes the form—very markedly in Plato—of asserting that man can learn nothing, virtue included, and that not because the latter has no relation to science
- HoP 1",211
3722,"For the good does not come from without, Socrates shows; it cannot be taught, but is implied in the nature of mind
- HoP 1",122
3723,"That is to say, man cannot passively receive anything that is given from without like the wax that is moulded to a form, for everything is latent in the mind of man, and he only seems to learn it
- HoP 1",203
3724,"Certainly everything begins from without, but this is only the beginning; the truth is that this is only an impulse towards the development of spirit
- HoP 1",157
3725,"All that has value to men, the eternal, the self-existent, is contained in man himself, and has to develop from himself
- HoP 1",127
3726,"To learn here only means to receive knowledge of what is externally determined
- HoP 1",86
3727,"This external comes indeed through experience, but the universal therein belongs to thought, not to the subjective and bad, but to the objective and true
- HoP 1",161
3728,"The universal in the opposition of subjective and objective, is that which is as subjective as it is objective; the subjective is only a particular, the objective is similarly only a particular as regards the subjective, but the universal is the unity of both
- HoP 1",267
3729,"According to the Socratic principle, nothing has any value to men to which the spirit does not testify
- HoP 1",110
3730,"Man in it is free, is at home with himself, and that is the subjectivity of spirit
- HoP 1",90
3731,"As it is said in the Bible, “Flesh of my flesh, and bone of my bone,” that which is held by me as truth and right is spirit of my spirit
- HoP 1",144
3732,"But what spirit derives from itself must come from it as from the spirit which acts in a universal manner, and not from its passions, likings, and arbitrary desires
- HoP 1",172
3733,"These, too, certainly come from something inward which is “implanted in us by nature,” but which is only in a natural way our own, for it belongs to the particular; high above it is true thought, the Notion, the rational
- HoP 1",228
3734,"Socrates opposed to the contingent and particular inward, that universal, true inward of thought
- HoP 1",104
3735,"And Socrates awakened this real conscience, for he not only said that man is the measure of all things, but man as thinking is the measure of all things
- HoP 1",160
3736,"With Plato we shall, later on, find it formulated that what man seems to receive he only remembers
- HoP 1",106
3739,"It is such only through subjectivity, through the activity of man
- HoP 1",73
3740,"That the Good is a determinate thus further means that individuals know what the Good is, and we call this standpoint reflective morality, while natural morality does right unconsciously
- HoP 1",194
3741,"Thus to Socrates virtue is perception
- HoP 1",45
3743,"The naturally moral and upright man is such without his having considered the matter at all; it is his character, and what is good is securely rooted within him
- HoP 1",168
3744,"When, on the other hand, consciousness is concerned, the question arises as to whether I directly desire the good or not
- HoP 1",128
3745,"Hence this consciousness of morality easily becomes dangerous, and causes the individual to be puffed up by a good opinion of himself, which proceeds from the consciousness of his own power to decide for the good
- HoP 1",220
3746,"The ‘I’ is then the master, he who chooses the Good, and in that there is the conceit of my knowing that I am an excellent man
- HoP 1",134
3748,"He says: “Socrates spoke better of virtue than did Pythagoras, but not quite justly, for he made virtues into a science (ἐπιστήμας)
- HoP 1",139
3749,"But this is impossible, since, though all knowledge has some basis (λόγος) this basis only exists in thought
- HoP 1",116
3750,"Consequently, he places all the virtues in the thinking (λογιστικῷ) side of the soul
- HoP 1",92
3751,"Hence it comes to pass that he does away with the feeling (ἄλογον) part of the soul, that is, the inclination (πᾶθος) and the habits (ἠθος),” which, however, also pertain to virtue
- HoP 1",188
3752,"We see that what Aristotle misses in the determination of virtue in Socrates, is the side of subjective actuality, which we now call the heart
- HoP 1",150
3753,"Certainly virtue is determination in accordance with universal, and not with particular ends, but perception is not the only element in virtue
- HoP 1",150
3754,"For in order that the good perceived should be virtue, it must come to pass that the whole man, the heart and mind, should be identical with it, and this aspect of Being or of realization generally, is what Aristotle calls τὸ ἄλογον
- HoP 1",240
3755,"If we understand the reality of the good as universal morality, substantiality is wanting to the perception; but matter, when we regard the inclination of the individual subjective will as this reality
- HoP 1",209
3756,"This double want may also be considered as a want of content and of activity, in so far as to the universal development is wanting; and in the latter case, determining activity comes before us as negative only in reference to the universal
- HoP 1",247
3757,"Socrates thus omits, in characterizing virtue, just what we saw had also disappeared in actuality, that is, first the real spirit of a people, and then reality as the sympathies of the individual
- HoP 1",203
3758,"For it is just when consciousness is not yet turned back into itself, that the universal good appears to the individual as the object of his sympathy
- HoP 1",157
3759,"To us, on the other hand, because we are accustomed to put on one side the good or virtue as practical reason, the other side, which is opposed to a reflective morality, is an equally abstract sensuousness, inclination, passion, and hence the bad
- HoP 1",254
3760,"But in order that the universal should be reality, it must be worked out through consciousness as individual, and the carrying into effect pertains to this individuality
- HoP 1",177
3761,"A passion, as for example, love, ambition, is the universal itself, as it is self-realizing, not in perception, but in activity; and if we did not fear being misunderstood, we should say that for the individual the universal is his own interests
- HoP 1",253
3762,"Yet this is not the place in which to unravel all the false ideas and contradictions present in our culture
- HoP 1",115
3763,"For to call virtue scientific knowledge is untrue, but to say that it is not without scientific basis is right
- HoP 1",118
3764,"Socrates made virtues into perceptions (λόγους), but we say that virtue exists with perception” This is a very true distinction; the one side in virtue is that the universal of end belongs to thought
- HoP 1",207
3765,"But in virtue, as character, the other side, active individuality, real soul, must necessarily come forth; and indeed with Socrates the latter appears in a characteristic form of which we shall speak below (p 421 et seq)
- HoP 1",228
3766,"If we consider the universal first, it has within it a positive and a negative side, which we find both united in Xenophon’s “Memorabilia,” a work which aims at justifying Socrates
- HoP 1",188
3768,"But in regard to the content of his teaching and the point reached by him in the development of thought, we have in the main to look to Xenophon
- HoP 1",152
3769,"The fact that the reality of morality had become shaken in the mind of the people, came to consciousness in Socrates; he stands so high because he gave expression to what was present in the times
- HoP 1",203
3771,"To the Notion too, because to it the determinateness of laws in the form in which they have value to unperceiving consciousness has dissolved, only the purely implicit universal Good is the true
- HoP 1",202
3772,"But since this is empty and without reality, we demand, if we are not satisfied with a dull monotonous round, that again a movement should be made towards the extension of the determination of the universal
- HoP 1",214
3773,"Now because Socrates remains at the indeterminateness of the good, its determination means for him simply the expression of the particular good
- HoP 1",151
3776,"But since the dialectic sublates the particular, the abstract universal also becomes shaken
- HoP 1",99
3778,"That is, he showed them the good and true in what is determined, going back into it because he did not wish to remain in mere abstraction
- HoP 1",145
3779,"Xenophon gives an example of this (Memorab
- HoP 1",50
3780,"Socrates there asserts that the just man is he who obeys the law, and that these laws are divine
- HoP 1",104
3781,"Xenophon makes Hippias reply by asking how Socrates could declare it to be an absolute duty to obey the laws, for the people and the governors themselves often condemn them by changing them, which is allowing that they are not absolute
- HoP 1",243
3782,"But Socrates answers by demanding if those who conduct war do not again make peace, which is not, any more than in the other case, to condemn war, for each was just in its turn
- HoP 1",184
3783,"Socrates thus says, in a word, that the best and happiest State is that in which the citizens are of one mind and obedient to law
- HoP 1",137
3784,"Now this is the one side in which Socrates looks away from the contradiction and makes laws and justice, as they are accepted by each individually, to be the affirmative content
- HoP 1",185
3785,"But if we here ask what these laws are, they are, we find, just those which have a value at some one time, as they happen to be present in the State and in the idea; at another time they abrogate themselves as determined, and are not held to be absolute
- HoP 1",261
3786,"Euthydemus declares that this undoubtedly is so
- HoP 1",55
3787,"But without justice, replies Socrates, this is not possible, and he further asks whether Euthydemus had thus attained to justice in himself
- HoP 1",147
3788,"Euthydemus answers affirmatively, for he says that he thinks he is no less just than any other man
- HoP 1",106
3789,"Socrates now replies, “Just as workmen can show their work, the just will be able to say what their works are” This he also agrees to, and replies that he could easily do so
- HoP 1",181
3790,"Now Socrates asks, “But if a general subdues the enemy’s State, would this not be justice?” Euthydemus says “Yes” Socrates replies, “Likewise if he deceives and robs the enemy and makes slaves?” Euthydemus has to admit the justice of this
- HoP 1",246
3794,"Here we see that abstention from lying, deceit, and robbery, that which we naturally hold to be established, contradicts itself by being put into connection with something different, and something which holds equally good
- HoP 1",229
3795,"This example further explains how through thought, which would lay hold of the universal in the form of the universal only, the particular becomes uncertain
- HoP 1",164
3798,"Now whether the universal maxim in this particular case has value or not, depends first on the circumstances; and it is the perception which discovers the conditions and circumstances whereby exceptions to this law of unconditioned validity arise
- HoP 1",254
3799,"However, because through this contingency in the instances, the fixed nature of the universal principle disappears, since it, too, appears as a particular only, the consciousness of Socrates arrives at pure freedom in each particular content
- HoP 1",249
3800,"This freedom, which does not leave the content as it is in its dissipated determination to the natural consciousness, but makes it to be penetrated by the universal, is the real mind which, as unity of the universal content and of freedom, is the veritable truth
- HoP 1",270
3801,"Thus if we here consider further what is the true in this consciousness, we pass on to the mode in which the realization of the universal appeared to Socrates himself
- HoP 1",174
3802,"Even the uneducated mind does not follow the content of its consciousness as this content appears in it; but, as mind, it corrects that which is wrong in its consciousness, and is thus implicitly, if not explicitly as consciousness, free
- HoP 1",245
3803,"That is, though this consciousness expresses the universal law, “Thou shalt not kill,” as a duty, that consciousness—if no cowardly spirit dwells within it—will still bravely attack and slay the enemy in war
- HoP 1",215
3804,"Here, if it is asked whether there is a command to kill one’s enemies, the reply would be affirmative, as likewise when a hangman puts to death a criminal
- HoP 1",162
3805,"But when in private life we become involved with adversaries, this command to kill one’s enemies will not occur to us
- HoP 1",125
3806,"The first step towards reaching a spiritual consciousness is the negative one of acquiring freedom for one’s consciousness
- HoP 1",130
3807,"For since perception attempts to prove individual laws, it proceeds from a determination to which, as a universal basis, particular duty is submitted; but this basis is itself not absolute, and falls under the same dialectic
- HoP 1",232
3809,"The so-called conflict of duties is nothing but duty, which is expressed as absolute, showing itself as not absolute; in the constant contradiction morals become unsettled
- HoP 1",179
3810,"For a consciousness which has become consistent, law, because it has then been brought into contact with its opposite, has been sublated
- HoP 1",144
3811,"For the positive truth has not yet become known in its determination
- HoP 1",76
3812,"But to know the universal in its determination, ie the limitation of the universal which comes to us as fixed and not contingent, is only possible in connection with the whole system of actuality
- HoP 1",203
3813,"Thus if with Socrates the content has become spiritualized, yet manifold independent grounds have merely taken the place of manifold laws
- HoP 1",145
3814,"For the perception is not yet expressed as the real perception of these grounds over which it rules; but the truth of consciousness simply is this very movement of pure perception
- HoP 1",187
3815,"The true ground is, however, spirit, and the spirit of the people—a perception of the constitution of a people, and the connection of the individual with this real universal spirit
- HoP 1",188
3816,"Laws, morals, the actual social life, thus have in themselves their own corrective against the inconsistent, which consists of the expression of a definite content as absolute
- HoP 1",183
3817,"In ordinary life we merely forget this limitation of universal principles, and these still hold their place with us; but the other point of view is thus when the limitation comes before our consciousness
- HoP 1",211
3818,"Now both sides here present, the universal law and the deciding spirit which is in its abstraction the active individual, are also necessary to the consciousness of Socrates as the content and the power over this content
- HoP 1",228
3819,"That is, because with Socrates the particular law has become vacillating, there now comes in the place of the universal single mind, which, with the Greeks, was unconscious determination through unreflective morality, individual mind as individuality deciding for itself
- HoP 1",278
3820,"Thus with Socrates the deciding spirit is transformed into the subjective consciousness of man, since the power of deciding originates with himself; and the first question now is, how this subjectivity appears in Socrates himself
- HoP 1",237
3821,"Because the person, the individual, now gives the decision, we come back to Socrates as person, as subject, and what follows is a development of his personal relations
- HoP 1",175
3823,"Thus it was true that “the intercourse with his friends was, on the whole, beneficial and instructive to them, but in many cases they became unfaithful to Socrates,”129 because not everyone attains to perception, and he who possesses it may remain at the negative
- HoP 1",271
3824,"The education of the citizens, life in the people, is quite a fresh force in the individual, and does not mean that he educates himself through arguments; hence, however truly educative the intercourse with Socrates was, this contingency still entered into it
- HoP 1",267
3828,"But in this Genius of Socrates—notorious as a much discussed bizarrerie of his imagination—we are neither to imagine the existence of protective spirit, angel, and such-like, nor even of conscience
- HoP 1",205
3829,"For conscience is the idea of universal individuality, of the mind certain of itself, which is at the same time universal truth
- HoP 1",135
3830,"But the Genius of Socrates is rather all the other and necessary sides of his universality, that is, the individuality of mind which came to consciousness in him equally with the former
- HoP 1",193
3831,"His pure consciousness stands over both sides
- HoP 1",53
3832,"The deficiency in the universal, which lies in its indeterminateness, is unsatisfactorily supplied in an individual way, because Socrates’ judgment, as coming from himself, was characterized by the form of an unconscious impulse
- HoP 1",236
3833,"The Genius of Socrates is not Socrates himself, not his opinions and conviction, but an oracle which, however, is not external, but is subjective, his oracle
- HoP 1",165
3834,"It bore the form of a knowledge which was directly associated with a condition of unconsciousness; it was a knowledge which may also appear under other conditions as a magnetic state
- HoP 1",190
3835,"It may happen that at death, in illness and catalepsy, men know about circumstances future or present, which, in the understood relations of things, are altogether unknown
- HoP 1",179
3836,"These are facts which are usually rudely denied
- HoP 1",55
3837,"That in Socrates we should discover what comes to pass through reflection in the form of the unconscious, makes it appear to be an exceptional matter, revealed to the individual only, and not as being what it is in truth
- HoP 1",228
3839,"In connection with what follows, we must yet further consider the relationship of the Genius to the earlier existent form of decision, and that into which it led Socrates; regarding both Xenophon expresses himself in his history most distinctly
- HoP 1",252
3841,"But in them the Greeks, with all their freedom, did not decide from the subjective will
- HoP 1",95
3842,"The general or the people did not take upon themselves to decide as to what was best in the State, nor did the individual do so in the family
- HoP 1",149
3843,"For in making these decisions, the Greeks took refuge in oracles, sacrificial animals, soothsayers, or, like the Romans, asked counsel of birds in flight
- HoP 1",161
3844,"The general who had to fight a battle was guided in his decision by the entrails of animals, as we often find in Xenophon’s Anabasis
- HoP 1",140
3846,"This subjective freedom, which was not yet present with the Greeks, is what we mean in the present day when we speak of freedom; in the Platonic Republic we shall see more of it
- HoP 1",185
3847,"Our responsibility for what we do is a characteristic of modern times; we wish to decide according to grounds of common sense, and consider this as ultimate
- HoP 1",164
3848,"The Greeks did not possess the knowledge of this infinitude
- HoP 1",67
3849,"In the first book of Xenophon’s Memorabilia (chap
- HoP 1",57
3850,"I, §§ 7-9), on the occasion of the defence by Socrates of his δαιμόνιον, Socrates says at the very beginning: “The gods have reserved to themselves what is most important in knowledge
- HoP 1",191
3851,"Architecture, agriculture, forging, are human arts, as also government, the science of law, management of the household and generalship
- HoP 1",143
3852,"In all this man can attain to skill, but for the other, divination is necessary
- HoP 1",87
3854,"Nor does he who marries a wife know whether he will experience happiness or whether grief and sorrow will not come through this to him; neither can he who has powerful relations in the State, know whether, on account of these, he may not be banished from the State
- HoP 1",272
3855,"Because of this uncertainty, men have to take refuge in divination” Regarding it Xenophon expresses himself (ibid
- HoP 1",121
3857,"If anyone wishes to marry or to build a house, &c, the result is important to the individual only
- HoP 1",105
3858,"The truly divine and universal is the institution of agriculture, the state, marriage, &c; compared to this it is a trivial matter to know whether, when I go to sea, I shall perish or not
- HoP 1",195
3859,"The Genius of Socrates moreover reveals itself in him through nothing other than the counsel given respecting these particular issues, such as when and whether his friends ought to travel
- HoP 1",195
3860,"To anything true, existing in and for itself in art and science, he made no reference, for this pertains to the universal mind, and these dæmonic revelations are thus much more unimportant than those of his thinking mind
- HoP 1",228
3861,"There is certainly something universal in them, since a wise man can often foresee whether anything is advisable or not
- HoP 1",127
3862,"But what is truly divine pertains to all, and though talents and genius are also personal characteristics, they find their first truth in their works which are universal
- HoP 1",177
3863,"Now because with Socrates judgment from within first begins to break free from the external oracle, it was requisite that this return into itself should, in its first commencement, still appear in physiological guise (supra, pp
- HoP 1",235
3864,"The Genius of Socrates stands midway between the externality of the oracle and the pure inwardness of the mind; it is inward, but it is also presented as a personal genius, separate from human will, and not yet as the wisdom and free will of Socrates himself
- HoP 1",266
3866,"In modern times we have seen this in the form of a rigid eye, an inward knowledge, perception of this thing and that, of what is gone, of what is best to do, &c; but magnetism carries science no further than this
- HoP 1",220
3867,"The Genius of Socrates is thus to be taken as an actual state, and is remarkable because it is not morbid but was necessarily called up through a special condition of his consciousness
- HoP 1",192
3868,"For the turning point in the whole world-famed change of views constituting the principle of Socrates, is that in place of the oracle, the testimony of the mind of the individual has been brought forward and that the subject has taken upon itself to decide
- HoP 1",264
3869,"With this Genius of Socrates as one of the chief points of his indictment, we now enter upon the subject of his fate, which ends with his condemnation
- HoP 1",158
3870,"The contemporaries of Socrates, who came forward as his accusers before the Athenian people, laid hold on him as the man who made known that what was held as absolute was not absolute
- HoP 1",191
3872,"The spirit of this people in itself, its constitution, its whole life, rested, however, on a moral ground, on religion, and could not exist without this absolutely secure basis
- HoP 1",184
3873,"Thus because Socrates makes the truth rest on the judgment of inward consciousness, he enters upon a struggle with the Athenian people as to what is right and true
- HoP 1",171
3874,"His accusation was therefore just, and we have to consider this accusation as also the end of his career
- HoP 1",112
3875,"The attacks which Socrates experienced are well known, and were from two sources; Aristophanes attacked him in the “Clouds,” and then he was formally accused before the people
- HoP 1",183
3876,"Aristophanes regarded the Socratic philosophy from the negative side, maintaining that through the cultivation of reflecting consciousness, the idea of law had been shaken, and we cannot question the justice of this conception
- HoP 1",234
3877,"Aristophanes’ consciousness of the one-sidedness of Socrates may be regarded as a prelude to his death; the Athenian people likewise certainly recognized his negative methods in condemning him
- HoP 1",200
3879,"We have not here to consider the real nature of the Comedy of Aristophanes, nor the wanton way in which he was said to have treated Socrates
- HoP 1",148
3880,"As to the first, it should not startle us, nor do we require to justify Aristophanes or to excuse him
- HoP 1",109
3882,"Thus much can alone be said, that it certainly goes against our German seriousness to see how Aristophanes brings on the boards men living in the State, by name, in order to make a jest of them; and we feel this specially in regard to so upright a man as Socrates
- HoP 1",271
3883,"By chronological considerations, some have tried hard to refute the fact that Aristophanes’ representations had no influence on the condemnation of Socrates
- HoP 1",164
3884,"It is seen that, on the one hand, Socrates was treated quite unjustly; but then we must recognize the merit of Aristophanes, who in his “Clouds” was perfectly right
- HoP 1",172
3885,"This poet, who exposed Socrates to scorn in the most laughable and bitter way, was thus no ordinary joker and shallow wag who mocked what is highest and best, and sacrificed all to wit with a view to making the Athenians laugh
- HoP 1",234
3886,"For everything has to him a much deeper basis, and in all his jokes there lies a depth of seriousness
- HoP 1",109
3887,"He did not wish merely to mock; and moreover to mock what was worthy of honour would be perfectly bald and flat
- HoP 1",119
3888,"It is a pitiful wit which has no substance, and does not rest on contradictions lying in the matter itself
- HoP 1",114
3889,"But Aristophanes was no bad jester
- HoP 1",42
3890,"It is, generally speaking, not possible to joke in an external way about what does not contain matter for joking or irony in itself
- HoP 1",139
3891,"For what really is comic is to show a man or a thing as they disclose themselves in their extent; and if the thing is not itself its contradiction, the comic element is superficial and groundless
- HoP 1",203
3892,"Hence, when Aristophanes makes merry over the Democracy, there is a deep political earnestness at heart, and from all his works it appears what a noble, excellent, true Athenian citizen he was
- HoP 1",200
3893,"In him, as one who had a patriotism of the most enlightened kind, we find the blissful self-satisfied enjoyment of a people giving free rein to itself
- HoP 1",158
3895,"We enjoy in Aristophanes this side of the free Athenian spirit, this perfect enjoyment of itself in loss, this untroubled certainty of itself in all miscarriage of the result in real life, and this is the height of humour
- HoP 1",229
3896,"In the “Clouds” we do not indeed see this natural humour, but a contradiction with definite intention
- HoP 1",109
3898,"The wonderful perception which the followers of Socrates are here represented as having attained, is just a perception of the nullity of the laws of the determinate good as it is to the natural consciousness
- HoP 1",215
3899,"Aristophanes made fun of the fact that Socrates occupied himself with elementary researches as to how far fleas spring, and of his putting wax on their feet in order to discover this
- HoP 1",190
3900,"This is not historic, but it is well known that Socrates had in his philosophy the side which Aristophanes showed up with such acrimony
- HoP 1",143
3901,"Shortly, the fable of the “Clouds” is this: Strepsiades, an honourable Athenian citizen of the old school, had great trouble with his new-fashioned extravagant son, who, spoiled by mother and uncle, kept horses and led a life out of keeping with his position
- HoP 1",266
3902,"The father thus got into trouble with his creditors, and went in distress to Socrates, and became his disciple
- HoP 1",118
3903,"There the old man learned that not this or that, but another is the right, or rather he learned the stronger (κρείττων) and weaker reasons (ἕττων λόγος)
- HoP 1",160
3904,"He learned the dialectic of laws, and how, by reasoning, the payment of debts can be disregarded, and he then required that his son should go to the School of Socrates; and the latter likewise profited from his wisdom
- HoP 1",225
3905,"But we find the result ensuing from the universal which has now through the Socratic dialectic become empty, in the private interest or the wrong spirit of Strepsiades and his son, which spirit is merely the negative consciousness of the content of laws
- HoP 1",261
3906,"Equipped with this new wisdom of reasons, and the discovery of reasons, Strepsiades is armed against the chief evil that presses on him, as regards his threatening creditors
- HoP 1",181
3907,"These now come one after another to obtain payment
- HoP 1",58
3908,"But Strepsiades knows how to put them off with excellent reasons, and to argue them away, for he pacifies them by all sorts of titulos, and shows them that he does not need to pay them; indeed he even mocks them, and is very glad that he learned all this from Socrates
- HoP 1",276
3909,"But soon the scene changes, and the whole affair alters
- HoP 1",63
3910,"The son comes, behaves in a very unseemly way to his father, and finally beats him
- HoP 1",90
3911,"The father cries to the supreme power, as if this were the last indignity, but the son shows him, with equally good reasons, obtained by the method derived by him from Socrates, that he had a perfect right to strike him
- HoP 1",227
3912,"Strepsiades ends the comedy with execrations on the Socratic dialectic, with a return to his old ways, and with the burning of Socrates’ house
- HoP 1",150
3913,"The exaggeration which may be ascribed to Aristophanes, is that he drove this dialectic to its bitter end, but it cannot be said that injustice is done to Socrates by this representation
- HoP 1",194
3914,"Indeed we must admire the depth of Aristophanes in having recognized the dialectic side in Socrates as being a negative, and—though after his own way—in having presented it so forcibly
- HoP 1",192
3915,"For the power of judging in Socrates’ method is always placed in the subject, in conscience, but where this is bad, the story of Strepsiades must repeat itself
- HoP 1",167
3916,"A man like Socrates, who had made right” (right is not being discussed, but we may ask what right?
- HoP 1",106
3917,"This is foolish; it is a moral hypocrisy to pretend to be better than others who are then called enemies) “who are accustomed to act from quite different motives
- HoP 1",169
3919,"This phenomenon is probably explained by the fact that the enemies of Socrates had first of all to gain time in order to obtain a following, and that under the rule of the Thirty, they played too insignificant a part,” and so on
- HoP 1",236
3920,"Now, as regards the trial of Socrates, we have to distinguish two points, the one the matter of the accusation, the judgment of the court, and the other the relation of Socrates to the sovereign people
- HoP 1",209
3921,"In the course of justice there are thus these two parts—the relation of the accused to the matter on account of which he is accused, and his relation to the competency of the people, or the recognition of their majesty
- HoP 1",226
3922,"Socrates was found guilty by the judges in respect of the content of his accusation, but was condemned to death because he refused to recognize the competency and majesty of the people as regards the accused
- HoP 1",215
3924,"The first accusation has in part the same foundation, for he made it evident that what was usually so considered, was not acceptable to the gods; and in part it is to be taken in connection with his Dæmon, not that he called this his god
- HoP 1",245
3926,"But Socrates, who placed the contingency of judgment in himself, since he had his Dæmon in his own consciousness, thereby abolished the external universal Dæmon from which the Greeks obtained their judgments
- HoP 1",215
3927,"This accusation, as also Socrates’ defence, we wish now to examine further; Xenophon represents both to us, and Plato has also supplied us with an Apology
- HoP 1",162
3928,"Meanwhile we may not rest content with saying that Socrates was an excellent man who suffered innocently, &c (p 430), for in this accusation it was the popular mind of Athens that rose against the principle which became fatal to him
- HoP 1",240
3931,"That God knows the future beforehand, and, if He wishes, reveals it in these ways, all believe with him; but God can also reveal the future otherwise
- HoP 1",157
3932,"He could show that he did not lie in maintaining that he heard the voice of God, from the testimony of his friends, to whom he often announced what was said; and in its results this was always found to be true
- HoP 1",217
3934,"In our times this also happens in two ways
- HoP 1",50
3935,"Either the individual is not believed when he boasts of special manifestations, and particularly of manifestations which have to do with individual action and life; it is neither believed that such manifestations took place at all, or that they happened to this subject
- HoP 1",277
3936,"Or if anyone does have dealings with such divinations, rightly enough his proceedings are put an end to, and he is shut up
- HoP 1",130
3937,"By this it is not denied in a general way that God foreknows everything, or that He can make revelations to individuals; this may be admitted in abstracto, but not in actuality, and it is believed in no individual cases
- HoP 1",227
3938,"Men do not believe that to him, to this individual, there has been a revelation
- HoP 1",87
3939,"For why to him more than to others?
- HoP 1",43
3940,"And why just this trifle, some quite personal circumstances—as to whether someone should have a successful journey, or whether he should converse with another person, or whether or not he should in a speech properly defend himself?
- HoP 1",239
3941,"And why not others amongst the infinitely many things which may occur to the individual?
- HoP 1",96
3942,"Why not much more important things, things concerning the welfare of whole States?
- HoP 1",90
3943,"Hence it is not believed of an individual, in spite of the fact that if it is possible, it must be to the individual that it happens
- HoP 1",140
3944,"This unbelief, which thus does not deny the general fact and general possibility, but believes it in no particular case, really does not believe in the actuality and truth of the thing
- HoP 1",192
3945,"It does not believe it because the absolute consciousness—and it must be such—certainly knows nothing of a positive kind of trivialities such as form the subject of these divinations and also those of Socrates; in spirit such things immediately vanish away
- HoP 1",264
3946,"The absolute consciousness does not know about the future as such, any more than about the past; it knows only about the present
- HoP 1",136
3947,"But because in its present, in its thought, the opposition of future and past to present becomes apparent, it likewise knows about future and past, but of the past as something which has taken shape
- HoP 1",206
3948,"For the past is the preservation of the present as reality, but the future is the opposite of this, the Becoming of the present as possibility, and thus the formless
- HoP 1",173
3949,"From out of this formlessness the universal first comes into form in the present; and hence in the future no form can be perceived
- HoP 1",138
3950,"Men have the dim feeling that when God acts it is not in a particular way, nor for particular objects
- HoP 1",109
3951,"Such things are held to be too paltry to be revealed by God in a particular case
- HoP 1",88
3952,"It is acknowledged that God determines the individual, but by this the totality of individuality, or all individualities, is understood; hence it is said that God’s way of working is found in universal nature
- HoP 1",216
3955,"This his judges could not in justice tolerate, whether they believed it or not
- HoP 1",86
3957,"Thus Socrates is the hero who established in the place of the Delphic oracle, the principle that man must look within himself to know what is Truth
- HoP 1",155
3958,"Now seeing that Pythia herself pronounced that utterance, we find in it a complete revolution in the Greek mind, and the fact that in place of the oracle, the personal self-consciousness of every thinking man has come into play
- HoP 1",235
3959,"This inward certainty, however, is undoubtedly another new god, and not the god of the Athenians existing hitherto, and thus the accusation of Socrates was quite just
- HoP 1",174
3961,"Socrates explained himself further on this point when he left the court
- HoP 1",79
3962,"For Xenophon tells us (Apol
- HoP 1",35
3963,"Anytus was himself a tanner, and although his business was mostly conducted by slaves, it was in itself not ignominious, and Socrates’ expression was hence wrong, although, as we have seen (p 366), quite in the spirit of Greek thought
- HoP 1",242
3964,"Socrates added that he had made acquaintance with this son of Anytus and discovered no evil in him, but he prophesied that he would not remain at this servile work to which his father kept him
- HoP 1",200
3965,"Nevertheless, because he had no rational person near to look after him, he would come to have evil desires and be brought into dissolute ways
- HoP 1",149
3966,"Xenophon added that Socrates’ prophecy had come to pass literally, and that the young man gave himself up to drink, and drank day and night, becoming totally depraved
- HoP 1",174
3968,"The prediction of Socrates is thus quite natural
- HoP 1",56
3969,"To this definite accusation that he led sons into disobedience to their parents, Socrates replied by asking the question whether in selecting men for public offices, such as that of general, parents, or those experienced in war, were selected
- HoP 1",250
3970,"Similarly in all cases those most skilful in an art or science are picked out
- HoP 1",85
3972,"What his judges found unjust was the intrusion morally of a third into the absolute relation between parents and children
- HoP 1",129
3973,"On the whole not much can be said on this point, for all depends on the mode of intervention, and if it is necessary in certain cases, it need not take place generally, and least of all when some private individual takes that liberty
- HoP 1",241
3974,"Children must have the feeling of unity with their parents; this is the first immediately moral relationship; every teacher must respect it, keep it pure, and cultivate the sense of being thus connected
- HoP 1",210
3976,"The worst thing which can happen to children in regard to their morality and their mind, is that the bond which must ever be held in reverence should become loosened or even severed, thereby causing hatred, disdain, and ill-will
- HoP 1",236
3977,"Whoever does this, does injury to morality in its truest form
- HoP 1",69
3978,"This unity, this confidence, is the mother’s milk of morality on which man is nurtured; the early loss of parents is therefore a great misfortune
- HoP 1",153
3979,"The son, like the daughter, must indeed come out of his natural unity with the family and become independent, but the separation must be one which is natural or unforced, and not defiant and disdainful
- HoP 1",209
3980,"If we now speak of the example given us by Socrates, he seems, through his intervention, to have made the young man dissatisfied with his position
- HoP 1",154
3981,"Anytus’ son might, indeed, have found his work generally speaking uncongenial, but it is another thing when such dislike is brought into consciousness and established by the authority of a man such as Socrates
- HoP 1",217
3982,"We may very well conjecture that if Socrates had to do with him, he strengthened and developed in him the germ of the feeling of incongruity
- HoP 1",148
3983,"Socrates remarked on the subject of his capacities, saying that he was fit for something better, and thus established a feeling of dissatisfaction in the young man, and strengthened his dislike to his father, which thus became the reason of his ruin
- HoP 1",257
3984,"Hence this accusation of having destroyed the relationship of parents and children may be regarded as not unfounded, but as perfectly well established
- HoP 1",158
3985,"It was also thought very bad in Socrates’ case particularly, and made a matter of reproach that he had such followers as Critias and Alcibiades, who brought Athens almost to the brink of ruin (supra, p 421)
- HoP 1",214
3986,"For when he mixed himself in the education which others gave their children, men were justified in the demand that the result should not belie what he professed to do for the education of youth
- HoP 1",201
3987,"The only question now is, how the people came to take notice of this, and in how far such matters can be objects of legislation and be brought into court
- HoP 1",161
3988,"In our law, as regards the first part of the accusation, divination such as Cagliostro’s is illegal, and it would be forbidden as it formerly was by the Inquisition
- HoP 1",172
3990,"But should such questions come before the court?
- HoP 1",56
3991,"This first of all brings up the question of what is the right of the State, and here great laxity is now allowed
- HoP 1",120
3992,"Nevertheless, when some professor or preacher attacks a particular religion, the legislature would certainly take notice of it, and it would have a complete right to do so, although there would be an outcry when it did it
- HoP 1",229
3993,"There is undoubtedly a limit which in liberty of thought and speech is difficult to define and rests on tacit agreement; but there is a point beyond which we find what is not allowed, such as direct incitement to insurrection
- HoP 1",233
3994,"It is indeed said, that “bad principles destroy themselves by themselves and find no entrance” But that is only true in part, for with the populace the eloquence of sophistry stirs up their passions
- HoP 1",206
3995,"It is also said, “This is only theoretic, no action follows” But the State really rests on thought, and its existence depends on the sentiments of men, for it is a spiritual and not a physical kingdom
- HoP 1",208
3996,"Hence it has in so far maxims and principles which constitute its support, and if these are attacked, the Government must intervene
- HoP 1",139
3997,"Added to this, it was the case that in Athens quite a different state of things was present than with us; in order to be able to judge rightly of Socrates’ case we must first consider the Athenian State and its customs
- HoP 1",226
3999,"Hence it would undoubtedly in the first place mean the subversion of the Athenian State, if this public religion on which everything was built and without which the State could not subsist, went to pieces; with us the State may be called an absolute and independent power
- HoP 1",279
4000,"The Dæmon is now, in fact, a deity differing from any known, and because it stood in contradiction to the public religion, it gave to it a subjective arbitrariness
- HoP 1",171
4001,"But since established religion was identified with public life so closely that it constituted a part of public law, the introduction of a new god who formed self-consciousness into a principle and occasioned disobedience, was necessarily a crime
- HoP 1",253
4002,"We may dispute with the Athenians about this, but we must allow that they are consistent
- HoP 1",96
4003,"In the second place, the moral connection between parents and children is stronger, and much more the moral foundation of life with the Athenians than with us, where subjective freedom reigns; for family piety is the substantial key-note of the Athenian State
- HoP 1",267
4004,"Socrates thus attacked and destroyed Athenian life in two fundamental points; the Athenians felt and became conscious of it
- HoP 1",131
4005,"Is it then to be wondered at that Socrates was found guilty?
- HoP 1",68
4006,"We might say that it had to be so
- HoP 1",41
4008,"We here come to the second occurrence in his history
- HoP 1",60
4010,"In this penalty the punishment in itself is not brought into question, but only the kind of punishment; the judges had decided that Socrates deserved punishment
- HoP 1",168
4012,"Now Socrates declined to assign a punishment for himself consisting either of fine or banishment, and he had the choice between these and death, which his accusers proposed
- HoP 1",180
4013,"He declined to choose the former punishment because he, according to Xenophon’s account (Apol
- HoP 1",101
4015,"But the first submission would have meant that as the Athenians had found him guilty, he respected this decision, and acknowledged himself as guilty
- HoP 1",156
4016,"Consistently he would thus have held it better to impose his punishment, since thereby he would not only have submitted himself to the laws, but also to the judgment
- HoP 1",173
4017,"We see in Sophocles (Antig
- HoP 1",34
4018,"I, p 328) going round the citizens entreating for Aspasia and Anaxagoras
- HoP 1",80
4019,"In the Roman Republic we likewise find the noblest men begging of the citizens
- HoP 1",86
4020,"There is nothing dishonouring to the individual in this, for he must bend before the general power, and the real and noblest power is the people
- HoP 1",152
4021,"This acknowledgment the people must have direct from those who raise themselves amongst them
- HoP 1",100
4022,"Here, on the contrary, Socrates disclaims the submission to, and humiliation before the power of the people, for he did not wish to ask for the remission of his punishment
- HoP 1",179
4023,"We admire in him a moral independence which, conscious of its own right, insists upon it and does not bend either to act otherwise, or to recognize as wrong what it itself regards as right
- HoP 1",196
4025,"In a general way he certainly recognized the sovereignty of the people, but not in this individual case; it has, however, to be recognized, not only in general, but in each separate case
- HoP 1",194
4026,"But with the Athenians we find the characteristic request that the prisoner should, through the act of imposing on himself a penalty, sanction the judge’s sentence of guilt
- HoP 1",180
4027,"In England this is certainly not the case, but there still remains a like form of asking the accused by what law he wishes to be judged
- HoP 1",143
4028,"He then answers, by the law of the land and by the judges of his country
- HoP 1",80
4029,"Here we have the recognition of legal operations
- HoP 1",56
4030,"Socrates thus set his conscience in opposition to the judges’ sentence, and acquitted himself before its tribunal
- HoP 1",121
4031,"But no people, and least of all a free people like the Athenians, has by this freedom to recognize a tribunal of conscience which knows no consciousness of having fulfilled its duty excepting its own consciousness
- HoP 1",221
4033,"Quakers, Anabaptists, &c, who resist any demands made on them by the State, such as to defend the Fatherland, cannot be tolerated in a true State
- HoP 1",153
4034,"This miserable freedom of thinking and believing what men will, is not permitted, nor any such retreat behind personal consciousness of duty
- HoP 1",148
4035,"If this consciousness is no mere hypocrisy, in order that what the individual does should be recognized as duty, it must be recognized as such by all
- HoP 1",157
4036,"If the people can make mistakes the individual may do so much more easily, and he must be conscious that he can do this much more easily than the people
- HoP 1",160
4037,"Now law also has a conscience and has to speak through it; the law-court is the privileged conscience
- HoP 1",109
4039,"Men are too easily convinced of having fulfilled their duty, but the judge finds out whether duty is in fact fulfilled, even if men have the consciousness of its being so
- HoP 1",178
4040,"We should expect nothing else of Socrates than that he should go to meet his death in the most calm and manly fashion
- HoP 1",125
4041,"Plato’s account of the wonderful scene his last hours presented, although containing nothing very special, forms an elevating picture, and will be to us a permanent representation of a noble deed
- HoP 1",203
4042,"The last dialogue of Plato is popular philosophy, for the immortality of the soul is here first brought forward; yet it brings no consolation, for, as Homer makes Achilles say in the nether world, he would prefer to be a ploughboy on the earth
- HoP 1",251
4045,"The Athenian people were thus, not only justified, but also bound to react against it according to their law, for they regarded this principle as a crime
- HoP 1",161
4046,"In general history we find that this is the position of the heroes through whom a new world commences, and whose principle stands in contradiction to what has gone before and disintegrates it: they appear to be violently destroying the laws
- HoP 1",248
4047,"Hence individually they are vanquished, but it is only the individual, and not the principle, which is negated in punishment, and the spirit of the Athenian people did not in the removal of the individual, recover its old position
- HoP 1",238
4048,"The false form of individuality is taken away, and that, indeed, in a violent way, by punishment; but the principle itself will penetrate later, if in another form, and elevate itself into a form of the world-spirit
- HoP 1",223
4049,"This universal mode in which the principle comes forth and permeates the present is the true one; what was wrong was the fact that the principle came forth only as the peculiar possession of one individual
- HoP 1",213
4050,"His own world could not comprehend Socrates, but posterity can, in as far as it stands above both
- HoP 1",105
4052,"But it must be said that it was through the manner of that event that this principle became so highly honoured
- HoP 1",118
4053,"The principle is not merely something new and peculiar to itself, but it is an absolutely essential moment in the self-developing consciousness of self which is designed to bring to pass as a totality, a new and higher actuality
- HoP 1",236
4054,"The Athenians perceived correctly that this principle not only meant opinion and doctrine, for its true attitude was that of a direct and even hostile and destructive relation to the actuality of the Greek mind; and they proceeded in accordance with this perception
- HoP 1",273
4055,"Hence, what follows in Socrates’ life is not contingent, but necessarily follows upon his principle
- HoP 1",107
4056,"Or the honour of having recognized that relation, and indeed of having felt that they themselves were tinged with this principle, is due to the Athenians
- HoP 1",161
4057,"This is the last act in this drama
- HoP 1",42
4059,"In that they regretted the just judgment of Socrates, it seems to be implied that they wished that it had not occurred
- HoP 1",126
4060,"But from the regret it does not follow that in itself it should not have occurred, but only that it should not have happened for their consciousness
- HoP 1",156
4061,"Both together constitute the innocence which is guilty and atones for its guilt; it would only be senseless and despicable if there were no guilt
- HoP 1",153
4062,"An innocent person who comes off badly is a simpleton; hence it is a very flat and uninteresting matter when tyrants and innocent persons are represented in tragedies, just because this is an empty contingency
- HoP 1",217
4063,"A great man would be guilty and overcome the great crisis that ensues; Christ thus gave up his individuality, but what was brought forth by him remained
- HoP 1",160
4064,"The fate of Socrates is hence really tragic, not in the superficial sense of the word and as every misfortune is called tragic
- HoP 1",134
4065,"The death of an estimable individual must, in such a sense, be specially tragic, and thus it is said of Socrates, that because he was innocent and condemned to death, his fate was tragic
- HoP 1",194
4066,"But such innocent suffering would only be sad and not tragic, for it would not be a rational misfortune
- HoP 1",111
4067,"Misfortune is only rational when it is brought about by the will of the subject, who must be absolutely justified and moral in what he does, like the power against which he wars—which must therefore not be a merely natural power, or the power of a tyrannic will
- HoP 1",269
4068,"For it is only in such a case that man himself has any part in his misfortune, while natural death is only an absolute right which nature exercises over men
- HoP 1",164
4069,"Hence, in what is truly tragic there must be valid moral powers on both the sides which come into collision; this was so with Socrates
- HoP 1",142
4070,"His is likewise not merely a personal, individually romantic lot; for we have in it the universally moral and tragic fate, the tragedy of Athens, the tragedy of Greece
- HoP 1",175
4071,"Two opposed rights come into collision, and the one destroys the other
- HoP 1",78
4072,"Thus both suffer loss and yet both are mutually justified; it is not as though the one alone were right and the other wrong
- HoP 1",131
4073,"The one power is the divine right, the natural morality whose laws are identical with the will which dwells therein as in its own essence, freely and nobly; we may call it abstractly objective freedom
- HoP 1",208
4075,"It is these two principles which we see coming into opposition in the life and the philosophy of Socrates
- HoP 1",113
4076,"The Athenian people had come into a period of culture, in which this individual consciousness made itself independent of the universal spirit and became for itself
- HoP 1",171
4077,"This was perceived by them in Socrates, but at the same time it was felt that it meant ruin, and thus they punished an element which was their own
- HoP 1",154
4078,"The principle of Socrates is hence not the transgression of one individual, for all were implicated; the crime was one that the spirit of the people committed against itself
- HoP 1",181
4079,"Through this perception the condemnation of Socrates was retracted; Socrates appeared to have committed no crime, for the spirit of the people has now generally reached the consciousness which turns back from the universal into itself
- HoP 1",242
4080,"This meant the disintegration of this people, whose mind and spirit consequently soon disappeared from the world, but yet out of its ashes a higher took its rise, for the world-spirit had raised itself into a higher consciousness
- HoP 1",237
4081,"The Athenian State, indeed, endured for long, but the bloom of its character soon faded
- HoP 1",95
4082,"It is characteristic of Socrates that he grasped the principle of the inwardness of knowledge, not practically merely, as did Critias and Alcibiades (supra, pp
- HoP 1",167
4083,"Knowledge brought about the Fall, but it also contains the principle of Redemption
- HoP 1",90
4084,"Thus what to others was only ruin, to Socrates, because it was the principle of knowledge, was also a principle of healing
- HoP 1",130
4086,"From this it came to pass that particularity of ends and interests now became powerful in Athens
- HoP 1",104
4087,"This has, in common with the Socratic principle, the fact that what seems right and duty, good and useful to the subject in relation to himself as well as to the State, depends on his inward determination and choice, and not on the constitution and the universal
- HoP 1",270
4089,"The Athenian life became weak, and the State outwardly powerless, because its spirit was divided within itself
- HoP 1",118
4090,"Hence it was dependent on Lacedæmon, and we finally see the external subordination of these States to the Macedonians

4092,"I have been more detailed here because all the features of the case have been so completely in harmony, and he constitutes a great historic turning point
- HoP 1",161
4093,"He saw Athens in its greatness and the beginning of its fall; he experienced the height of its bloom and the beginning of its misfortunes
- HoP 1",145
4094,"The result of the death of Socrates was, that the little company of his friends went off from Athens to Megara, where Plato also came
- HoP 1",141
4095,"Euclides had settled there and received them gladly142 When Socrates’ condemnation was retracted and his accusers punished, certain of the Socratics returned, and all was again brought into equilibrium
- HoP 1",209
4096,"The work of Socrates was far-reaching and effectual in the kingdom of Thought, and the stimulation of a great amount of interest is always the principal service of a teacher
- HoP 1",181
4097,"Subjectively, Socrates had the formal effect of bringing about a discord in the individual; the content was subsequently left to the free-will and liking of each person, because the principle was subjective consciousness and not objective thought
- HoP 1",254
4100,"For when all present speculative philosophy expresses the universal as essence, this, as it first appears, has the semblance of being a single determination, beside which there are a number of others
- HoP 1",207
4101,"It is the complete movement of knowledge that first removes this semblance, and the system of the universe then shows forth its essence as Notion, as a connected whole
- HoP 1",175
4102,"The most varied schools and principles proceeded from this doctrine of Socrates, and this was made a reproach against him, but it was really due to the indefiniteness and abstraction of his principle
- HoP 1",207
4103,"And in this way it is only particular forms of this principle which can at first be recognized in philosophic systems which we call Socratic
- HoP 1",148
4104,"Under the name of Socratic, I understand, however, those schools and methods which remained closer to Socrates and in which we find nothing but the one-sided understanding of Socratic culture
- HoP 1",199
4105,"One part of these kept quite faithfully to the direct methods of Socrates, without going any further
- HoP 1",108
4107,"But for the rest they abstained from speculative research, and by directing their attention to what was practical, adhered firmly and faithfully to the fulfilment of the duties of their position and circumstances, thereby maintaining calm and satisfaction
- HoP 1",263
4108,"Xenophon is the most celebrated of those mentioned, but besides him a number of other Socratics wrote dialogues
- HoP 1",119
4109,"But another section of the Socratics went further than Socrates, inasmuch as they, starting from him, laid hold of and matured one of the particular aspects of his philosophy and of the standpoint to which philosophic knowledge was brought through him
- HoP 1",259
4110,"This standpoint maintained the absolute character of self-consciousness within itself, and the relation of its self-existent universality to the individual
- HoP 1",163
4111,"In Socrates, and from him onward, we thus see knowledge commencing, the world raising itself into the region of conscious thought, and this becoming the object
- HoP 1",167
4112,"We hence have the question of the relationship of self-conscious thought to real essence coming to the front as what concerns us most
- HoP 1",141
4113,"The true and essence are not the same; the true is essence as thought, but essence is the simply implicit
- HoP 1",113
4115,"Or it is the simple unity of the objective and of thought; it is not purely objective—for Being cannot be seen, heard, &c; nor is it pure thought in opposition to the existent—for this is the explicitly existent self-consciousness which separates itself from essence
- HoP 1",274
4116,"It is finally not the unity going back into itself from the difference in the two sides, which is understanding and knowledge
- HoP 1",133
4117,"In these self-consciousness on the one hand presents itself as being-for-self, and on the other, as Being; it is conscious of this difference, and from this difference turns back into the unity of both
- HoP 1",209
4118,"This unity, the result, is the known, the true
- HoP 1",54
4119,"One element in the true is the certainty of itself; this moment has attained to reality—in consciousness and for consciousness
- HoP 1",134
4120,"It is through this movement and the investigation of the subject, that the succeeding period of Philosophy is distinguished, because it does not contemplate essence as left to itself, and as purely objective, but as in unity with the certainty of itself
- HoP 1",261
4122,"And this period is hence, so to speak, the middle period, which is really the movement of knowledge, and considers knowledge as the science of essence, which first brings about that unity
- HoP 1",195
4123,"From what has been said, it can now be seen what philosophic systems can come before us
- HoP 1",95
4128,"The Megarics were most abstract, because they held to the determination of the good which, as simple, was to them the principle; the unmoved and self-related simplicity of thought becomes the principle of consciousness as individual, as it is of conscious knowledge
- HoP 1",273
4129,"The Megaric school associated with the assertion of the simplicity of the good, the dialectic, that all that was defined and limited is not true
- HoP 1",152
4132,"Now because they thereby sought to define the Good more closely, they called it simply pleasure or enjoyment, by which, however, anything can be understood
- HoP 1",163
4133,"This principle of the Cyrenaic school would seem to have been far removed from that of Socrates, since we at once think of the transient existence of feeling as directly in opposition to the Good; this, however, is not the case
- HoP 1",235
4135,"The Cynics also further defined the principle of the Good, but in another way from the Cyrenaics; its content, they said, lay in man’s keeping to what is in conformity with nature and to the simple needs of nature
- HoP 1",221
4136,"They similarly call all that is particular and limited in the aims of men that which is not to be desired
- HoP 1",113
4138,"Thus we see pure thought recognized in its movement with the individual, and the manifold transformations of the universal coming to consciousness
- HoP 1",154
4139,"These three schools are not to be treated at length
- HoP 1",59
4140,"The principle of the Cyrenaics became later on more scientifically worked out in Epicureanism, as that of the Cynics did in Stoicism
- HoP 1",140
4142,"But this was only partly true—in that the Eleatic dialecticians maintained Being as the one existence in relation to which nothing particular is a truth, and the Megarics considered Being as the Good
- HoP 1",207
4143,"The Sophists, on the other hand, did not seek their impulse in simple universality as fixed and as enduring; and similarly we shall find in the Sceptics, dialecticians who maintain that the subjective mind rests within itself
- HoP 1",233
4147,"But what is opposed to the good does not exist”147 This doctrine Cicero (ibid)
- HoP 1",86
4149,"Thus they come into the category of the Eleatics, since they, like them, showed that only Being is, and that all else, as negative, does not exist
- HoP 1",154
4150,"Of their own dialectic not much is told, but more is said of the embarrassment into which they brought ordinary consciousness, for they were in all kinds of ways alert in involving others in contradictions
- HoP 1",213
4151,"Thus they applied dialectic after the manner of an ordinary conversation, just as Socrates applied his mind to every side of ordinary subjects, and as we also, in our conversation, try to make an assertion interesting and important
- HoP 1",239
4152,"A number of anecdotes are told of their disputations, from which we see that what we call joking was their express business
- HoP 1",131
4153,"Others of their puzzles certainly deal with a positive category of thought; they take these and show how, if they are held to be true, they bring about a contradiction
- HoP 1",175
4155,"Hence we call them stupid, and look at them as dreary jokes, but it is in fact easier to set them aside than to refute them
- HoP 1",131
4156,"To confuse ordinary language so that we do not know how to reply, seems foolish, as leading to formal contradictions, and if it is done we are blamed for taking mere empty words and playing upon them
- HoP 1",207
4157,"Our German seriousness, therefore, dismisses this play on words as shallow wit, but the Greeks honoured the word in itself, and the mere treatment of a proposition as well as the matter
- HoP 1",193
4158,"And if word and thing are in opposition, the word is the higher, for the unexpressed thing is really irrational, since the rational exists as speech alone
- HoP 1",162
4159,"It is in Aristotle, and in his Sophistical Elenchi that we first find numerous examples of these contradictions (coming from the old Sophists equally with the Eristics), and also their solutions
- HoP 1",202
4160,"Eubulides, therefore, likewise wrote against Aristotle,149 but none of this has come down to us
- HoP 1",103
4161,"In Plato we also find, as we saw before (p 370), similar jokes and ambiguities mentioned to make the Sophists ridiculous, and to show with what insignificant matters they took up their time
- HoP 1",197
4163,"Just as the Queen of the East came to Solomon to put riddles to him, we find at the tables of kings witty conversation and assemblages of philosophers joking and making merry over one another
- HoP 1",199
4164,"The Greeks were quite enamoured of discovering contradictions met with in speech and in ordinary ideas
- HoP 1",110
4165,"The contradiction does not make its appearance as a pure contradiction in the conception, but only as interwoven with concrete ideas; such propositions neither apply to the concrete content nor to the pure Notion
- HoP 1",220
4166,"Subject and predicate, of which every proposition consists, are different, but in the ordinary idea we signify their unity; this simple unity, which does not contradict itself, is to ordinary ideas the truth
- HoP 1",215
4167,"But in fact, the simple self-identical proposition is an unmeaning tautology; for in any affirmation, differences are present, and because their diversity comes to consciousness, there is contradiction
- HoP 1",209
4168,"But the ordinary consciousness is then at an end, for only where there is a contradiction is there the solution, self-abrogation
- HoP 1",136
4170,"In Eubulides’ propositions the main point was that because the truth is simple, a simple answer is required; that thus the answer should not, as happened in Aristotle (De Sophist
- HoP 1",186
4171,"Thus the mistake is to desire an answer of yes or no, for since no one ventures on either, perplexity ensues, because it is a fool’s part not to know what to reply
- HoP 1",171
4172,"The simplicity of the truth is thus grasped as the principle
- HoP 1",68
4173,"That is the first principle of the understanding, the principium exclusi tertii, which is of great importance in all the sciences
- HoP 1",137
4174,"This stands in close connection with the principle of Socrates and Plato (supra, pp
- HoP 1",91
4175,"This comes more clearly to light in Stilpo (p 464)
- HoP 1",58
4176,"The Megarics thus kept to this principle of our logic of the understanding, in demanding the form of identity for the Truth
- HoP 1",131
4177,"Now in the cases that they put, they did not keep to the universal, but sought examples in ordinary conception, by means of which they perplexed people; and this they formed into a kind of system
- HoP 1",203
4178,"We shall bring forward some examples that are preserved to us; some are more important, but others are insignificant
- HoP 1",124
4179,"One Elench was called the Liar (ψευδόμενος); in it the question is put: “If a man acknowledges that he lies, does he lie or speak the truth?”151 A simple answer is demanded, for the simple whereby the other is excluded, is held to be the true
- HoP 1",250
4180,"If it is said that he tells the truth, this contradicts the content of his utterance, for he confesses that he lies
- HoP 1",123
4181,"But if it is asserted that he lies, it may be objected that his confession is the truth
- HoP 1",95
4182,"He thus both lies and does not lie; but a simple answer cannot be given to the question raised
- HoP 1",102
4183,"For here we have a union of two opposites, lying and truth, and their immediate contradiction; in different forms this has at all times come to pass, and has ever occupied the attention of men
- HoP 1",200
4184,"They seek a simple relation from something incommensurable, ie they fall into the error of demanding a simple reply where the content is contradictory

4185,"That little history has perpetuated and reproduced itself later on; in Don Quixote the very same thing appears
- HoP 1",118
4186,"Sancho, governor of the island of Barataria, was tested by many insidious cases as he sat in judgment, and, amongst others, with the following: In his domain there was a bridge which a rich man had erected for the good of passengers—but with a gallows close by
- HoP 1",268
4187,"The crossing of the bridge was restricted by the condition that everyone must say truly where he was going, and if he lied, he would be hung upon the gallows
- HoP 1",165
4188,"Now one man came to the bridge, and to the question whither he went, answered that he had come here to be hung on the gallows
- HoP 1",133
4189,"The bridge-keepers were much puzzled by this
- HoP 1",52
4190,"For if they hanged him, he would have spoken the truth and ought to have passed, but if he crossed he would have spoken an untruth
- HoP 1",138
4191,"In this difficulty they applied to the wisdom of the governor, who uttered the wise saying that in such dubious cases the mildest measures should be adopted, and thus the man should be allowed to pass
- HoP 1",208
4192,"Sancho did not break his head over the matter
- HoP 1",53
4193,"The result which the statement was to have, is made its content, with the condition that the opposite of the content should be the consequence
- HoP 1",150
4194,"Hanging, understanding it to be truly expressed, should not have hanging as result; non-hanging as an event, should, on the other hand, have hanging as result

4195,"Thus death is made the consequence of suicide, but by suicide death itself is made into the content of the crime, and cannot thus be the punishment

- HoP 1",65
4197,"Menedemus was asked whether he had ceased to beat his father
- HoP 1",68
4198,"This was an attempt to place him in a difficulty, since to answer either yes or no, would be equally risky

4199,"For if he said ‘yes,’ then he once beat him, and if ‘no,’ then he still beats him
- HoP 1",89
4201,"If the consciousness of opposition is present, our ordinary ideas keep the contradictory sides apart; but in fact the contradiction appears in sensuous things, such as space, time, &c, and has in them only to be demonstrated
- HoP 1",232
4202,"These sophisms thus not only appear to be contradictory, but are so in truth: this choice between two opposites, which is set before us in the example, is itself a contradiction
- HoP 1",185
4203,"The Concealed one (διαλανθάνων) and the Electra155 proceed from the contradiction of knowing and not knowing someone at the same time

4204,"I ask someone ‘Do you know your father?’ He replies ‘Yes’ I then ask ‘Now if I show you someone hidden behind a screen, will you know him?’ ‘No’ ‘But it is your father, and thus you do not know your father’ It is the same in the Electra
- HoP 1",244
4205,"The son thus knows his father when he sees him, ie when he is a ‘this’ for him; but hidden, he is not a ‘this’ for him, but a ‘this’ abrogated
- HoP 1",150
4207,"In this way there enters into these histories the higher opposition of the universal and of the ‘this,’ in as far as to have in the ordinary idea, means in the element of the universal; the abrogated ‘this’ is not only an idea, but has its truth in the universal
- HoP 1",270
4208,"The universal is thus found in the unity of opposites, and thus it is in this development of Philosophy the true existence, in which the sensuous being of the ‘this’ is negated
- HoP 1",184
4209,"It is the consciousness of this in particular which, as we shall soon see (p 465), is indicated by Stilpo

- HoP 1",66
4212,"It is asked, “Does one grain of corn make a heap, or does one hair less make a bald head?” The reply is “No” “Nor one again?” “No, it does not” This question is now always repeated while a grain is always added, or a hair taken away
- HoP 1",240
4213,"When at last it is said that there is a heap or a bald head, it is found that the last added grain or last abstracted hair has made the heap or the baldness, and this was at first denied
- HoP 1",194
4214,"But how can a grain form a heap which already consists of so many grains?
- HoP 1",81
4215,"The assertion is that one grain does not make a heap; the contradiction, that one thus added or taken away brings about the change into the opposite—the many
- HoP 1",165
4216,"For to repeat one is just to obtain many, the repetition causes certain ‘many’ grains to come together
- HoP 1",110
4217,"The one thus becomes its opposite,—a heap, and the taking of one away brings about baldness

4237,"Hence it is not of this one” That man is the universal, and that no one is specially indicated, everyone readily acknowledges, but some one still remains present to us in our conception

- HoP 1",138
4241,"And the fact that the form of universality is maintained, is further expressed in a number of anecdotes which are taken by Stilpo from common life

4247,"That the universal should in Philosophy be given a place of such importance that only the universal can be expressed, and the ‘this’ which is meant, cannot, indicates a state of consciousness and thought which the philosophic culture of our time has not yet reached

4284,"He heard of him either in Cyrene or at the Olympian Games, which, as Greeks, the Cyrenians likewise visited
- HoP 1",115
4285,"His father was a merchant, and he himself came to Athens on a journey which had commerce as its object
- HoP 1",110
4287,"The character and personality of Aristippus is what is most important, and what is preserved to us in his regard is his manner and life rather than his philosophic doctrines
- HoP 1",181
4288,"He sought after enjoyment as a man of culture, who in that very way had raised himself into perfect indifference to all that is particular, all passions and bonds of every kind
- HoP 1",184
4289,"When pleasure is made the principle, we immediately have the idea before us that in its enjoyment we are dependent, and that enjoyment is thus opposed to the principle of freedom
- HoP 1",186
4290,"But neither of the Cyrenaic teaching, nor the Epicurean, whose principle is on the whole the same, can this be stated
- HoP 1",125
4292,"Aristippus certainly esteemed culture at its highest, and proceeded from this position—that pleasure is only a principle for men of philosophic culture; his main principle thus was that what is found to be pleasant is not known immediately but only by reflection
- HoP 1",270
4293,"Aristippus lived in accordance with these principles, and what in him interests us most is the number of anecdotes told about him, because they contain traces of a mentally rich and free disposition
- HoP 1",206
4295,"He enjoyed, says Diogenes, the pleasures of the moment, without troubling himself with those which were not present; he suited himself to every condition, being at home in all; he remained the same whether he were in regal courts or in the most miserable conditions
- HoP 1",273
4296,"Plato is said to have told him that it was given to him alone to wear the purple and the rags
- HoP 1",101
4297,"He was specially attached to Dionysius, being very popular with him; he certainly clung to him, but always retained complete independence
- HoP 1",145
4298,"Diogenes, the Cynic, for this reason called him the royal dog
- HoP 1",69
4299,"He made nothing of the possession of money as contrasted with the results which appear to follow from pursuing pleasure, and hence he wasted it on dainties
- HoP 1",163
4300,"He once bought a partridge at fifty drachms (about twenty florins)
- HoP 1",74
4301,"This is not quite wrong, for man is what he ought to be as man, through culture; it is his second nature through which he first enters into possession of that which he has by nature, and thus for the first time he is Mind
- HoP 1",229
4303,"A distinction is now made between the true, the valid, what exists in and for itself, and the practical and good, and what ought to be our end; but in regard to both the theoretic and practical truth, the Cyrenaics make sensation what determines
- HoP 1",253
4304,"Hence their principle is more accurately not the objective itself, but the relation of consciousness to the objective; the truth is not what is in sensation the content, but is itself sensation, it is not objective, but the objective subsists only in it
- HoP 1",261
4305,"Thus when we perceive a white and sweet, we may assert this condition as ours with truth and certainty
- HoP 1",110
4306,"But that the causes of these feelings are themselves a white and sweet object we cannot with certainty affirm
- HoP 1",117
4307,"What these men say about ends is also in harmony with this, for sensations also extend to ends
- HoP 1",102
4308,"The sensations are either pleasant or unpleasant or neither of the two
- HoP 1",78
4309,"Now they call the unpleasant feelings the bad, the end of which is pain; the pleasant is the good, whose invariable end is happiness
- HoP 1",140
4310,"Thus feelings are the criteria of knowledge and the ends for action
- HoP 1",75
4313,"And thus the idea of the wise man results—what the wise do, who the wise are, &c The reason that these two expressions are now so prominent is one which rests on what has gone before
- HoP 1",190
4314,"On the one hand the main interest is to find a content for the good, for else men may talk about it for years
- HoP 1",117
4315,"This further definition of the good is just the criterion
- HoP 1",65
4316,"On the other hand the interest of the subject appears, and that is the result of the revolution in the Greek mind made by Socrates
- HoP 1",138
4317,"When the religion, constitution, laws of a people, are held in esteem, and when the individual members of a people are one with them, the question of what the individual has to do on his own account, will not be put
- HoP 1",223
4318,"In a moralized, religious condition of things we are likely to find the end of man in what is present, and these morals, religion and laws are also present in him
- HoP 1",170
4319,"When, on the contrary, the individual exists no longer in the morality of his people, no longer has his substantial being in the religion, laws, &c, of his land, he no longer finds what he desires, and no longer satisfies himself in his present
- HoP 1",252
4320,"But if this discord has arisen, the individual must immerse himself in himself, and there seek his end
- HoP 1",110
4321,"Now this is really the cause that the question of what is the essential for the individual arises
- HoP 1",105
4322,"After what end must he form himself and after what strive?
- HoP 1",66
4323,"Thus an ideal for the individual is set up, and this is the wise man: what was called the ideal of the wise man is the individuality of self-consciousness which is conceived of as universal essence
- HoP 1",205
4324,"The point of view is the same when we now ask, What can I know?
- HoP 1",71
4325,"What should I believe?
- HoP 1",30
4326,"What ought I to hope?
- HoP 1",29
4327,"What is the highest interest of the subject?
- HoP 1",52
4329,"This talk about wise men is universal amongst the Stoics, Epicureans, &c, but is devoid of meaning
- HoP 1",106
4330,"For the wise man is not in question, but the wisdom of the universe, real reason
- HoP 1",88
4331,"A third definition is that the universal is the good; the real side of things is enjoyment and happiness as a simple existence and immediate actuality
- HoP 1",158
4332,"How then do the two agree?
- HoP 1",34
4333,"The philosophic schools which now arise and their successors have set forth the harmony of both determinations, which are the higher Being and thought
- HoP 1",158
4334,"Of the later Cyrenaics, Theodorus must be mentioned first; he is famous for having denied the existence of the gods, and being, for this reason, banished from Athens
- HoP 1",173
4335,"Such a fact can, however, have no further interest or speculative significance, for the positive gods which Theodorus denied, are themselves not any object of speculative reason
- HoP 1",185
4336,"He made himself remarkable besides for introducing the universal more into the idea of that which was existence for consciousness, for “he made joy and sorrow the end, but in such a way that the former pertained to the understanding and the latter to want of understanding
- HoP 1",280
4338,"For the sensuous generally, as sensation, theoretic or practical, is something quite indeterminate, this or that unit; a criticism of this unit is hence required, ie it must be considered in the form of universality, and hence this last necessarily reappears
- HoP 1",266
4339,"But this advance on individuality is culture, which, through the limitation of individual feelings and enjoyments, tries to make these harmonious, even though it first of all only calculates as to that by which the greater pleasure is to be found
- HoP 1",254
4341,"Theodorus comprehended this as understanding and justice, in which we know where to seek enjoyment
- HoP 1",106
4342,"But when it is said that felicity must be sought by reflection, we know that these are empty words and thoughtless utterances
- HoP 1",133
4343,"For the feeling in which felicity is contained, is in its conception the individual, self-changing, without universality and subsistence
- HoP 1",144
4344,"Thus the universal, understanding, as an empty form, adheres to a content quite incongruous with it; and thus Theodorus distinguished the Good in its form, from the end as the Good in its nature and content
- HoP 1",214
4345,"It is remarkable that another Cyrenaic, Hegesias, recognized this incongruity between sensation and universality, which last is opposed to the individual, having what is agreeable as well as disagreeable within itself
- HoP 1",225
4346,"Because, on the whole, he took a firmer grasp of the universal and gave it a larger place, there passed from him all determination of individuality, and with it really the Cyrenaic principle
- HoP 1",198
4347,"It came to his knowledge that individual sensation is in itself nothing; and, as he nevertheless made enjoyment his end, it became to him the universal
- HoP 1",159
4348,"But if enjoyment is the end, we must ask about the content; if this content is investigated, we find every content a particular which is not in conformity with the universal, and thus falls into dialectic
- HoP 1",212
4349,"Hegesias followed the Cyrenaic principle as far as to this consequence of thought
- HoP 1",89
4350,"That universal is contained in an expression of his which we often enough hear echoed, “There is no perfect happiness
- HoP 1",125
4351,"The body is troubled with manifold pains, and the soul suffers along with it; it is hence a matter of indifference whether we choose life or death
- HoP 1",154
4353,"Poverty and riches have no meaning for what is pleasant, since we see that the rich do not enjoy pleasures more than the poor
- HoP 1",133
4354,"Similarly, slavery and liberty, noble and ignoble birth, fame and lack of fame, are equivalent as regards pleasure
- HoP 1",122
4355,"Only to a fool can living be a matter of moment; to the wise man it is indifferent,” and he is consequently independent
- HoP 1",127
4356,"For even if he attain from others the greatest benefits, this does not equal what he gives himself
- HoP 1",106
4357,"Hegesias and his friends also take away sensation, because it gives no sufficient knowledge,” which really amounts to scepticism
- HoP 1",136
4358,"The sinner should be forgiven, for no one willingly sins, but is conquered by a passion
- HoP 1",95
4360,"It is said of them that “they acknowledged friendship in common life, along with gratitude, honour to parents, and service for one’s country
- HoP 1",148
4361,"And although the wise man has, by so doing, to undergo hardship and work, he can still be happy, even if he therein obtains few pleasures
- HoP 1",145
4363,"This is then the second direction which the Cyrenaic school has taken; the first was the overstepping of the principle itself
- HoP 1",133
4364,"A method of philosophizing in morals arises, which later on prevailed with Cicero and the Peripatetics of his time, but the interest has disappeared, so far as any consistent system of thought is concerned
- HoP 1",213
4365,"There is nothing particular to say of the Cynics, for they possess but little Philosophy, and they did not bring what they had into a scientific system; it was only later that their tenets were raised by the Stoics into a philosophic discipline
- HoP 1",252
4366,"The Cynics also set up the Good as a universal end, and asked in what, for individual men, it is to be sought
- HoP 1",117
4369,"But since this is the same indifference of self-consciousness which Hegesias expressed as real existence, the extremes in the Cynic and Cyrenaic modes of thought destroy themselves by their own consequences, and pass into one another
- HoP 1",241
4371,"The Cynics thus maintained as the content of the good, the greatest independence of nature, ie the slightest possible necessities; this meant a rebound from enjoyment, and from the pleasures of feeling
- HoP 1",209
4372,"The negative is here the determining; later on this opposition of Cynics and Cyrenaics likewise appeared between Stoics and Epicureans
- HoP 1",142
4373,"But the same negation which the Cynics made their principle, had already shown itself in the further development which the Cyrenaic philosophy had taken
- HoP 1",160
4374,"The School of the Cynics had no scientific weight; it only constitutes an element which must necessarily appear in the knowledge of the universal, and which is that consciousness must know itself in its individuality, as free from all dependence on things and on enjoyment
- HoP 1",280
4375,"To him who relies upon riches or enjoyment such dependence is in fact real consciousness, or his individuality is real existence
- HoP 1",136
4376,"But the Cynics so enforced that negative moment that they placed freedom in actual renunciation of so-called superfluities; they only recognized this abstract unmoving independence, which did not concern itself with enjoyment or the interests of an ordinary life
- HoP 1",270
4377,"But true freedom does not consist in flying from enjoyment and the occupations which have as their concern other men and other ends in life; but in the fact that consciousness, though involved in all reality, stands above it and is free from it
- HoP 1",252
4378,"Antisthenes, an Athenian and friend of Socrates, was the first who professed to be a Cynic
- HoP 1",98
4379,"He lived at Athens, and taught in a gymnasium, called Cynosarges, and he was called the “simple dog” (ἁπλοκύων)
- HoP 1",119
4380,"His mother was Thracian, which was often made a reproach to him—a reproach which to us would be unmeaning
- HoP 1",113
4381,"He replied that the mother of the gods was a Phrygian, and that the Athenians, who make so much of their being native born, are in no way nobler than the native fish and grasshoppers
- HoP 1",190
4382,"He educated himself under Gorgias and Socrates, and went daily from the Piræus to the city to hear Socrates
- HoP 1",115
4384,"He gives general rules, which consist of such excellent maxims as that “virtue is self-sufficing, and requires nothing more than a Socratic strength of character
- HoP 1",169
4385,"The good is excellent, the bad discreditable
- HoP 1",52
4386,"Virtue consists of works, and does not require many reasons or theories
- HoP 1",79
4387,"The end of man is a virtuous life
- HoP 1",41
4388,"The wise man is contented with himself, for he possesses everything that others seem to possess
- HoP 1",103
4389,"His own virtue satisfies him; he is at home all over the world
- HoP 1",70
4390,"In this ideal, where the determination of the subject is in question, its satisfaction is placed in simplifying its needs
- HoP 1",129
4391,"But when Antisthenes says that virtue does not require reasons and theories, he forgets that he himself acquired, through the cultivation of mind, its independence and the power of renouncing all that men desire
- HoP 1",219
4392,"The consciousness which has gone beyond itself must, in order to become Mind, now lay hold of and comprehend all reality, ie be conscious of it as its own
- HoP 1",162
4394,"The freedom and independence of the Cynics, however, which consists only in lessening to the utmost the burden imposed by wants, is abstract, because it, as negative in character, has really to be a mere renunciation
- HoP 1",224
4395,"Concrete freedom consists in maintaining an indifferent attitude towards necessities, not avoiding them, but in their satisfaction remaining free, and abiding in morality and in participation in the moral life of man
- HoP 1",224
4396,"Abstract freedom, on the contrary, surrenders its morality, because the individual withdraws into his subjectivity, and is consequently an element of immorality
- HoP 1",168
4397,"Yet Antisthenes bears a high place in this Cynical philosophy
- HoP 1",69
4398,"But the attitude he adopted comes very near to that of rudeness, vulgarity of conduct and shamelessness; and later on Cynicism passed into such
- HoP 1",151
4399,"Hence comes the continual mockery of, and the constant jokes against the Cynics; and it is only their individual manners and individual strength of character which makes them interesting
- HoP 1",194
4400,"It is even told of Antisthenes that he began to attribute value to external poverty of life
- HoP 1",99
4402,"That on which they placed highest value was the simplification of their needs; it seems very plausible to say that this produces freedom
- HoP 1",144
4403,"For needs are certainly dependence upon nature, and this is antagonistic to freedom of spirit; the reduction of that dependence to a minimum is thus an idea which commends itself
- HoP 1",186
4404,"But at the same time this minimum is itself undetermined, and if such stress is laid on thus merely following nature, it follows that too great a value is set on the needs of nature and on the renunciation of others
- HoP 1",223
4405,"This is what is also evident in the monastic principle
- HoP 1",62
4406,"The negative likewise contains an affirmative bias towards what is renounced; and the renunciation and the importance of what is renounced is thus made too marked
- HoP 1",170
4407,"Socrates hence declares the clothing of the Cynics to be vanity
- HoP 1",71
4408,"For “when Antisthenes turned outside a hole in his cloak, Socrates said to him, I see thy vanity through the hole in thy cloak”170 Clothing is not a thing of rational import, but is regulated through needs that arise of themselves
- HoP 1",238
4409,"In the North the clothing must be different from that in Central Africa; and in winter we do not wear cotton garments
- HoP 1",125
4410,"Anything further is meaningless, and is left to chance and to opinion; in modern times, for instance, old-fashioned clothing had a meaning in relation to patriotism
- HoP 1",172
4411,"The cut of my coat is decided by fashion, and the tailor sees to this; it is not my business to invent it, for mercifully others have done so for me
- HoP 1",156
4412,"This dependence on custom and opinion is certainly better than were it to be on nature
- HoP 1",94
4413,"But it is not essential that men should direct their understanding to this; indifference is the point of view which must reign, since the thing itself is undoubtedly perfectly indifferent
- HoP 1",195
4414,"Men are proud that they can distinguish themselves in this, and try to make a fuss about it, but it is folly to set oneself against the fashion
- HoP 1",151
4415,"In this matter I must hence not decide myself, nor may I draw it within the radius of my interests, but simply do what is expected of me
- HoP 1",144
4416,"Diogenes of Sinope, the best known Cynic, distinguished himself even more than Antisthenes by the life he led, as also by his biting and often clever hits, and bitter and sarcastic retorts; but he likewise received replies which were often aimed as well
- HoP 1",261
4417,"He is called the Dog, just as Aristippus was called by him the royal Dog, for Diogenes bore the same relation to idle boys as Aristippus did to kings
- HoP 1",157
4418,"Diogenes is only famed for his manner of life; with him, as with the moderns, Cynicism came to signify more a mode of living than a philosophy
- HoP 1",150
4419,"He confined himself to the barest necessities, and tried to make fun of others who did not think as he, and who laughed at his ways
- HoP 1",139
4420,"That he threw away his cup when he saw a boy drinking out of his hands is well known
- HoP 1",92
4421,"To have no wants, said Diogenes, is divine; to have as few as possible is to come nearest to the divine
- HoP 1",111
4423,"But a mode of life such as that followed by the Cynics, which professed to be a result of culture, is really conditioned by the culture of the mind
- HoP 1",155
4424,"The Cynics were not anchorites; their consciousness was still essentially related to other consciousness
- HoP 1",112
4425,"Antisthenes and Diogenes lived in Athens, and could only exist there
- HoP 1",76
4426,"But in culture the mind is also directed to the most manifold needs, and to the methods of satisfying these
- HoP 1",115
4427,"In more recent times the needs have much increased, and hence a division of the general wants into many particular wants and modes of satisfaction has arisen; this is the function of the activity of the understanding, and in its application luxury has a place
- HoP 1",267
4428,"Thus the chief point is to place no greater value on such matters than what is demanded, or generally, to place no importance either on possessing or dispensing with them
- HoP 1",178
4429,"Of Diogenes we have only anecdotes to relate
- HoP 1",52
4430,"In a voyage to Ægina he fell into the hands of sea-robbers, and was to be sold as a slave in Crete
- HoP 1",106
4431,"There are very many stories told of his residence in Athens
- HoP 1",67
4432,"There he presented a contrast in his rudeness and disdainfulness to Aristippus’ fawning philosophy
- HoP 1",106
4433,"Aristippus set no value on his enjoyments any more than on his wants, but Diogenes did so on his poverty
- HoP 1",112
4435,"When Diogenes stood wet through with rain, and the bystanders pitied him, Plato said, “If you wish to compassionate him, just go away
- HoP 1",141
4437,"Antisthenes and Diogenes, as already mentioned, were men of great culture
- HoP 1",81
4438,"The succeeding Cynics are not any the less conspicuous by their exceeding shamelessness, but they were, generally speaking, nothing more than swinish beggars, who found their satisfaction in the insolence which they showed to others
- HoP 1",240
4439,"They are worthy of no further consideration in Philosophy, and they deserve in its full the name of dogs, which was early given to them; for the dog is a shameless animal
- HoP 1",178
4441,"THE development of philosophic science as science, and, further, the progress from the Socratic point of view to the scientific, begins with Plato and is completed by Aristotle
- HoP 2",184
4442,"They of all others deserve to be called teachers of the human race
- HoP 2",74
4445,"By so doing he rendered it possible to interpret and apply the principle, though his manner of representation may not be altogether scientific
- HoP 2",150
4446,"Plato is one of those world-famed individuals, his philosophy one of those world-renowned creations, whose influence, as regards the culture and development of the mind, has from its commencement down to the present time been all-important
- HoP 2",247
4447,"For what is peculiar in the philosophy of Plato is its application to the intellectual and supersensuous world, and its elevation of consciousness into the realm of spirit
- HoP 2",179
4448,"Thus the spiritual element which belongs to thought obtains in this form an importance for consciousness, and is brought into consciousness; just as, on the other hand, consciousness obtains a foothold on the soil of the other
- HoP 2",234
4450,"We must begin by mentioning the facts of Plato’s life
- HoP 2",61
4451,"Plato was an Athenian, born in the third year of the 87th Olympiad, or, according to Dodwell, Ol
- HoP 2",104
4452,"He was, according to this, thirty-nine or forty years younger than Socrates
- HoP 2",83
4453,"His father, Ariston, traced his lineage from Cadrus; his mother, Perictione, was descended from Solon
- HoP 2",109
4454,"The paternal uncle of his mother was the celebrated Critias, who was for a time among the associates of Socrates, and who was the most talented and brilliant, but also the most dangerous and obnoxious, of the Thirty Tyrants of Athens (supra, Vol

- HoP 2",142
4456,"Sprung from this noble race, and with no lack of means for his culture, Plato received from the most highly esteemed of the Sophists an education in all the arts which were then thought to befit an Athenian
- HoP 2",214
4457,"In his family he was called Aristocles; it was only later that he received from his teacher the name of Plato
- HoP 2",117
4459,"He was brought by his father to Socrates when in his twentieth year, and enjoyed intimate friendship with him for eight years
- HoP 2",133
4460,"It is related that Socrates dreamt on the preceding night that he had a young swan perched on his knees, whose wings quickly developed, and which then flew up to heaven, singing the sweetest songs
- HoP 2",204
4462,"He also studied the Eleatics, and very particularly the Pythagoreans, and he frequented the society of the most noted Sophists
- HoP 2",134
4463,"Thus deeply immersed in Philosophy, he lost his interest in poetry and politics, and gave them up altogether, that he might devote himself entirely to scientific pursuits

4464,"I p 448) that, after Socrates was put to death, Plato, like many other philosophers, fled from Athens, and betook himself to Euclides at Megara
- HoP 2",151
4465,"Leaving Megara before long, he travelled first to Cyrene in Africa, where he turned his attention specially to mathematics, under the guidance of the celebrated mathematician Theodoras, whom he introduces as taking part in several of his dialogues
- HoP 2",255
4466,"Plato himself soon attained to high proficiency in mathematics
- HoP 2",70
4467,"To him is attributed the solution of the Delian or Delphic problem, which was proposed by the oracle, and, like the Pythagorean dogma, has reference to the cube
- HoP 2",168
4468,"The problem is, to draw a line the cube of which will be equal to the sum of two given cubes
- HoP 2",100
4469,"This requires a construction through two curves
- HoP 2",55
4471,"From Cyrene Plato went to Italy and Egypt
- HoP 2",49
4472,"In Magna Græcia he made the acquaintance of the Pythagoreans of that day, Archytas of Tarentum, the celebrated mathematician, Philolaus and others; and he also bought the writings of the older Pythagoreans at a high price
- HoP 2",229
4473,"In Sicily he made friends with Dion
- HoP 2",43
4475,"Plato’s busy life in Athens was twice interrupted by a journey to Sicily, to the Court of Dionysius the younger, ruler of Syracuse and Sicily
- HoP 2",149
4476,"This connection with Dionysius was the most important, if not the only external relation into which Plato entered; it had, however, no lasting result

- HoP 2",214
4485,"The position of affairs represented thereby can be nothing but this, seeing that lack of energy alone allows itself to be guided; but it is also the same lack of energy which renders impossible of execution even a plan made by itself
- HoP 2",241
4486,"The rupture between Plato and Dionysius took place on personal grounds
- HoP 2",78
4487,"Dionysius fell out with his relative Dion, and Plato became involved in the quarrel, because he would not give up his friendship with Dion
- HoP 2",146
4488,"Dionysius was incapable of a friendship based on esteem and sympathy in pursuits; it was partly his personal inclination to Plato, and partly mere vanity, which had made him seek the philosopher’s friendship
- HoP 2",215
4489,"Dionysius could not, however, induce Plato to come under any obligation to him; he desired that Plato should give himself up to him entirely, but this was a demand that Plato refused to entertain5   Plato accordingly took his departure
- HoP 2",243
4490,"After the separation, however, both felt the desire to be again together
- HoP 2",80
4491,"Dionysius recalled Plato, in order to effect a reconciliation with him; he could not endure that he should have failed in the attempt to attach Plato permanently to himself, and he found it specially intolerable that Plato would not give up Dion
- HoP 2",253
4493,"But Dionysius found that he could endure Plato’s presence no better than his absence; he felt himself thereby constrained
- HoP 2",129
4494,"And though, by the influence of Plato and his other companions, a respect for science had been awakened in Dionysius, and he had thus become more cultured, he never penetrated beyond the surface
- HoP 2",202
4495,"His interest in Philosophy was just as superficial as his repeated attempts in poetry; and while he wished to be everything—poet, philosopher, and statesman—he would not submit to be under the guidance of others
- HoP 2",219
4496,"Thus no closer tie between Plato and Dionysius was formed; they drew together again, and again parted, so that the third visit to Sicily ended also in coldness, and the connection was not again established
- HoP 2",213
4498,"The Pythagoreans of Tarentum came at length to the rescue,6 demanded Plato back from Dionysius, got him conveyed away safely, and brought him to Greece
- HoP 2",159
4500,"At a later date, therefore, he actually refused to be the lawgiver of other States, though they had made application to him for that very purpose; amongst these applicants were the inhabitants of Cyrene and the Arcadians
- HoP 2",228
4502,"But theorizing is not sufficient for a constitution; it is not individuals who make it; it is something divine and spiritual, which develops in history
- HoP 2",159
4503,"So strong is this power of the world-spirit that the thought of an individual is as nothing against it; and when such thoughts do count for something, ie when they can be realized, they are then none other than the product of this power of the universal spirit
- HoP 2",268
4504,"The idea that Plato should become lawgiver was not adapted for the times; Solon and Lycurgus were lawgivers, but in Plato’s day such a thing was impracticable
- HoP 2",166
4507,"The form and matter of these works are alike of interest and importance
- HoP 2",79
4508,"In studying them we must nevertheless make sure, in the first place, what of Philosophy we mean to seek and may find within them, and, on the other hand, what Plato’s point of view never can afford us, because in his time it was not there to give
- HoP 2",254
4509,"Thus it may be that the longing with which we approached Philosophy is left quite unsatisfied; it is, however, better that we should not be altogether satisfied than that such conclusions should be regarded as final
- HoP 2",223
4510,"Plato’s point of view is clearly defined and necessary, but it is impossible for us to remain there, or to go back to it; for Reason now makes higher demands
- HoP 2",165
4512,"We must stand above Plato, ie we must acquaint ourselves with the needs of thoughtful minds in our own time, or rather we must ourselves experience these needs
- HoP 2",167
4514,"It would be perfectly justifiable to return to Plato in order to learn anew from him the Idea of speculative Philosophy, but it is idle to speak of him with extravagant enthusiasm, as if he represented beauty and excellence in general
- HoP 2",242
4515,"Moreover, it is quite superfluous for Philosophy, and belongs to the hypercriticism of our times, to treat Plato from a literary point of view, as Schleiermacher does, critically examining whether one or another of the minor dialogues is genuine or not
- HoP 2",260
4516,"Regarding the more important of the dialogues, we may mention that the testimony of the ancients leaves not the slightest doubt
- HoP 2",135
4517,"Then of course the very character of Plato’s works, offering us in their manysidedness various modes of treating Philosophy, constitutes the first difficulty standing in the way of a comprehension of his philosophy
- HoP 2",222
4519,"But, as it happens, we have only Plato’s Dialogues, and their form renders it all the more difficult for us to gather a definite idea of his philosophy
- HoP 2",159
4520,"For the dialogue form contains very heterogeneous elements; Philosophy proper in the treatment of absolute Being, and, intermingled with that, its particular mode of representation
- HoP 2",188
4521,"It is just this which constitutes the manysidedness of Plato’s works
- HoP 2",76
4522,"A second difficulty is said to lie in the distinction drawn between exoteric and esoteric philosophy
- HoP 2",108
4523,"Aristotle, too, had an esoteric and an exoteric philosophy, but with this difference, that in his case the distinction was merely formal, while with Plato it was also material” How nonsensical!
- HoP 2",201
4524,"This would appear as if the philosopher kept possession of his thoughts in the same way as of his external goods: the philosophic Idea is, however, something utterly different, and instead of being possessed by, it possesses a man
- HoP 2",238
4525,"It is easy enough to hand over an external possession, but the communication of ideas requires a certain skill; there is always something esoteric in this, something more than the merely exoteric
- HoP 2",203
4526,"This difficulty is therefore trifling
- HoP 2",45
4529,"Hence it was said that to these philosophies the whole matter of the treatise belonged, the outward form alone being Plato’s
- HoP 2",132
4530,"It is therefore necessary to distinguish what is peculiarly his and what is not, or whether the component parts are in harmony
- HoP 2",134
4531,"In the Socratic Dialogues that we have from Cicero, the personages can be much more readily made out; but in Cicero there is nothing of real interest offered to us
- HoP 2",171
4533,"Here, on the contrary, the divergency of opinions which comes out is examined, and a conclusion arrived at as to the truth; or, if the result is negative, the whole process of knowledge is what is seen in Plato
- HoP 2",218
4534,"There is, therefore, no need to inquire further as to what belongs to Socrates in the Dialogues, and what belongs to Plato
- HoP 2",130
4536,"Philosophy is not a thing apart, like a work of art; though even in a work of art it is the skill which the artist learns from others that he puts into practice
- HoP 2",168
4537,"But Philosophy has one thought, one reality, as its foundation; and nothing can be put in the place of the true knowledge of this already attained; it must of necessity make itself evident in later developments
- HoP 2",218
4538,"Therefore, as I have already observed (Vol
- HoP 2",50
4540,"In giving a general idea of the history of Philosophy, we have already seen (Vol
- HoP 2",88
4541,"I p 54) that such points of union, in which the true is concrete, must occur in the onward course of philosophical development
- HoP 2",134
4542,"The concrete is the unity of diverse determinations and principles; these, in order to be perfected, in order to come definitely before the consciousness, must first of all be presented separately
- HoP 2",204
4543,"Thereby they of course acquire an aspect of one-sidedness in comparison with the higher principle which follows: this, nevertheless, does not annihilate them, nor even leave them where they were, but takes them up into itself as moments
- HoP 2",244
4544,"Thus in Plato’s philosophy we see all manner of philosophic teaching from earlier times absorbed into a deeper principle, and therein united
- HoP 2",148
4545,"It is in this way that Plato’s philosophy shows itself to be a totality of ideas: therefore, as the result, the principles of others are comprehended in itself
- HoP 2",167
4546,"Frequently Plato does nothing more than explain the doctrines of earlier philosophers; and the only particular feature in his representation of them is that their scope is extended
- HoP 2",188
4547,"His Timæus is, by unanimous testimony, the amplification of a still extant work of Pythagoras;14 and, in like manner, his amplification of the doctrine of Parmenides is of such a nature that its principle is freed from its one-sided character
- HoP 2",250
4548,"These last two difficulties having been disposed of, if we would likewise solve the first mentioned, we must proceed to describe the form in which Plato has propounded his ideas, keeping it, on the other hand, distinct from Philosophy proper, as we find it with him
- HoP 2",273
4549,"The form of the Platonic philosophy is, as is well known, the dialogue
- HoP 2",78
4550,"The beauty of this form is highly attractive; yet we must not think, as many do, that it is the most perfect form in which to present Philosophy; it is peculiar to Plato, and as a work of art is of course to be much esteemed
- HoP 2",232
4551,"In the first place, scenery and dramatic form belong to what is external
- HoP 2",80
4552,"Plato gives to his Dialogues a setting of reality, both as regards place and persons, and chooses out some particular occasion which has brought his characters together; this in itself is very natural and charming
- HoP 2",221
4553,"Socrates takes the leading part, and among the other actors there are many stars well known to us, such as Agathon, Zeno, and Aristophanes
- HoP 2",146
4554,"We find ourselves in some particular spot; in the Phædrus (p 229 Steph
- HoP 2",78
4555,"By never allowing himself to appear in person, but putting his thoughts always in the mouth of others, any semblance of preaching or of dogmatizing is avoided by Plato, and the narrator appears just as little as he does in the History of Thucydides or in Homer
- HoP 2",268
4556,"Xenophon sometimes brings himself forward, sometimes he entirely loses sight of the aim he had in view, of vindicating by what he tells of them the life of Socrates and his method of instruction
- HoP 2",202
4557,"With Plato, on the contrary, all is quite objective and plastic; and he employs great art in removing from himself all responsibility for his assertions, often assigning them even to a third or fourth person
- HoP 2",215
4558,"As regards the tone of the intercourse between the characters in these Dialogues, we find that the noblest urbanity of well-bred men reigns supreme; the Dialogues are a lesson in refinement; we see in them the savoir faire of a man acquainted with the world
- HoP 2",265
4559,"The term courtesy does not quite express urbanity; it is too wide, and includes the additional notion of testifying respect, of expressing deference and personal obligation; urbanity is true courtesy, and forms its real basis
- HoP 2",233
4560,"But urbanity makes a point of granting complete liberty to all with whom we converse, both as regards the character and matter of their opinions, and also the right of giving expression to the same
- HoP 2",205
4562,"However energetically we may then express ourselves, we must always acknowledge that our opponent is also a thinking person; just as one must not take to speaking with the air of being an oracle, nor prevent anyone else from opening his mouth in reply
- HoP 2",259
4563,"This urbanity is, however, not forbearance, but rather the highest degree of frankness and candour, and it is this very characteristic which gives such gracefulness to Plato’s Dialogues
- HoP 2",193
4564,"Finally, this dialogue is not a conversation, in which what is said has, and is meant to have, a merely casual connection, without any exhaustive treatment of the subject
- HoP 2",178
4566,"Later, however, these dialogues become a systematic development of the matter in hand, wherein the subjective character of the conversation disappears, and the whole course of the argument shows a beautifully consistent dialectic process
- HoP 2",245
4567,"Socrates talks, turns the conversation, lays down his own views, draws a conclusion, and does all this through the apparent instrumentality of the question; most questions are so framed as to be answered by merely Yes or No
- HoP 2",231
4568,"The dialogue seems to be the form best adapted for representing an argument, because it sways hither and thither; the different sides are allotted to different persons, and thus the argument is made more animated
- HoP 2",220
4569,"The dialogue has, however, this disadvantage, that it seems to be carried on arbitrarily, so that at the end the feeling always remains that the matter might have turned out differently
- HoP 2",193
4570,"But in the Platonic Dialogues this arbitrary character is apparent only; it has been got rid of by limiting the development to the development of the subject in hand, and by leaving very little to be said by the second speaker
- HoP 2",234
4571,"Such personages are, as we already saw in connection with Socrates (Vol
- HoP 2",79
4572,"I p 402), plastic personages as regards the conversation; no one is put there to state his own views, or, as the French express it, pour placer son mot
- HoP 2",159
4573,"Just as in the Catechism the answers are prescribed to the questions asked, so is it in these dialogues, for they who answer have to say what the author pleases
- HoP 2",168
4574,"The question is so framed that a quite simple answer is alone possible, and, thanks to the artistic beauty and power of the dialogues, such an answer appears at the same time perfectly natural
- HoP 2",200
4576,"A systematic exposition of Philosophy we cannot in this way find; and of course it is all the less easy for us to take a comprehensive view of the subject, since there are at hand no means of judging whether the treatment has been exhaustive or not
- HoP 2",256
4577,"Nevertheless, there is present there one spirit, one definite point of view as regards Philosophy, even though Mind does not make its appearance in the precise form which we demand
- HoP 2",188
4578,"The philosophic culture of Plato, like the general culture of his time, was not yet ripe for really scientific work; the Idea was still too fresh and new; it was only in Aristotle that it attained to a systematic scientific form of representation
- HoP 2",254
4581,"Here it therefore happens sometimes that the ordinary conception of reality again separates itself from its Notion, and that the latter comes into opposition with it, without any statement having been made that the Notion alone constitutes reality
- HoP 2",255
4585,"Looking at this as it bears on the question of how Plato’s philosophy is to be apprehended, we find, owing to these two circumstances, that either too much or too little is found in it
- HoP 2",192
4586,"Too much is found by the ancients, the so-called -, who sometimes dealt with Plato’s philosophy as they dealt with the Greek mythology
- HoP 2",142
4588,"Sometimes, again, they took what with Plato is in the form of the Notion for the expression of Absolute Being—the theory of Being in the Parmenides, for instance, for the knowledge of God—just as if Plato had not himself drawn a distinction between them
- HoP 2",261
4589,"But in the pure Notions of Plato the ordinary conception as such is not abrogated; either it is not said that these Notions constitute its reality, or they are to Plato no more than a conception, and not reality
- HoP 2",219
4590,"Again, we certainly see that too little is found in Plato by the moderns in particular; for they attach themselves pre-eminently to the side of the ordinary conception, and see in it reality
- HoP 2",198
4591,"Thus we find in Tennemann (Vol
- HoP 2",38
4593,"Many propositions, it is true, are made more easily intelligible by being presented in mythical form; nevertheless, what is not the true way of presenting them; propositions are thoughts which, in order to be pure, must be brought forward as such
- HoP 2",254
4595,"The myth belongs to the pedagogic stage of the human race, since it entices and allures men to occupy themselves with the content; but as it takes away from the purity of thought through sensuous forms, it cannot express the meaning of Thought
- HoP 2",251
4596,"When the Notion attains its full development, it has no more need of the myth
- HoP 2",85
4597,"Plato often says that it is difficult to express one’s thoughts on such and such a subject, and he therefore will employ a myth; no doubt this is easier
- HoP 2",160
4598,"Plato also says of simple Notions that they are dependent, transitory moments, which have their ultimate truth in God; and in this first mention of God by Plato, He is made a mere conception
- HoP 2",198
4599,"Thus the manner of conception and the genuinely speculative element are confounded
- HoP 2",90
4602,"Thus, for instance, in the Timæus (p 41 Steph
- HoP 2",53
4603,"Plato makes use of the form, God created the world, and the dæmons had a certain share in the work; this is spoken quite after the manner of the popular conception
- HoP 2",171
4606,"In short, all that is expressed in the manner of pictorial conception is taken by the moderns in sober earnest for philosophy
- HoP 2",133
4607,"Such a representation of Plato’s philosophy can be supported by Plato’s own words; but one who knows what Philosophy is, cares little for such expressions, and recognizes what was Plato’s true meaning
- HoP 2",208
4608,"In the account of the Platonic philosophy to which I must now proceed, the two cannot certainly be separated, but they must be noted and judged of in a very different manner from that which has prevailed amongst the moderns
- HoP 2",231
4609,"In considering his general conception of Philosophy, the first point that strikes us is the high estimation in which Plato held Philosophy
- HoP 2",146
4610,"The lofty nature of the knowledge of Philosophy deeply impressed him, and he shows a real enthusiasm for the thought which deals with the absolute
- HoP 2",154
4611,"Just as the Cyrenaics treat of the relation of the existent to the individual consciousness, and the Cynics assert immediate freedom to be reality, Plato upholds the self-mediating unity of consciousness and reality, or knowledge
- HoP 2",237
4613,"There is in him none of the so-called modest attitude of this science towards other spheres of knowledge, nor of man towards God
- HoP 2",136
4614,"Plato has a full consciousness of how near human reason is to God, and indeed of its unity with Him
- HoP 2",107
4615,"Men do not mind reading this in Plato, an ancient, because it is no longer a present thing, but were it coming from a modern philosopher, it would be taken much amiss
- HoP 2",174
4616,"Philosophy to Plato is man’s highest possible possession and true reality; it alone has to be sought of man
- HoP 2",115
4617,"Out of many passages on this subject I shall quote in the first instance the following from the Timæus (p 47 Steph
- HoP 2",122
4618,"The distinction between the visible day and the night, the months and courses of the planets, have begotten a knowledge of time, and awakened a desire to know the nature of the whole
- HoP 2",190
4620,"For before this, though a certain value might indeed be attributed to Philosophy, it still remained confined to the thoughts of the individual; here, however, it goes forth into questions of constitution, government, actuality
- HoP 2",234
4621,"After Plato made Socrates, in the Republic, expound the nature of a true state, he caused Glaucon to interrupt by expressing his desire that Plato should show how it could be possible for such a state to exist
- HoP 2",217
4623,"Finally, when pressed, he says: “Then it shall be expressed, even though a flood of laughter and utter disbelief overwhelm me
- HoP 2",133
4625,"As to this demand, it may seem a piece of great presumption to say that philosophers should have the government of states accorded to them, for the territory or ground of history is different from that of Philosophy
- HoP 2",223
4626,"In history, the Idea, as the absolute power, has certainly to realize itself; in other words, God rules in the world
- HoP 2",124
4627,"But history is the Idea working itself out in a natural way, and not with the consciousness of the Idea
- HoP 2",111
4628,"The action is certainly in accordance with general reflections on what is right, moral, and pleasing to God; but we must recognize that action represents at the same time the endeavours of the subject as such for particular ends
- HoP 2",236
4629,"The realization of the Idea thus takes place through an intermingling of thoughts and Notions with immediate and particular ends
- HoP 2",136
4630,"Hence it is only on the one side produced through thoughts, and on the other through circumstances, through human actions in their capacity of means
- HoP 2",156
4631,"These means often seem opposed to the Idea, but that does not really matter; all those particular ends are really only means of bringing forth the Idea, because it is the absolute power
- HoP 2",193
4632,"Hence the Idea comes to pass in the world, and no difficulty is caused, but it is not requisite that those who rule should have the Idea
- HoP 2",144
4633,"In order, however, to judge of the statement that the regents of the people should be philosophers, we must certainty consider what was understood by Philosophy in the Platonic sense and in the sense of the times
- HoP 2",220
4634,"The word Philosophy has had in different periods very different significations
- HoP 2",86
4635,"There was a time when a man who did not believe in spectres or in the devil was called a philosopher
- HoP 2",108
4636,"When such ideas as these pass away, it does not occur to people to call anyone a philosopher for a reason such as this
- HoP 2",126
4637,"The English consider what we call experimental physics to be Philosophy; a philosopher to them is anyone who makes investigations in, and possesses a theoretic knowledge of chemistry, mechanics, &c (Vol
- HoP 2",210
4638,"In Plato Philosophy becomes mingled with the knowledge of the supersensuous, or what to us is religious knowledge
- HoP 2",121
4639,"The Platonic philosophy is thus the knowledge of the absolutely true and right, the knowledge of universal ends in the state, and the recognition of their validity
- HoP 2",171
4641,"This has been from that time forth the business of culture
- HoP 2",66
4642,"A state, a government and constitution of modern times has hence quite a different basis from a state of ancient times, and particularly from one of Plato’s day
- HoP 2",168
4643,"The Greeks were then altogether dissatisfied with their democratic constitution, and the conditions resulting from it (supra, p 8), and similarly all philosophers condemned the democracies of the Greek states in which such things as the punishment of generals (supra, Vol
- HoP 2",279
4644,"I p 391) took place
- HoP 2",27
4646,"This condition of matters preceded the disintegration of the constitution
- HoP 2",81
4647,"In our states, on the other hand, the end of the state, what is best for all, is immanent and efficacious in quite another way than was the case in olden times
- HoP 2",167
4648,"The condition of the laws and courts of justice, of the constitution and spirit of the people, is so firmly established in itself that matters of the passing moment alone remain to be decided; and it may even be asked what, if anything, is dependent on the individual
- HoP 2",275
4650,"The result of this thus is that when Plato says that philosophers should rule, he signifies the determination of the whole matter through universal principles
- HoP 2",166
4651,"This is realized much more in modern states, because universal principles really form the bases—certainly not of all, but of most of them
- HoP 2",145
4652,"Some have already reached this stage, others are striving to reach it, but all recognize that such principles must constitute the real substance of administration and rule
- HoP 2",179
4653,"What Plato demands is thus, in point of fact, already present
- HoP 2",69
4654,"But what we call Philosophy, movement in pure thoughts, has to do with form, and this is something peculiar to itself; nevertheless, the form is not responsible if the universal, freedom, law, is not made a principle in a state
- HoP 2",235
4655,"Marcus Aurelius is an example of what a philosopher upon a throne could effect; we have, however, only private actions to record of him, and the Roman Empire was made no better by him
- HoP 2",191
4656,"He occupied himself with the Wolffian metaphysics and French philosophy and verses, and was thus, according to his times, a philosopher
- HoP 2",143
4657,"Philosophy appears to have been an affair of his own particular inclination, and quite distinct from the fact that he was king
- HoP 2",134
4659,"If, however, later on, procedure of this kind became ordinary custom, the succeeding princes are no longer called philosophers, even if the same principle is present to them, and the government, and especially the institutions, are founded on it
- HoP 2",253
4660,"In the Republic, Plato further speaks in a figure of the difference between a condition of philosophic culture and a lack of Philosophy: it is a long comparison which is both striking and brilliant
- HoP 2",205
4661,"The idea which he makes use of is as follows:—“Let us think of an underground den like a cave with a long entrance opening to the light
- HoP 2",143
4662,"Its inhabitants are chained so that they cannot move their necks, and can see only the back of the cave
- HoP 2",111
4663,"Far behind their backs a torch burns above them
- HoP 2",55
4665,"Those who are chained would see only the shadows which fall on the opposite wall, and they would take them for reality; they would hear, moreover, by means of the echo, what was said by those who moved the figures, and they would think that it was the voice of the shadows
- HoP 2",280
4666,"Now if one of the prisoners were released, and compelled to turn his neck so as to see things as they are, he would think that what he saw was an illusive dream, and that the shadows were the reality
- HoP 2",207
4668,"Since we now speak more fully of this matter, we must in the second place consider the nature of knowledge according to Plato, and in so doing commence our account of the Platonic philosophy itself
- HoP 2",205
4669,"The Idea is nothing else than that which is known to us more familiarly by the name of the Universal, regarded, however, not as the formal Universal, which is only a property of things, but as implicitly and explicitly existent, as reality, as that which alone is true
- HoP 2",276
4670,"Of course when we understand by species nothing but the gathering together by our reflection, and for convenience sake, of the like characteristics of several individuals as indicating their distinguishing features, we have the universal in quite an external form
- HoP 2",271
4671,"But the specific character of the animal is its being alive; this being alive is that which makes it what it is, and deprived of this, it ceases to exist
- HoP 2",161
4672,"To Plato, accordingly, Philosophy is really the science of this implicitly universal, to which, as contrasted with the particular, he always continues to return
- HoP 2",168
4673,"Through the presentation of his Ideas, Plato opened up the intellectual world, which, however, is not beyond reality, in heaven, in another place, but is the real world
- HoP 2",176
4674,"With Leucippus, too, the Ideal is brought closer to reality, and not—metaphysically—thrust away behind Nature
- HoP 2",117
4676,"The differences are not essential, but only transitory; yet the Absolute of Plato, as being the one in itself and identical with itself, is at the same time concrete in itself, in that it is a movement returning into itself, and is eternally at home with itself
- HoP 2",269
4677,"But love for Ideas is that which Plato calls enthusiasm
- HoP 2",63
4678,"The misapprehension of Plato’s Ideas takes two directions; one of these has to do with the thinking, which is formal, and holds as true reality the sensuous alone, or what is conceived of through the senses—this is what Plato asserts to be mere shadows
- HoP 2",260
4682,"As in the former view the Beyond is a conception that lies outside the world, and in which species are hypostatized, so in this view our reason is just such a realm beyond reality
- HoP 2",187
4683,"But when species are looked on as if they were the forms of reality in us, there is again a misapprehension, just as if they were looked at as æsthetic in nature
- HoP 2",169
4684,"By so doing, they are defined as intellectual perceptions which must present themselves immediately, and belong either to a happy genius or else to a condition of ecstasy or enthusiasm
- HoP 2",192
4685,"In such a case they would be mere creations of the imagination, but this is not Plato’s nor the true sense
- HoP 2",114
4688,"On this account Plato first of all distinguishes Science, the Knowledge of the True, from opinion
- HoP 2",105
4689,"Knowledge proceeds from that which is; opinion is opposed to it; but it is not the case that its content is Nothing—that would be ignorance—for when an opinion is held, it is held about Something
- HoP 2",203
4690,"Opinion is thus intermediate between ignorance and science, its content is a mixture of Being and Nothing
- HoP 2",113
4691,"The object of the senses, the object of opinion, the particular, only participates in the Beautiful, the Good, the Just, the Universal; but it is at the same time also ugly, evil, unjust, and so on
- HoP 2",205
4692,"The double is at the same time the half
- HoP 2",47
4693,"The particular is not only large or small, light or heavy, and any one of these opposites, but every particular is as much the one as the other
- HoP 2",151
4694,"Such a mixture of Being and non-Being is the particular, the object of opinion;”19—a mixture in which the opposites have not resolved themselves into the Universal
- HoP 2",171
4695,"The latter would be the speculative Idea of knowledge, while to opinion belongs the manner of our ordinary consciousness
- HoP 2",128
4697,"The source through which we become conscious of the divine is the same as that already seen in Socrates (Vol
- HoP 2",116
4698,"The spirit of man contains reality in itself, and in order to learn what is divine he must develop it out of himself and bring it to consciousness
- HoP 2",154
4699,"But Plato goes on to say that the process by which we come to know is not, properly speaking, learning, for that which we appear to learn we really only recollect
- HoP 2",170
4700,"Plato often comes back to this subject, but in particular he treats of the point in the Meno, in which he asserts (p 81, 84 Steph
- HoP 2",137
4701,"Plato here gives the question a speculative significance, in which the reality of knowledge, and not the empirical view of the acquisition of knowledge, is dealt with
- HoP 2",174
4702,"For learning, according to the immediate ordinary conception of it, expresses the taking up of what is foreign into thinking consciousness, a mechanical mode of union and the filling of an empty space with things which are foreign and indifferent to this space itself
- HoP 2",275
4704,"But Plato presents the true nature of consciousness in asserting that it is mind in which, as mind, that is already present which becomes object to consciousness, or which it explicitly becomes
- HoP 2",201
4705,"This is the Notion of the true universal in its movement; of the species which is in itself its own Becoming, in that it is already implicitly what it explicitly becomes—a process in which it does not come outside of itself
- HoP 2",231
4706,"Mind is this absolute species, whose process is only the continual return into itself; thus nothing is for it which it is not in itself
- HoP 2",143
4707,"According to this, the process of learning is not that something foreign enters in, but that the mind’s own essence becomes actualized, or it comes to the knowledge of this last
- HoP 2",185
4708,"What has not yet learned is the soul, the consciousness represented as natural being
- HoP 2",92
4710,"In that it abrogates this semblance of other-being, it comprehends the objective, ie gives itself immediately in it the consciousness of itself, and thus attains to science
- HoP 2",180
4711,"Ideas of individual, temporal, transitory things undoubtedly come from without, but not the universal thoughts which, as the true, have their root in the mind and belong to its nature; by this means all authority is destroyed
- HoP 2",233
4712,"In one sense recollection Erinnerung is certainly an unfortunate expression, in the sense, namely, that an idea is reproduced which has already existed at another time
- HoP 2",175
4713,"But recollection has another sense, which is given by its etymology, namely that of making oneself inward, going inward, and this is the profound meaning of the word in thought
- HoP 2",184
4715,"With Plato, however, as we cannot deny, the word recollection has constantly the first and empirical sense
- HoP 2",114
4716,"This comes from the fact that Plato propounds the true Notion that consciousness in itself is the content of knowledge, partly in the form of popular idea and in that of myths
- HoP 2",183
4717,"Hence here even, the already mentioned (p 18) intermingling of idea and Notion commences
- HoP 2",96
4718,"In the Meno (p 82-86 Steph
- HoP 2",34
4719,"Socrates tries to show, by experiment on a slave who had received no instruction, that learning is a recollection
- HoP 2",121
4720,"Socrates merely questions him, leaving him to answer in his own way, without either teaching him or asserting the truth of any fact, and at length brings him to the enunciation of a geometrical proposition on the relation which the diagonal of a square bears to its side
- HoP 2",278
4721,"The slave obtains the knowledge out of himself alone, so that it appears as though he only recollected what he already knew but had forgotten
- HoP 2",149
4723,"But this moment of individuality belongs only to the ordinary conception, and recollection is not thought; for recollection relates to man as a sensuous “this,” and not as a universal
- HoP 2",191
4724,"The essential nature of the coming forth of knowledge is hence here mingled with the individual, with ordinary conception, and knowledge here appears in the form of soul, as of the implicitly existent reality, the one, for the soul is still only a moment of spirit
- HoP 2",272
4725,"As Plato here passes into a conception the content of which has no longer the pure significance of the universal, but of the individual, he further depicts it in the form of a myth
- HoP 2",188
4726,"He represents the implicit existence of mind in the form of a pre-existence in time, as if the truth had already been for us in another time
- HoP 2",148
4727,"But at the same time we must remark that he does not propound this as a philosophic doctrine, but in the form of a saying received from priests and priestesses who comprehend what is divine
- HoP 2",197
4728,"Pindar and other holy men say the same
- HoP 2",46
4729,"According to these sayings, the human soul is immortal; it both ceases to be, or, as men say, it dies, and it comes again into existence, but in no way perishes
- HoP 2",168
4730,"But Plato made no such statement whatever; what he here says has nothing to do with Philosophy, and more particularly nothing to do with his philosophy, any more than what afterwards is said regarding God
- HoP 2",212
4731,"In other Dialogues this myth is further and more strikingly developed; it certainly employs remembrance in its ordinary sense, which is that the mind of man has in past time seen that which comes to his consciousness as the true and absolutely existent
- HoP 2",260
4733,"In the Phædrus (p 245 Steph
- HoP 2",35
4734,"Plato speaks of this in order to show that the Eros is a divine madness (μανία), and is given to us as the greatest happiness
- HoP 2",133
4735,"It is a state of enthusiasm, which here has a powerful, predominating aspiration towards the Idea (supra, p 30): but it is not an enthusiasm proceeding from the heart and feeling, it is not an ordinary perception, but a consciousness and knowledge of the ideal
- HoP 2",268
4736,"Plato says that he must expound the nature of the divine and human soul in order to demonstrate the Eros
- HoP 2",112
4737,"For what moves itself is immortal and eternal, but what obtains its movement from another is transient
- HoP 2",110
4738,"What moves itself is the first principle, for it certainly has its origin and first beginning in itself and derived from no other
- HoP 2",137
4739,"Now thought is one of these qualities, which are thus independent of the thing; and thought is also here defined as a thing, and as if it could pass away or cease to be
- HoP 2",176
4740,"It is as with body, where the weight is not a quality, but its substance; for as the body would no longer exist if the weight were abstracted, the soul would not exist if thought were taken away
- HoP 2",202
4741,"Thought is the activity of the universal, not an abstraction, but the reflection into self and the positing of self that takes place in all conceptions
- HoP 2",159
4742,"Now because thought is an eternal which remains at home with itself in every change, soul preserves its identity in what is different, just as, for instance, in sensuous perception it deals with what is different, with outside matter, and is yet at home with itself
- HoP 2",273
4744,"To Plato the immortality of the soul is hence likewise of great importance
- HoP 2",82
4746,"He says: “The soul resembles the united power of a chariot and charioteer” This image expresses nothing to us
- HoP 2",117
4747,"As might be expected, the driving is very difficult
- HoP 2",59
4748,"How mortal differ from immortal creatures, we must endeavour to discover

- HoP 2",124
4750,"When perfect and fully winged, she soars upwards” (has elevated thoughts), “and is the ruler of the universe
- HoP 2",116
4752,"This transition from thought to body is very difficult, too difficult for the ancients to understand; we shall find more about it in Aristotle
- HoP 2",150
4754,"The fact that the spiritual realizes itself from itself is a point not sufficiently examined by the ancients; they take two abstractions, soul and matter, and the connection is expressed only in the form of a deterioration on the part of soul
- HoP 2",250
4756,"It signifies the identity of subjectivity and objectivity, the inseparability of the ideal and real, that is, of soul and body
- HoP 2",134
4757,"The mortal and finite is, on the contrary, correctly defined by Plato as that of which the existence is not absolutely adequate to the Idea, or, more definitely, to subjectivity
- HoP 2",185
4758,"Plato now further explains what happens in the life of the divine Being, which drama the soul thus has before it, and how the wasting of its wings occurs
- HoP 2",161
4759,"An array of other gods and goddesses follow him, marshalled in eleven bands
- HoP 2",83
4760,"They present—each one fulfilling his work—the noblest and most blessed of scenes
- HoP 2",88
4761,"The colourless and formless and intangible essence requires thought, the lord of the soul, as its only spectator, and thus true knowledge takes its rise
- HoP 2",160
4762,"For there it sees what is (τὸ ὄν), and lives in the contemplation of reality, because it follows in an ever-recurring revolution” (of ideas)
- HoP 2",148
4763,"This is the life of the gods
- HoP 2",36
4765,"In this condition it retains a recollection of what it has seen, and if it perceives anything beautiful or right, it is rapt in amazement
- HoP 2",145
4767,"This constitutes the general principle of the Platonic conception
- HoP 2",73
4769,"It cannot be said of Plato that he had any such belief, and he never speaks of the matter in the sense that theologians did; in the same way he never spoke about a Fall from a perfect state, for example, as if man had to look on the present life as an imprisonment
- HoP 2",272
4770,"But what Plato expressed as the truth is that consciousness in the individual is in reason the divine reality and life; that man perceives and recognizes it in pure thought, and that this knowledge is itself the heavenly abode and movement
- HoP 2",247
4771,"Knowledge in the form of soul, is more clearly dealt with in the Phædo, where Plato has further developed the ideas about the immortality of the soul
- HoP 2",157
4772,"That Plato should have connected this discussion with the account of the death of Socrates has in all time been matter of admiration
- HoP 2",140
4774,"It must first be really appropriate for the dying person to occupy himself with himself instead of with the universal, with this certainty of himself as a “this” instead of with the Truth
- HoP 2",195
4777,"A principal point in this argument is that already considered, that the soul has existed before this life, because learning is only a recollection,25 and this implies that the soul is already implicitly what it becomes
- HoP 2",226
4778,"But Plato mainly founds the idea of immortality on the fact that what is put together is liable to dissolution and decay, while the simple can in no manner be dissolved or destroyed; what is always like itself and the same, is, however, simple
- HoP 2",251
4779,"The beautiful, the good, the like, being simple, are incapable of all change; that, on the contrary, in which these universals are, men, things, &c, are the changeable

4780,"They are perceptible by the senses, while the former is the supersensuous
- HoP 2",81
4783,"On the other hand Plato makes Socrates show that the soul is not a harmony in this sense, for the sensuous harmony first exists after its elements, and is a consequence that follows from them
- HoP 2",199
4784,"The harmony of the soul is, however, in and for itself, before every sensuous thing
- HoP 2",91
4786,"Although later on we come across the myth of the sojourn of the soul after death in another and more brilliant earth,28 we have seen above (pp

4787,"The development and culture of the soul must be taken in connection with what precedes
- HoP 2",94
4789,"It is often said that idealism means that the individual produces from himself all his ideas, even the most immediate
- HoP 2",125
4790,"But this is an unhistoric, and quite false conception; if we take this rude definition of idealism, there have been no idealists amongst the philosophers, and Platonic idealism is certainly far removed from anything of the kind

4791,"In the seventh book of his Republic (p 518 Steph, pp

- HoP 2",68
4793,"Carried to an extreme, this is the doctrine of revelation in which everything is given from without
- HoP 2",107
4795,"Plato speaks against any such idea, for, in relation to the merely popularly expressed myth given above, he says: “Reason teaches that every man possesses the inherent capacities of the soul and the organ with which he learns
- HoP 2",233
4797,"But we say that this Being is the good
- HoP 2",46
4799,"The other virtues of the soul are more in conformity with the body; they are not originally in the soul, but come gradually through exercise and habit
- HoP 2",158
4800,"Thought (τὸ φρονῆσαι) on the contrary, as divine, never loses its power, and only becomes good or evil through the manner of this conversion” This is what Plato establishes in regard to the inward and the outward
- HoP 2",220
4801,"Such ideas as that mind determines the good from out of itself are to us much more familiar than to Plato; but it was by Plato that they were first maintained
- HoP 2",166
4802,"Plato is entirely opposed to the idea that the truth is given through sensuous consciousness, which is what is known and that from which we start; for this is the doctrine of the Sophists with which we met in dealing with Protagoras, for instance
- HoP 2",254
4803,"As regards feeling, we easily make the mistake of placing everything in feeling, as indeed that Platonic rage for beauty contained the truth in the guise of feeling; but this is not the true form of the truth, because feeling is the entirely subjective consciousness
- HoP 2",274
4804,"Feeling as such is merely a form with which men make the arbitrary will the principle of the truth, for what is the true content is not given through feeling; in it every content has a place
- HoP 2",198
4806,"The mistake, however, is to say that a content is true because it is in our feeling
- HoP 2",91
4807,"Hence the importance of Plato’s doctrine that the content becomes filled by thought alone; for it is the universal which can be grasped by the activity of thought alone
- HoP 2",176
4808,"Plato has defined this universal content as Idea

4809,"At the close of the sixth book of the Republic (pp

4827,"The Critias should be taken in connection with the Timæus and the Republic, but we need not make further reference to it, for it is only a fragment
- HoP 2",155
4828,"Plato makes these three dialogues one connected conversation
- HoP 2",68
4830,"Of this, however, only the beginning has come down to us29 Hence if the Parmenides be taken along with the Republic and the Timæus, the three together constitute the whole Platonic system of philosophy divided into its three parts or sections
- HoP 2",250
4831,"We now wish to consider the philosophy of Plato more in detail in accordance with these three different points of view
- HoP 2",126
4832,"We certainly do not find in Plato a full consciousness that this is the nature of dialectic, but we find dialectic itself present; that is, we find absolute existence thus recognized in pure Notions, and the representation of the movement of these Notions
- HoP 2",263
4834,"But in that very way the Notions attain greater truth
- HoP 2",61
4835,"For otherwise pure logical movement might easily appear to us to exist on its own account, like a private territory, which has another region alongside of it, also having its own particular place
- HoP 2",203
4836,"But since both are there brought together, the speculative element begins to appear as it is in truth; that is, as being the only truth, and that, indeed, through the transformation of sensuous opinion into thought
- HoP 2",222
4837,"For in our consciousness we first of all find the immediate individual, the sensuous real; or there are also categories of the understanding which are held by us to be ultimate and true
- HoP 2",193
4838,"But contrasted with merely external reality, it is rather the ideal that is the most real, and it was Plato who perceived that it was the only real, for he characterized the universal or thought as the true, in opposition to what is sensuous
- HoP 2",249
4839,"Thus the aim of many of Plato’s Dialogues, which conclude without any positive affirmation (Vol
- HoP 2",103

4841,"We have been before reminded (Vol

4843,"But if this dialectic is laid hold of, the particular passes away and becomes another than that which it is taken to be
- HoP 2",127
4844,"Formal philosophy cannot look at dialectic in any other way than as being the art of confusing ordinary conceptions or even Notions, and demonstrating their nullity, thus making their result to be merely negative
- HoP 2",220
4845,"We find this dialectic a great deal in Plato, both in the more Socratic and moralizing dialogues, and in the many dialogues which relate to the conceptions of the Sophists in regard to science
- HoP 2",200
4846,"In connection with this, the second part of dialectic makes its first aim the bringing of the universal in men to consciousness, which, as we formerly remarked when speaking of Socrates (Vol
- HoP 2",198
4847,"I p 398), was the main interest of Socratic culture
- HoP 2",59
4848,"From this time on, we may look at such an aim as having been discarded, and simply remark that a number of Plato’s Dialogues merely aim at bringing to consciousness a general conception, such as we have without taking any trouble at all (Vol
- HoP 2",249
4849,"This dialectic is, indeed, also a movement of thought, but it is really only necessary in an external way and for reflecting consciousness, in order to allow the universal, what is in and for itself, unalterable and immortal, to come forth

4851,"A subject which Plato very often treats of with this end in view, is virtue, which he proves to be only one (Vol
- HoP 2",120
4853,"This determination is the relation which the dialectic movement in thought bears to the universal, for through this movement the Idea comes to these thoughts which contain the opposites of the finite within themselves
- HoP 2",225
4854,"For the Idea, as the self-determining, is the unity of these differences, and thus the determinate Idea
- HoP 2",111
4855,"The universal is hence determined as that which resolves and has resolved the contradictions in itself, and hence it is the concrete in itself; thus this sublation of contradiction is the affirmative
- HoP 2",207
4856,"Dialectic in this higher sense is the really Platonic; as speculative it does not conclude with a negative result, for it demonstrates the union of opposites which have annulled themselves
- HoP 2",196
4857,"Here begins what is difficult for the understanding to grasp
- HoP 2",68
4858,"The form of Plato’s methods being not yet, however, developed purely on its own account, this is the reason that his dialectic is still often merely reasoning, and that it proceeds from individual points of view and frequently remains without result
- HoP 2",257
4859,"On the other hand, Plato’s own teaching is directed against this merely reasoning dialectic; yet we see that it gives him trouble properly to show forth the difference
- HoP 2",175
4860,"The speculative dialectic which commences with him, is thus the most interesting but also the most difficult part of his work; hence acquaintance is not usually made with it when the Platonic writings are studied
- HoP 2",220
4861,"Tennemann, for example, did not at all comprehend what was most important in the Platonic philosophy, and only gathered some of it together in the form of dry ontological determinations—for that was what he could comprehend
- HoP 2",231
4862,"But it shows the greatest lack of intellect in a historian of Philosophy only to see in a great philosophic form whether there is anything yielding profit to himself or not
- HoP 2",180
4863,"What we have thus to deal with in the dialectic of Plato is the pure thought of reason, from which he very clearly distinguishes the understanding (διάνοια), (supra, p 47)
- HoP 2",179
4864,"We may have thoughts about many things—if indeed, we do have thought at all—but this is not what Plato means
- HoP 2",116
4866,"This fuller determination may, from what has gone before, be understood thus: Plato first comprehended the Absolute as the Being of Parmenides, but as the Universal which, as species, is also end, ie which rules, penetrates, and produces the particular and manifold
- HoP 2",273
4867,"Plato, however, had not yet developed this self-producing activity, and hence often stumbled into an external teleology
- HoP 2",127
4868,"As the union of the preceding principles, Plato further led this Being into determinateness and into difference, as the latter is contained in the triad of Pythagorean number-determinations, and expressed the same in thought
- HoP 2",232
4870,"Plato finally set forth the belief of Socrates, which the latter put forward in regard to the moral self-reflection of the subject only, as objective, as the Idea, which is both universal thought and the existent
- HoP 2",220
4871,"The previous philosophies thus do not disappear because refuted by Plato, being absorbed in him
- HoP 2",103
4872,"In addition to Being and non-being, one and many, the unlimited and limiting are, for instance, likewise pure thoughts such as these, in whose absolute contemplation, from an all-embracing point of view, the Platonic investigation occupies itself
- HoP 2",254
4873,"The purely logical and quite abstruse consideration of such objects certainly contrasts strongly with our conception of the beautiful, pleasing, and attractive content of Plato
- HoP 2",184
4874,"Such consideration to him signifies all that is best in Philosophy, and it is that which he everywhere calls the true method of Philosophy, and the knowledge of the truth; in it he places the distinction between philosophers and Sophists
- HoP 2",245
4875,"The Sophists on their part look at appearances, and these they obtain in opinion; this, indeed, implies thought, but not pure thought, or what is in and for itself

4876,"This is one reason why many turn from the study of Plato’s works unsatisfied
- HoP 2",84

4878,"We meet with elevated thoughts, which are responded to more specially by youth, but these soon disappear
- HoP 2",112
4880,"For behold, we then come to what is best and highest, to investigations respecting the one and many, Being and nothing; this was not what was anticipated, and men go quietly away, only wondering that Plato should seek knowledge here
- HoP 2",240
4881,"From the most profound dialectic investigation, Plato then again proceeds to representations and images, to the description of dialogues amongst intelligent men
- HoP 2",168
4882,"Thus in the Phædo, for example, which Mendelssohn has modernized and transformed into Wolffian metaphysics, the beginning and end are elevating and beautiful, and the middle deals with dialectic
- HoP 2",202
4883,"Hence in making one’s way through Plato’s Dialogues very many mental qualities are called into play, and in their study we consequently ought to keep our minds open and free as regards the very various points of interest
- HoP 2",228
4884,"If we read with interest what is speculative, we are apt to overlook what is most beautiful; if our interest lies in the elevation and culture of the mind, we forget the speculative element and find that it does not appeal to us

- HoP 2",153
4888,"While Socrates remained at the good and universal, at implicitly concrete thoughts, without having developed them or having revealed them through development, Plato certainly goes on to the Idea as determined

4889,"His defect, however, is that this determinateness and that universality are still outside one another
- HoP 2",109
4890,"Yet when Plato speaks of justice, beauty, goodness, truth, their origin is not revealed; they are not shown as being results, but merely as hypotheses accepted in their immediacy
- HoP 2",186
4891,"Consciousness certainly has an innate conviction that they form the highest end, but this their determination is not discovered
- HoP 2",135
4893,"But those three express the abstract speculative Idea in its pure Notion
- HoP 2",80
4894,"The embracing of the opposites in one, and the expression of this unity, is chiefly lacking in the Parmenides, which has hence, like some other Dialogues, only a negative result
- HoP 2",185
4895,"But both in the Sophist and the Philebus Plato expresses the unity also
- HoP 2",79
4896,"The fully worked-out and genuine dialectic is, however, contained in the Parmenides—that most famous masterpiece of Platonic dialectic
- HoP 2",142
4897,"Parmenides and Zeno are there represented as meeting Socrates in Athens; but the most important part of it is the dialectic which is put in the mouths of Parmenides and Zeno
- HoP 2",181
4899,"This your endeavour is noble and divine
- HoP 2",47
4901,"Socrates now replies to Parmenides: “I believed that I should in that way best discern the like and unlike, and the other general determinations in things” Parmenides replies, “Certainly
- HoP 2",194
4902,"But if you begin from a point of view such as that, you must not only consider what follows from such an hypothesis, but also what follows from the opposite of that hypothesis
- HoP 2",183
4904,"The same consideration must be employed in respect of identity and non-identity, rest and motion, origination and passing away, and likewise in regard to Being and non-being
- HoP 2",181
4906,"Plato makes Socrates say, as regards the meaning of the unity of the one and many, “If anyone proved to me that I am one and many, it would not surprise me
- HoP 2",163
4907,"For since he shows me that I am a many, and points out in me the right and left side, an upper and lower half, a front and back, I partake of the manifold; and again I partake of unity because I am one of us seven
- HoP 2",221
4909,"Though his main endeavour is to show that in every determination the opposite is contained, it can still not be said that this is strictly carried out in all his dialectic movements, for there are often external considerations which exercise an influence in his dialectic
- HoP 2",279
4910,"For example, Parmenides says: “Are either of the two parts of the one which is—I mean the One and Being—ever wanting to one another?
- HoP 2",140
4911,"Is the One ever set free from being a part (τοῦ εἶναι μόριον) and Being set free from the one part (τοῦ ἑνὸς μόριου)?
- HoP 2",125
4912,"Once more, each part thus possesses both the one and Being, and the smallest part still always consists of these two parts”34 In other words: “The one is; from this it follows that the one is not synonymous with ‘is,’ and thus the one and ‘is’ are distinguished
- HoP 2",269
4913,"There hence is in the proposition ‘the one is’ a distinction; the many is therefore contained in it, and thus even with the one I express the many” This dialectic is certainly correct, but it is not quite pure, because it begins from this union of two determinations
- HoP 2",274
4917,"An example is given in Becoming: in Becoming Being and non-being are in inseparable unity, and yet they are also present there as distinguished; for Becoming only exists because the one passes into the other
- HoP 2",215
4918,"In this respect, perhaps, the result arrived at in the Parmenides may not satisfy us, since it seems to be negative in character, and not, as the negation of the negation, expressive of true affirmation
- HoP 2",210
4919,"Nevertheless, the Neo-platonists, and more especially Proclus, regard the result arrived at in the Parmenides as the true theology, as the true revelation of all the mysteries of the divine essence
- HoP 2",205
4920,"And it cannot be regarded as anything else, however little this may at first appear, and though Tiedemann (Platon
- HoP 2",121
4921,"Argumenta, p 340) speaks of these assertions as merely the wild extravagances of the Neo-platonists
- HoP 2",107
4924,"But here there appears the double interpretation already remarked upon (p 19), which has now to be more clearly expounded
- HoP 2",129
4925,"It is that God and the essential reality of things may be understood in two different ways
- HoP 2",98
4927,"These simple realities and their relation and movement seem only to express moments of the objective and not mind, because there is lacking in them one element—that is to say, reflection into themselves—which we demand for the existence of the divine essence
- HoP 2",266
4929,"On the other hand, they may also be taken to be pure Notions, which pertain purely to reflection into itself
- HoP 2",116
4930,"In this case Being is wanting to them, or what we likewise demand for reflection into itself as essential to the divine essence; and then their movement is esteemed an empty round of empty abstractions, which belong only to reflection and have no reality
- HoP 2",262
4931,"For the solution of this contradiction we must know the nature of apprehension and knowledge, in order to obtain in the Notion everything there present
- HoP 2",159
4933,"Plato did not state this knowledge of the nature of the Notion so expressly, nor did he say that this essential Being of things is the same as the divine essence
- HoP 2",169
4934,"But really it is simply not put into words, for the fact is undoubtedly present, and the only distinction is one of speech as between the mode of the ordinary conception and that of the Notion
- HoP 2",200
4937,"In the Sophist Plato investigated the pure Notions or Ideas of movement and rest, self-identity and other-being, Being and non-being
- HoP 2",140
4938,"He here proves, as against Parmenides, that non-being is, and likewise that the simple self-identical partakes of other-being, and unity of multiplicity
- HoP 2",160
4939,"He says of the Sophists that they never get beyond non-being, and he also refutes their whole ground-principle, which is non-being, feeling, and the many
- HoP 2",161
4941,"Plato tried, however, to preserve the difference likewise
- HoP 2",65
4942,"The Sophist is a further development of Being and non-being, both of which are applicable to all things; for because things are different, the one being the other of the other, the determination of the negative is present
- HoP 2",229
4943,"First of all, however, Plato expresses in the Sophist a clearer consciousness of Ideas as abstract universalities, and his conviction that this point of view could not endure, because it was opposed to the unity of the Idea with itself
- HoP 2",243
4944,"Plato thus first refutes what is sensuous, and then even the Ideas themselves
- HoP 2",85
4945,"The first of these points of view is what is later on called materialism, which makes the corporeal alone to be the substantial, admitting nothing to have reality excepting what can be laid hold of by the hand, such as rocks and oaks
- HoP 2",241
4946,"These represent Ideas as immovable, and neither active nor passive
- HoP 2",74
4948,"Examples of this false dialectic to which Plato often comes back, are specially frequent amongst the Sophists; yet he did not show sufficiently clearly how they are distinguished from the purely dialectical knowledge which is in the Notion
- HoP 2",247
4949,"For example, Plato expressed his dissent when Protagoras and others said that no determination is absolutely certain—that bitter is not objective, for what to one person is bitter, to another is sweet
- HoP 2",208
4950,"Similarly, large and small, more and less, &c, are relative, because the large will be, in other circumstances, small, and the small will be great
- HoP 2",154
4951,"That is to say, the unity of opposites is present to us in everything we know, but the common way of looking at things, in which the rational does not come to consciousness, always holds the opposites asunder, as though they were simply opposed in a determinate way
- HoP 2",273
4952,"As in each thing we demonstrate unity, so do we also show its multiplicity, for it has many parts and qualities
- HoP 2",119
4953,"In the Parmenides, Plato, as we saw above (p 58), objected to this unity of opposites, because it must thereby be said that something is one in quite another respect from that in which it is many
- HoP 2",203
4956,"To separate all existences from one another is the crude attempt of an uncultured and unphilosophical mind
- HoP 2",114
4957,"To cause everything to fall asunder means the perfect annihilation of all thought, for thought is the union of ideas”38 Thus Plato expressly speaks against the dialectic of showing how anything may be refuted from some point of view or another
- HoP 2",251
4958,"We see that Plato, in respect of content, expresses nothing excepting what is called indifference in difference, the difference of absolute opposites and their unity
- HoP 2",173
4960,"The second point against which Plato argues is the dialectic of the Eleatics, and their assertion, which in its nature resembles that of the Sophists, that only Being is, and non-being is not
- HoP 2",199
4961,"To the Sophists this means, as Plato puts it: Since the negative is not, but only Being is, there is nothing false; everything existent, everything which is for us, is thus necessarily true, and what is not, we do not know or feel
- HoP 2",238
4963,"Hence it cannot be said that such and such an act is wrong, wicked, a crime; for this would be to say that the maxim of the action is wrong
- HoP 2",147
4964,"No more can it be said that such and such opinion is deceptive, for in the opinion of the Sophists the proposition implies that what I feel or represent to myself, in as far as it is mine, is an affirmative content, and thus true and right
- HoP 2",247
4965,"The proposition in itself seems quite abstract and innocent, but we first notice what is involved in such abstractions when we see them in concrete form
- HoP 2",160
4966,"According to this innocent proposition there would be no wickedness and no crime
- HoP 2",88
4967,"The Platonic dialectic is essentially different from this kind of dialectic
- HoP 2",83
4968,"The myth, which I have already quoted (p 27 et seq
- HoP 2",58
4969,"For that which appears in such conceptions or perceptions as predicate, must be taken for itself, and this is the absolute truth
- HoP 2",136
4970,"This tallies with the nature of the dialectic which has been described
- HoP 2",78
4971,"An action, taken in accordance with the empirical conception, may be called right; in another aspect, quite opposite determinations may be shown to be in it
- HoP 2",164
4972,"But the good and true must be taken on their own account without such individualities, without this empirical and concrete character; and the good and true thus taken alone, constitute that which is
- HoP 2",206
4973,"The soul which, according to the divine drama, is found in matter, rejoices in a beautiful and just object; but the only actual truth is in absolute virtue, justice, and beauty
- HoP 2",184
4974,"It is thus the universal for itself which is further determined in the Platonic dialectic; of this several forms appear, but these forms are themselves still very general and abstract
- HoP 2",191
4975,"Plato’s highest form is the identity of Being and non-being
- HoP 2",67
4976,"The true is that which is, but this Being is not without negation
- HoP 2",73
4977,"Plato’s object is thus to show that non-being is an essential determination in Being, and that the simple, self-identical, partakes of other-being
- HoP 2",154
4978,"This unity of Being and non-being is also found in the Sophists; but this alone is not the end of the matter
- HoP 2",116
4981,"These are the principal points in Plato’s peculiar dialectic
- HoP 2",68
4982,"The fact that the Idea of the divine, eternal, beautiful, is absolute existence, is the beginning of the elevation of consciousness into the spiritual, and into the consciousness that the universal is true
- HoP 2",213
4983,"It may be enough for the ordinary idea to be animated and satisfied by the conception of the beautiful and good, but thinking knowledge demands the determination of this eternal and divine
- HoP 2",196
4984,"And this determination is really only free determination which certainly does not prevent universality—a limitation (for every determination is limitation) which likewise leaves the universal in its infinitude free and independent
- HoP 2",238
4985,"Freedom exists only in a return into itself; the undistinguished is the lifeless; the active, living, concrete universal is hence what inwardly distinguishes itself, but yet remains free in so doing
- HoP 2",206
4986,"Now this determinateness consists in the one being identical with itself in the other, in the many, in what is distinguished
- HoP 2",132
4987,"This constitutes the only truth, and the only interest for knowledge in what is called Platonic philosophy, and if this is not known, the main point of it is not known
- HoP 2",175
4988,"While in the example already often quoted (pp
- HoP 2",53
4990,"But the esoteric is the speculative, which, even though written and printed, is yet, without being any secret, hidden from those who have not sufficient interest in it to exert themselves
- HoP 2",195
4991,"To this esoteric portion pertain the two dialogues hitherto considered, along with which the Philebus may in the third place be taken
- HoP 2",141
4993,"When Plato treats of pleasure and wisdom as contrasted, it is the opposition of finite and infinite
- HoP 2",107
4994,"By pleasure we certainly represent to ourselves the immediately individual, the sensuous; but pleasure is the indeterminate in respect that it is the merely elementary, like fire and water, and not the self-determining
- HoP 2",226
4995,"Only the Idea is the self-determinate, or self-identity
- HoP 2",63
4996,"To our reflection the infinite appears to be what is best and highest, limitation being inferior to it; and ancient philosophers so determined it
- HoP 2",153
4997,"By Plato, however, it is, on the other hand, shown that the limited is the true, as the self-determining, while the unlimited is still abstract; it certainly can be determined in many different ways, but when thus determined it is only the individual
- HoP 2",258
4998,"The infinite is the formless; free form as activity is the finite, which finds in the infinite the material for self-realization
- HoP 2",136
4999,"Plato thus characterizes enjoyment dependent on the senses as the unlimited which does not determine itself; reason alone is the active determination
- HoP 2",157
5000,"But the infinite is what in itself passes over to the finite; thus the perfect good, according to Plato, is neither to be sought for in happiness or reason, but in a life of both combined
- HoP 2",195
5001,"But wisdom, as limit, is the true cause from which what is excellent arises42 As that which posits measure and end, it is what absolutely determines the end—the immanent determination with which and in which freedom likewise brings itself into existence
- HoP 2",261
5002,"Plato further considers the fact that the true is the identity of opposites, thus
- HoP 2",89
5003,"The infinite, as the indeterminate, is capable of a more or less, it may be more intensive or not; thus colder and warmer, drier and moister, quicker and slower, &c, are all such
- HoP 2",186
5005,"Health, happiness, beauty, &c, would thus appear to be begotten, in as far as the opposites are allied thereto, but they are likewise an intermingling of the same
- HoP 2",170
5006,"The ancients make copious use of intermingling, participation, &c, instead of individuality; but for us these are indefinite and inadequate expressions
- HoP 2",159
5007,"But Plato says that the third, which is thus begotten, pre-supposes the cause or that from which it is formed; this is more excellent than those through whose instrumentality that third arose
- HoP 2",199
5008,"Hence Plato has four determinations; first the unlimited, the undetermined; secondly the limited, measure, proportion, to which pertains wisdom; the third is what is mingled from both, what has only arisen; the fourth is cause
- HoP 2",234
5010,"The cause he speaks of is divine reason, which governs the world; the beauty of the world which is present in air, fire, water, and in all that lives, is produced thereby43 Thus the absolute is what in one unity is finite and infinite
- HoP 2",242
5011,"But we are still far from these concrete ideas when we begin with such abstractions as Being, non-being, unity, and multiplicity
- HoP 2",136
5013,"This transition to the concrete is made in the Philebus, since the principle of feeling and of pleasure is there considered
- HoP 2",131
5014,"The ancient philosophers knew very well what they had of concrete in those abstract thoughts
- HoP 2",100
5015,"In the atomic principle of multiplicity we thus find the source of a construction of the state, for the ultimate thought-determination of such state-principles is the logical
- HoP 2",182
5016,"The ancients in their pure Philosophy had not the same end in view as we—they had not the end of a metaphysical sequence placed before them like a problem
- HoP 2",162
5017,"We, on the other hand, have something concrete before us, and desire to reduce it to settled order
- HoP 2",106
5018,"But to live in freedom in the kingdom of thought had become the absolute end to the ancients, and they knew that freedom existed only in thought
- HoP 2",152
5020,"It is more especially where Plato treats of physiology that his statements in no way correspond with what we now know, although we cannot fail to wonder at the brilliant glimpses of the truth there found, which have been only too much misconceived by the moderns
- HoP 2",270
5021,"Plato derived a great deal from the Pythagoreans; how much is theirs, however, cannot be satisfactorily determined
- HoP 2",122
5022,"The Timæus has in all times been esteemed the most difficult and obscure of the Platonic dialogues
- HoP 2",106
5026,"That God is devoid of envy undoubtedly is a great, beautiful, true, and childlike thought
- HoP 2",97
5027,"The later high-minded philosophers controverted this doctrine
- HoP 2",69
5029,"Plato’s thought is thus much higher than that of most of our moderns, who, in saying that God is a hidden God who has not revealed Himself to us and of whom we can know nothing, ascribe jealousy to God
- HoP 2",209
5030,"For why should He not reveal Himself to us if we earnestly seek the knowledge of Him?
- HoP 2",93
5031,"A light loses nothing by another’s being kindled therefrom, and hence there was in Athens a punishment imposed on those who did not permit this to be done
- HoP 2",162
5032,"If the knowledge of God were kept from us in order that we should know only the finite and not attain to the infinite, God would be a jealous God, or God would then become an empty name
- HoP 2",193
5033,"Such talk means no more than that we wish to neglect what is higher and divine, and seek after our own petty interests and opinions
- HoP 2",139
5034,"This humility is sin—the sin against the Holy Ghost
- HoP 2",59
5036,"These are not the philosophic doctrines which Plato seriously held, for he speaks here only after the manner of the ordinary conception, and such expressions have hence no philosophic content
- HoP 2",199
5037,"It is only the introduction of the subject, bringing us, as it does, to determinations such as matter
- HoP 2",109
5038,"Plato then comes in course of his progress to further determinations, and in these we first have the Notion; we must hold to what is speculative in Plato, and not to the first-mentioned ordinary conception
- HoP 2",213
5039,"Likewise, when he says that God esteemed order to be the best, the mode of expression is naïve
- HoP 2",102
5040,"Nowadays we should ask that God should first be proved; and just as little should we allow the visible to be established without much further ado
- HoP 2",153
5041,"What is proved by Plato from this more naïve method of expression is, in the first place, the true determination of the Idea, which only appears later on
- HoP 2",161
5043,"This diremption from which Plato proceeds, is the conclusion which we know from logic; it appears in the form of the ordinary syllogism, in which, however, the whole rationality of the Idea is, at least externally, contained
- HoP 2",232
5044,"The distinctions are the extremes, and the mean is the identity which in a supreme degree makes them one; the conclusion is thus speculative, and in the extremes unites itself with itself, because all the terms pass through all the different positions
- HoP 2",259
5045,"It is hence a mistake to disparage the conclusion and not to recognize it as the highest and absolute form; in respect of the conclusions arrived at by the understanding, on the contrary, we should be right in rejecting it
- HoP 2",230
5046,"This last has no such mean; each of the differences is there recognized as different in its own independent form, as having a character different from that of the other
- HoP 2",176
5047,"This, in the Platonic philosophy, is abrogated, and the speculative element in it constitutes the proper and true form of conclusion, in which the extremes neither remain in independence as regards themselves, nor as regards the mean
- HoP 2",241
5051,"In the Platonic philosophy we thus have what is best and highest; the thoughts are, indeed, merely pure thoughts, but they contain everything in themselves; for all concrete forms depend on thought-determinations alone
- HoP 2",226
5052,"The Fathers thus found in Plato the Trinity which they wished to comprehend and prove in thought: with Plato the truth really has the same determination as the Trinity
- HoP 2",175
5055,"The sundered mean here discovered, again indicates an important thought of logical profundity; and the number four which here appears, is in nature a fundamental number
- HoP 2",176
5056,"For as being the different which is turned towards the two extremes, the mean must be separated in itself
- HoP 2",113
5057,"In the conclusion in which God is the One, the second (the mediating), the Son; the third, the Spirit; the mean indeed is simple
- HoP 2",136
5058,"But the cause why that which in the rational conclusion is merely three-fold, passes in nature to the four-fold, rests in what is natural, because what in thought is immediately the one, becomes separate in Nature
- HoP 2",221
5059,"But in order that in Nature the opposition should exist as opposition, it must itself be a twofold, and thus, when we count, we have four
- HoP 2",145
5060,"This also takes place in the conception of God, for when we apply it to the world, we have nature as mean and the existent spirit as the way of return for nature: when the return is made, this is the absolute Spirit
- HoP 2",223
5061,"This living process, this separation and unifying of differences, is the living God
- HoP 2",91
5062,"Plato says further: “Through this unity the visible and tangible world has been made
- HoP 2",92
5063,"And it comes to pass by God’s having given to it these elements entire and unseparated, that it is perfect, and unaffected by age and disease
- HoP 2",149
5064,"For old age and disease only arise from a body’s being worked upon by a superabundance of such elements from without
- HoP 2",124
5065,"But here this is not so, for the world contains those elements entirely in itself, and nothing can come to it from without
- HoP 2",130
5067,"In the Idea we certainly have determination, limitation, difference, other-being, but it is at the same time dissolved, contained, gathered together, in the one
- HoP 2",168
5068,"Thus it is a difference through which no finitude arises, seeing that it likewise is sublated
- HoP 2",101
5069,"Finitude is thus in the infinite itself, and this is, indeed, a great thought
- HoP 2",85
5070,"This is only a popular way of putting it
- HoP 2",48
5071,"That first God which was only goodness, is, on the contrary, a mere hypothesis, and hence neither determined nor self-determining
- HoP 2",137
5072,"The soul is the ruler, the king, and the body is its subject” It is only Plato’s naïvety which ascribes the reversal of the order of the two to a manner of speech
- HoP 2",170
5073,"What here appears as contingent is really necessary—that is, to begin with the immediate and then come to the concrete
- HoP 2",126
5074,"God, for example, with whom we begin as an immediate, is proved only at the last, and then, indeed, as the true first
- HoP 2",125
5075,"Thus we can, as already remarked, (p 72) show Plato’s confusion of mind in such presentations; but it depends entirely on what Plato’s standard of truth is
- HoP 2",163
5076,"Plato further shows us the nature of the Idea in one of the most famous and profound of passages, where in the essence of the soul he recognizes again the very same idea that he also expressed as the essence of the corporeal
- HoP 2",232
5078,"If we say: “God, the Absolute, is the identity of the identical and non-identical,” a cry is raised of barbarism and scholasticism
- HoP 2",138
5079,"Those who speak of it so still hold Plato in high esteem, and yet it was thus that he determined the truth
- HoP 2",114
5082,"To understand would mean two things, and in the first place, the recognition of their speculative significance, their Notion
- HoP 2",132
5083,"But, as already remarked of the Pythagoreans (Vol
- HoP 2",57
5084,"I p 224), these distinctions of number give only an indefinite conception of difference, and that only in the earlier numbers; where the relationships become more complicated, they are quite incapable of designating them more closely
- HoP 2",241
5085,"In the second place, because of their being numbers, they express, as differences of magnitude, differences in what is sensuous only
- HoP 2",140
5086,"The system of apparent magnitude—and it is in the heavenly system that magnitude appears most purely and freely, liberated from what is qualitative—must correspond to them

- HoP 2",147
5088,"No one of these elements, taken as a succession of simple numbers, can be likened to the system of heavenly spheres, for the series corresponding to this system can, as to its members, contain nothing else than the system of all these moments

5092,"The first mean, brought about through the quadration, is thus in the relation 1 : 2, for example, the proportion 1 : √̅2 : 2; the other is in the same relation, the number 1½
- HoP 2",182
5093,"Hereby new relations arise which are again in a specially given and more difficult method inserted into that first, but this is done in such a way that everywhere something has been left out, and the last relation of number to number is 256 : 243, or 2^8 : 3^5
- HoP 2",268
5094,"Much progress is not, however, made with these number-relations, for they do not present much to the speculative Notion

5100,"This double essence, posited in and for itself in difference, becomes systematized within the one in many moments, which are, however, movements; thus this reality and that essence both pertain to this whole in the antithesis of soul and body, and this again is one
- HoP 2",273
5101,"Mind is what penetrates all, and to it the corporeal is opposed as truly as that it itself is mind
- HoP 2",106
5102,"This is a general description of the soul which is posited in the world and reigns over it; and in as far as the substantial, which is in matter, is similar to it, their inherent identity is asserted
- HoP 2",207
5103,"The fact that in it the same moments which constitute its reality are contained, merely signifies that God, as absolute Substance, does not see anything other than Himself
- HoP 2",179
5106,"In them we have the reason for its appearing as if Plato had here begun to consider from the beginning that of which he has already treated (supra, p 72)
- HoP 2",161
5107,"For since we must begin from the abstract in order to reach the true and the concrete, which first appears later on (supra, p 79), this last, when it has been found, has the appearance and form of a new commencement, particularly in Plato’s loose style
- HoP 2",260
5109,"This second is the system of the heavenly movement, the first is the eternally living
- HoP 2",93
5110,"The second, which has origination and becoming within it, cannot be made perfectly like the first, the eternal Idea
- HoP 2",123
5111,"But it is made a self-moving image of the eternal that remains in the unity; and this eternal image that moves rhythmically, after the manner of numbers, is what we call time
- HoP 2",182
5112,"Plato says of it that we are in the habit of calling the ‘was’ and ‘will be’ parts of time, and we transfer these indications of change which operate in time, into absolute essence
- HoP 2",188
5113,"But the true time is eternal, or the present
- HoP 2",52
5114,"For the substance can neither become older nor younger, and time, as the immediate image of the eternal, has neither the future nor the present in its parts
- HoP 2",164
5115,"Time is ideal, like space, not sensuous, but the immediate mode in which mind comes forth in objective form, the sensuous non-sensuous
- HoP 2",142
5116,"The real moments of the principle of absolute movement in what is temporal, are those in which changes appear
- HoP 2",117
5118,"But this eternal is also in the determinateness of the other reality, in the Idea of the self-changing and variable principle whose universal is matter
- HoP 2",159
5119,"The eternal world has a likeness in the world which belongs to time, but opposed to this there is a second world where change really dwells
- HoP 2",147
5120,"The ‘same’ and the ‘other’ are the most abstract opposes that we hitherto have had
- HoP 2",90
5121,"The eternal world as posited in time has thus two forms—the form of similarity and the form of differentiality, of variability
- HoP 2",134
5122,"The three moments as they appear in the last sphere, are, in the first place, simple essence which is begotten, which has arisen, or determinate matter; secondly the place in which it is begotten, and thirdly that in which what is begotten has its pattern
- HoP 2",263
5123,"Plato gives them thus: “Essence (ὄν), place, and generation” We thus have the conclusion in which space is the mean between individual generation and the universal
- HoP 2",171
5126,"Form is in our reflection distinguished from it, and this, Plato tells us, first comes into existence through the mother
- HoP 2",128
5127,"In this principle we have what we call the phenomenal, for matter is just this subsistence of individual generation, in which division is posited
- HoP 2",153
5128,"But what appears herein is not to be posited as the individual of earthly existence, but is to be apprehended as the universal in such determinateness
- HoP 2",158
5130,"In this world of change form is figure in space; for as in the world, which is the immediate image of the eternal, time is the absolute principle, here the absolute ideal principle is pure matter as such, ie the existence of space
- HoP 2",238
5131,"Space is the ideal essence of this phenomenal world, the mean which unites positivity and negativity, but its determinations are figures
- HoP 2",144
5133,"Here Plato comes to the deduction of configuration, in which the triangle forms the principle; thus triangles form the essence of sensuous things
- HoP 2",153
5134,"Hence he says, in Pythagorean fashion, that the compounding and uniting together of these triangles, as their Idea pertaining to the mean, constitutes once more, according to the original number-relations, the sensuous elements
- HoP 2",235
5135,"This is the principle, but how Plato determines the figures of the elements, and the union of the triangles, I refrain from considering57  From this point Plato passes to a system of Physics and Physiology into which we have no intention of following him
- HoP 2",262
5136,"It is to be regarded as a first, childlike endeavour to understand sensuous phenomena in their manifold character, but as yet it is superficial and confused
- HoP 2",164
5137,"Sensuous manifestations, such as the parts and limbs of the body, are here taken into consideration, and an account of this is given intermingled with thoughts which resemble our formal explanations, and in which the Notion really vanishes
- HoP 2",247
5138,"We have to remember the elevated nature of the Idea, as being the main point of excellence in his explanations, for, as far as the realization of the same is concerned, Plato merely felt and expressed it to be a necessity
- HoP 2",229
5139,"Speculative thought is often recognizable, but, for the most part, consideration is directed to quite external modes of explanation, such as that of end
- HoP 2",160
5140,"The method of treating Physics is a different one from ours, for while with Plato empirical knowledge is still deficient, in modern Physics, on the other hand, the deficiency is found in the Idea
- HoP 2",203
5142,"His manner of relating the physiological to the physical would be as interesting
- HoP 2",88
5143,"Certain portions of his system contain a general element, such as his representation of colours, and from this he goes on to more general considerations
- HoP 2",160
5144,"For when Plato begins to talk on this subject, he says of the difficulty of distinguishing and recognizing the individual, that in the contemplation of nature there are “two causes to be distinguished, the one necessary and the other divine
- HoP 2",248
5148,"But if this part of the soul is once more assuaged, in sleep it participates in visions
- HoP 2",95
5150,"The ancient saying is therefore very true, that only a man who has his wits can act or judge about himself or his own affairs”59 Plato is called the patron saint of mere possession, but, according to this, the assertion is entirely false
- HoP 2",245
5151,"These are the principal points in Plato’s Philosophy of Nature
- HoP 2",70
5153,"The only point of interest for us then in Plato’s philosophy of mind is his view of man’s moral nature; and this real, practical side of consciousness is Plato’s greatest glory, and hence must now be specially dealt with by us
- HoP 2",234
5154,"Its form certainly does not suggest that Plato gave himself much trouble to discover a supreme moral principle, as it is now called, which, for the very reason that it is supposed to be all-embracing, has in it a certain lack of content
- HoP 2",244
5155,"Neither did he trouble himself about a natural right, which is but a trivial abstraction foisted on to the real practical existence, the right; but it is of man’s moral nature that he treats in the Republic
- HoP 2",214
5158,"The same plan should be followed now with justice
- HoP 2",57
5159,"Justice is not only in the individual, but also in the state, and the state is greater than the individual; justice is therefore imprinted on states in larger characters, and is more easily recognizable” (This is different from what the Stoics say of the wise man)
- HoP 2",272
5160,"It was great force of insight that really led the ancients to the truth; and what Plato brings forward as merely simplifying the difficulty, may, in fact, be said to exist in the nature of the thing
- HoP 2",206
5161,"For it is not convenience which leads him to this position, but the fact that justice can be carried out only in so far as man is a member of a state, for in the state alone is justice present in reality and truth
- HoP 2",221
5163,"But the principle of the state again is the objective reality of justice, the reality in which the whole mind is present and not only the knowledge of myself as this individual
- HoP 2",184
5164,"For as the free and reasonable will determines itself, there are laws of freedom; but these laws are nothing else than state-laws, for the Notion of the state implies the existence of a reasoning will
- HoP 2",208
5166,"Thus Plato, in order to discern the features of justice, with the instinct of reason fixes his attention on their manner of representation in the state
- HoP 2",159
5167,"Justice in itself is ordinarily represented by us in the form of a natural right, right in a condition of nature; such a condition of nature is, however, a direct moral impossibility
- HoP 2",190
5168,"That which is in itself is, by those who do not attain to the universal, held to be something natural, as the necessary moments of the mind are held to be innate ideas
- HoP 2",175
5169,"The natural is rather what should be sublated by the mind, and the justice of the condition of nature can only emerge as the absolute injustice of the mind
- HoP 2",163
5170,"In contrast with the state, which is the real spirit, the spirit in its simple and as yet unrealized Notion is the abstract implicitude; this Notion must of course precede the construction of its reality; it is this which is conceived of as a condition of nature
- HoP 2",270
5172,"The fiction of a state of nature starts from the individuality of the person, his free will, and his relation to other persons according to this free will
- HoP 2",162
5173,"Natural justice has thus been a term applied to that which is justice in the individual and for the individual; and the condition of society and of the state has been recognized only as a medium for the individual person, who is the chief end and object
- HoP 2",261
5178,"But since men most be taken as they are, this ideal cannot be realized by reason of men’s wickedness; and to frame such an ideal is therefore altogether idle
- HoP 2",165
5179,"As to this, the first remark to be made is that in the Christian world in general there passes current an ideal of a perfect man which certainly cannot be carried out in the great body of a nation
- HoP 2",204
5181,"For life in the universal and for the universal demands, not that lame and cowardly gentleness, but gentleness combined with a like measure of energy, and which is not occupied with itself and its own sins, but with the universal and what is to be done for it
- HoP 2",267
5182,"They before whose eyes that false ideal floats of course find men to be always compassed with weakness and depravity, and never find that ideal realized
- HoP 2",160
5183,"For they raise into importance the veriest trifles, which no reasonable man would give heed to; and they think such weaknesses and defects are present even when they overlook them
- HoP 2",187
5184,"But we need not esteem this forbearance to be generosity; for it rather implies a perception on their part that from what they call weakness and defect proceeds their own destruction, which comes to pass from their making such defects of importance
- HoP 2",256
5185,"The man who has them is immediately through himself absolved from them, in so far as he makes nothing of them
- HoP 2",117
5186,"The crime is a crime only when they are real to him, and his destruction is in holding them to be something real
- HoP 2",120
5188,"It is contradictory to try to keep intact all our relationships, for in those that otherwise hold good there always is a side where opposition is encountered
- HoP 2",165
5189,"Moreover, what I have already said regarding the relation between philosophy and the state (p 23 et seq)
- HoP 2",112
5190,"When an ideal has truth in itself through the Notion, it is no chimera, just because it is true, for the truth is no chimera
- HoP 2",132
5191,"Such an idea is therefore nothing idle and powerless, but the real
- HoP 2",74
5192,"It is certainly permissible to form wishes, but when pious wishes are all that a man has in regard to the great and true, he may be said to be godless
- HoP 2",158
5193,"It is just as if we could do nothing, because everything was so holy and inviolable, or as if we refused to be anything definite, because all that is definite has its defects
- HoP 2",182
5194,"The true ideal is not what ought to be real, but what is real, and the only real; if an ideal is held to be too good to exist, there must be some fault in the ideal itself, for which reality is too good
- HoP 2",210
5195,"The Platonic Republic would thus be a chimera, not because excellence such as it depicts is lacking to mankind, but because it, this excellence, falls short of man’s requirements
- HoP 2",186
5196,"For what is real, is rational
- HoP 2",37
5197,"The point to know, however, is what exactly is real; in common life all is real, but there is a difference between the phenomenal world and reality
- HoP 2",155
5198,"The real has also an external existence, which displays arbitrariness and contingency, like a tree, a house, a plant, which in nature come into existence
- HoP 2",161
5199,"If the reality of the substance is recognized, the surface where the passions battle must be penetrated
- HoP 2",111
5200,"The temporal and transitory certainly exists, and may cause us trouble enough, but in spite of that it is no true reality, any more than the particularity of the subject, his wishes and inclinations, are so
- HoP 2",214
5201,"In connection with this observation, the distinction is to be called to mind which was drawn when we were speaking above (pp
- HoP 2",132
5203,"No man can overleap his time, the spirit of his time is his spirit also; but the point at issue is, to recognize that spirit by its content
- HoP 2",147
5204,"On the other hand, a constitution that would be perfect in respect to one nation, is to be regarded as not, perhaps, suitable for every nation
- HoP 2",150
5206,"It can, therefore, certainly not be said that a true constitution suits any and every nation; and it is quite the case that for men as they are—for instance, as they are Iroquois, Russians, French—not every constitution is adapted
- HoP 2",238
5207,"For the nation has its place in history
- HoP 2",47
5208,"But as the individual man is trained in the state, that is, as individuality is raised into universality, and the child grows into a man, so is every nation trained; or barbarism, the condition in which the nation is a child, passes over into a rational condition
- HoP 2",271
5209,"Men do not remain at a standstill, they alter, as likewise do their constitutions
- HoP 2",89
5211,"Thus the true constitution stands before the nation of history, so that it may advance towards it
- HoP 2",105
5212,"Every nation in course of time makes such alterations in its existing constitution as will bring it nearer to the true constitution
- HoP 2",139
5213,"The nation’s mind itself shakes off its leading-strings, and the constitution expresses the consciousness of what it is in itself,—the form of truth, of self-knowledge
- HoP 2",175
5214,"If a nation can no longer accept as implicitly true what its constitution expresses to it as the truth, if its consciousness or Notion and its actuality are not at one, then the nation’s mind is torn asunder
- HoP 2",215
5215,"Two things may then occur
- HoP 2",33
5218,"Therefore it is of essential importance to know what the true constitution is; for what is in opposition to it has no stability, no truth, and passes away
- HoP 2",162
5219,"It has a temporary existence, but cannot hold its ground; it has been accepted, but cannot secure permanent acceptance; that it must be cast aside, lies in the very nature of the constitution
- HoP 2",199
5220,"This insight can be reached through Philosophy alone
- HoP 2",60
5221,"Revolutions take place in a state without the slightest violence when the insight becomes universal; institutions, somehow or other, crumble and disappear, each man agrees to give up his right
- HoP 2",200
5223,"The breaking up of its government breaks up the nation itself; a new government arises,—or it may be that the government and the unessential retain the upper hand
- HoP 2",170
5224,"Thus the main thought which forms the groundwork of Plato’s Republic is the same which is to be regarded as the principle of the common Greek morality, namely, that established morality has in general the relation of the substantial, and therefore is maintained as divine
- HoP 2",279
5225,"This is without question the fundamental determination
- HoP 2",62
5226,"The determination which stands in contrast to this substantial relation of the individual to established morality, is the subjective will of the individual, reflective morality
- HoP 2",184
5228,"This principle of subjective freedom is a later growth, it is the principle of our modern days of culture: it, however, entered also into the Greek world, but as the principle of the destruction of Greek state-life
- HoP 2",222
5229,"It was looked on as a crime, because the spirit, political constitution, and laws of the Greeks were not, and could not be calculated to admit of the rise of this principle within them
- HoP 2",192
5230,"Because these two elements were not homogeneous, traditional and conventional morality in Greece was overthrown
- HoP 2",119
5231,"Plato recognized and caught up the true spirit of his times, and brought it forward in a more definite way, in that he desired to make this new principle an impossibility in his Republic
- HoP 2",194
5232,"It is thus a substantial position on which Plato takes his stand, seeing that the substantial of his time forms his basis, but this standpoint is at the same time relative only, in so far as it is but a Greek standpoint, and the later principle is consciously banished
- HoP 2",276
5233,"This is the universal of Plato’s ideal of the state, and it is from this point of view that we must regard it
- HoP 2",117
5234,"Investigations as to whether such a state is possible, and the best possible, which start from quite modern points of view, can only lead us astray
- HoP 2",155
5235,"In modern states we have freedom of conscience, according to which every individual may demand the right of following out his own interests; but this is excluded from the Platonic idea
- HoP 2",192
5237,"The content is but the whole; the nature of the individual, no doubt, but as reflecting itself into the universal, not unbending, or as having absolute validity; so that practically the state and the individual are the same in essence
- HoP 2",242
5239,"Through the development of these moments it becomes living and existing, but these moments are not independent, for they are held in unity
- HoP 2",146
5240,"Plato regards these moments of the moral organism under three aspects, first, as they exist in the state as classes; secondly, as virtues, or moments in morality; thirdly, as moments of the individual subject, in the empirical actions of the will
- HoP 2",254
5241,"Plato does not preach the morality of reflection, he shows how traditional morality has a living movement in itself; he demonstrates its functions, its inward organism
- HoP 2",175
5242,"For it is inner systematization, as in organic life, and not solid, dead unity, like that of metals, which comes to pass by means of the different functions of the organs which go to make up this living, self-moving unity
- HoP 2",229
5243,"Without classes, without this division into great masses, the state has no organism; these great distinctions are the distinction of the substantial
- HoP 2",156
5247,"He accordingly represents three classes, (αα) that of the governors, men of learning and wisdom, (ββ) that of the warriors, (γγ) that of the producers of necessaries, the husbandmen and handicraftsmen
- HoP 2",208
5250,"Then Plato points out that the moments which are here realized in the classes, are moral qualities which are present in individuals, and form their true essence, the simple ethical Notion divided into its universal determinations
- HoP 2",237
5251,"For he states as the result of this distinction of the classes that through such an organism all virtues are present in the commonwealth; he distinguishes four of these,64 and they have been named cardinal virtues
- HoP 2",221
5252,"The state is called wise, by reason of the true knowledge which is realized in the presiding and governing class, who advise regarding the whole state, and decide upon the policy that is best, both at home and in relation to foreign states
- HoP 2",247
5253,"This faculty of perception is properly the peculiar possession of the smallest class65  ββ
- HoP 2",98
5254,"The second virtue is courage (ἀνδρία) which Plato defines as a firm opinion about what may justly and lawfully be considered an object of fear, courage which, in its strength of purpose, remains unshaken either by desires or pleasures
- HoP 2",242
5255,"To this virtue corresponds the class of the warriors66  γγ
- HoP 2",66
5258,"But this virtue is present precisely when no moment, no determination or particularity isolates itself; or, more closely viewed in a moral aspect, it is when no want asserts its reality and thus becomes a crime
- HoP 2",218
5259,"Now work is just this moment of activity concentrating itself on the particular, which nevertheless goes back into the universal, and is for it
- HoP 2",151
5260,"Therefore, if this virtue is universal, it yet has special application to the third class, which at first is the only one to be brought into harmony, as it has not the absolute harmony which the other classes possess in themselves
- HoP 2",238
5261,"Finally, the fourth virtue is justice, which was what Plato began by considering
- HoP 2",88
5263,"The first remark we make on this is, that Plato here places justice on a level with the other moments, and it thus appears as one of the four determinations
- HoP 2",164
5264,"But he now retracts this statement and makes it justice which first gives to wisdom, courage and temperance the power to exist at all, and when they have once come into existence, the power to continue
- HoP 2",209
5266,"Thus the classes or qualities spoken of are nothing else than the moments of this whole
- HoP 2",95
5267,"Justice is only the general and all-pervading quality; but at the same time it implies the independence of every part, to which the state gives liberty of action
- HoP 2",169
5269,"In a highly abstract sense my personality, my altogether abstract freedom, is present in property
- HoP 2",105
5270,"To be sure we find him giving laws concerning property, police regulations, &c, “But,” he says, “to impose laws about such matters on men of noble character does not repay the trouble” In truth, how can we expect to find divine laws in what contains contingencies alone?
- HoP 2",278
5271,"Even in the Laws he considers ethics chiefly, though he gives a certain amount of attention to the rights of property
- HoP 2",125
5272,"To each particular determination justice gives its rights, and thus leads it back into the whole; in this way it is by the particularity of an individual being of necessity developed and brought into actuality, that each man is in his place and fulfils his vocation
- HoP 2",273
5274,"The particular subject, as subject, has in the same way these qualities in himself; and these moments of the subject correspond with the three real moments of the state
- HoP 2",176
5275,"That there is thus one rhythm, one type, in the Idea of the state, forms for Plato’s state a great and grand basis
- HoP 2",122
5276,"This third form, in which the above moments are exhibited, Plato characterizes in the following manner
- HoP 2",110
5277,"There manifest themselves in the subject, first of all sundry wants and desires (ἐπιθυμίαι), like hunger and thirst, each of which has something definite as its one and only object
- HoP 2",188
5278,"But, secondly there is also at the same time to be found in the individual consciousness something else which suspends and hinders the gratification of these desires, and has the mastery over the temptation thus to gratify them; this is reasonableness (λόγος)
- HoP 2",267
5279,"To this corresponds the class of rulers, the wisdom of the state
- HoP 2",72
5280,"Besides these two ideas of the soul there is a third, anger (θυμός), which on one side is allied to the desires, but of which it is just as true that it resists the desires and takes the side of reason
- HoP 2",209
5282,"Therefore wisdom in the state is the same as in the individual, and this is true of courage also
- HoP 2",104
5283,"Even here, where Plato has no consciousness of his abstract ideas, as he has in the Timæus, this of a truth is inwardly present to him, and everything is moulded thereby
- HoP 2",177
5284,"This is given as the plan according to which Plato draws up the great whole
- HoP 2",83
5285,"To fill up the outlines is a mere detail, which in itself has no further interest
- HoP 2",89
5286,"In the second place Plato indicates the means of maintaining the state
- HoP 2",78
5288,"The main point is to train the individuals thereto
- HoP 2",58
5289,"Plato would produce this ethical quality directly in the individuals, and first and foremost in the guardians, whose education is therefore the most important part of the whole, and constitutes the very foundation
- HoP 2",221
5290,"For as it is to the guardians themselves that the care is committed of producing this ethical quality through maintenance of the laws, in these laws special attention must be given to the guardians’ education; after that also to the education of the warriors
- HoP 2",266
5292,"Plato in this passes over the particular means of education, religion, art, science
- HoP 2",91
5293,"Further on he speaks again and more in detail on the question of how far music and gymnastic are to be permitted as means
- HoP 2",129
5295,"At a certain stage of education childish tales do no harm; but were they to be made the foundation of the truth of morality, as present law, the case would be different
- HoP 2",176
5297,"Then it would be high time to place these records on a lower level, as something past, something merely historical
- HoP 2",122
5298,"Plato would further have preambles to the laws, wherein citizens would be admonished as to their duties, and convinced that these exist, &c72 They also should be shown how to choose that which is most excellent, in short, to choose morality
- HoP 2",248
5299,"But here we have a circle: the public life of the state subsists by means of morality, and, conversely, morality subsists by means of institutions
- HoP 2",154
5300,"Morals cannot be independent of institutions, that is, institutions cannot be brought to bear on morals through educational establishments or religion only
- HoP 2",163
5301,"For institutions must be looked on as the very first condition of morality, for this is the manner in which institutions are subjective
- HoP 2",143
5302,"Plato himself gives us to understand how much contradiction he expects to find
- HoP 2",86
5303,"And even now his defect is commonly considered to lie in his being too idealistic, while his real deficiency consists in his not being ideal enough
- HoP 2",155
5304,"For if reason is the universal force, it is essentially spiritual; thus to the realm of the spiritual belongs subjective freedom, which had already been held up as a principle in the philosophy of Socrates
- HoP 2",213
5305,"Therefore reason ought to be the basis of law, and so it is, on the whole
- HoP 2",81
5306,"But, on the other hand, conscience, personal conviction,—in short, all the forms of subjective freedom—are essentially therein contained
- HoP 2",144
5308,"Individual conscience proceeds from the subjectivity of free-will, connects itself with the whole, chooses a position for itself, and thus makes itself a moral fact
- HoP 2",172
5310,"In passing beyond the principle of Greek morality, which in its substantial liberty cannot brook the rise of subjective liberty, the Platonic philosophy at once grasps the above principle, and in so doing proceeds still farther
- HoP 2",235
5311,"It specially harmonizes with this particular quality of excluding the principle of subjectivity, that Plato in the first place does not allow individuals to choose their own class; this we demand as necessary to freedom
- HoP 2",227
5312,"It is not, however, birth which marks off the different ranks, and determines individuals for these; but everyone is tested by the governors of the state, who are the elders of the first class, and have the education of individuals in their hands
- HoP 2",254
5315,"For in it individuality, the individual consciousness, becomes absolute; or the person is looked on as implicit, destitute of all content
- HoP 2",145
5316,"In law, as such, I rank as “this” implicitly and explicitly
- HoP 2",67
5317,"All rank thus, and I rank only because all rank, or I rank only as universal; but the content of this universality is fixed particularity
- HoP 2",145
5318,"But Being to Philosophy is no abstraction, but the unity of the universal and reality, or its content
- HoP 2",109
5319,"The content has therefore weight only in as far as it is negatively posited in the universal; thus only as returning into it, and not absolutely
- HoP 2",152
5320,"In so far as I use things,—not in so far as I have them merely in my possession, or as they have worth for me as existent, as definitely fixed on me,—they stand in living relation to me

5323,"It remains, however, unexplained how in the development of industries, if there is no hope of acquiring private property, there can be any incentive to activity; for on my being a person of energy very much depends my capacity for holding property

- HoP 2",170
5325,"In this way we see subjective freedom consciously removed by Plato himself from his state
- HoP 2",97
5326,"For the same reason Plato also abolishes marriage, because it is a connection in which persons of opposite sex, as such, remain mutually bound to one another, even beyond the mere natural connection
- HoP 2",206
5328,"According to the conception of subjective freedom, however, the family is just as necessary, yea, sacred to the individual as is property

5331,"The women should bear children from the twentieth to the fortieth year, the men should have wives from the thirtieth to the fifty-fifth year
- HoP 2",148
5332,"To prevent incest, all the children born at the time of a man’s marriage shall be known as his children74 The women, whose natural vocation is family life, are by this arrangement deprived of their sphere
- HoP 2",212
5333,"In the Platonic Republic it therefore follows that as the family is broken up, and the women no longer manage the house, they are also no longer private persons, and adopt the manners of the man as the universal individual in the state
- HoP 2",243
5334,"And Plato accordingly allows the women to take their part like the men in all manly labours, and even to share in the toils of war
- HoP 2",138
5336,"Therein, however, lies the very limit of the Platonic Idea—to emerge only as abstract idea
- HoP 2",98
5337,"But, in fact, the true Idea is nothing else than this, that every moment should perfectly realize and embody itself, and make itself independent, while at the same time, in its independence, it is for mind a thing sublated
- HoP 2",230
5338,"In conformity with this Idea, individuality must fully realize itself, must have its sphere and domain in the state, and yet be resolved in it
- HoP 2",150
5339,"The element of the state is the family, that is, the family is the natural unreasoning state; this element must, as such, be present
- HoP 2",140
5341,"The state in general, the whole, must finally pervade all
- HoP 2",65
5342,"But in exactly the same way the formal principle of justice, as abstract universality of personality with individual Being as its existent content, must pervade the whole; one class, nevertheless, specially belongs to it
- HoP 2",228
5344,"These two classes the nation gives up as a part of itself to the principle of individuality, and allows rights to reign here, permitting the constant, the universal, the implicit to be sought in this principle, which really is a principle of variability
- HoP 2",261
5345,"This principle must have its full and complete reality, it must indeed appear in the shape of property
- HoP 2",110
5346,"We have here for the first time the true, actual mind, with each moment receiving its complete independence, and the mind itself attaining to being-another in perfect indifference of Being
- HoP 2",196
5348,"The want of subjectivity is really the want of the Greek moral idea
- HoP 2",75
5349,"The principle which became prominent with Socrates had been present up to this time only in a more subordinate capacity; now it of necessity became an even absolute principle, a necessary moment in the Idea itself
- HoP 2",221
5354,"In this the principle is carried to the very opposite extreme, and has emerged in its utter one-sidedness
- HoP 2",113
5355,"In opposition to this arbitrariness and culture there must be the implicitly and explicitly universal, that which is in thought, not as wise governor or morality, but as law, and at the same time as my Being and my thought, ie as subjectivity and individuality
- HoP 2",268
5356,"Men must have brought forth from themselves the rational along with their interests and their passions, just as it must enter into reality through the necessities, opportunities, and motives that impel them
- HoP 2",214
5357,"There is still another celebrated side of the Platonic philosophy which may be considered, namely æsthetics, the knowledge of the beautiful
- HoP 2",147
5358,"In respect to this, Plato has in like manner seized the one true thought, that the essence of the beautiful is intellectual, the Idea of reason
- HoP 2",151
5359,"The case is the same here as it is with his Idea
- HoP 2",56
5360,"As the essence and truth of phenomena in general is the Idea, the truth of phenomenal beauty must also be this Idea
- HoP 2",123
5361,"The relation to the corporeal, as a relation of the desires, or of pleasure and utility, is no relation to it as the beautiful; it is a relation to it as the sensuous alone, or a relation of particular to particular
- HoP 2",223
5363,"This universal does not, however, retain the form of universality, but the universal is the content whose form is the sensuous mode; and therein lies the determination of the beautiful
- HoP 2",192
5364,"In science, the universal has again the form of the universal or of the Notion; but the beautiful appears as an actual thing—or, when put into words, as a popular conception, in which mode the material exists in mind
- HoP 2",224
5365,"The nature, essence, and content of the beautiful is recognized and judged by reason alone, as its content is the same as that of Philosophy
- HoP 2",148
5366,"But because reason appears in the beautiful in material guise, the beautiful ranks below knowledge, and Plato has for this very reason placed the true manifestation of reason in knowledge, where it is spiritually manifested
- HoP 2",231
5367,"This may be regarded as the kernel of Plato’s philosophy
- HoP 2",64
5369,"Plato’s philosophy had two stages through which it of necessity developed and worked its way up to a higher principle
- HoP 2",125
5371,"But, in the second place, the Neo-Platonists constitute the return, this unity of self-consciousness and the absolute essence; to them God is directly present in reason, reasoned knowledge itself is the Divine Spirit, and the content of this knowledge is the Being of God

5372,"Both of these we shall consider later
- HoP 2",45
5373,"Here we leave Plato, and we do so with regret
- HoP 2",53
5374,"But seeing that we pass to his disciple, Aristotle, we fear that it behoves us to enter even more into detail, since he was one of the richest and deepest of all the scientific geniuses that have as yet appeared—a man whose like no later age has ever yet produced
- HoP 2",271
5375,"Because we still possess so large a number of his works, the extent of the material at hand is proportionately greater; unfortunately, however, I cannot give to Aristotle the amount of attention that he deserves
- HoP 2",219
5378,"For most of the philosophic sciences have to render thanks to him both for their characterization and first commencement
- HoP 2",128
5379,"But although in this way Science throughout falls into a succession of intellectual determinations of determinate Notions, the Aristotelian philosophy still contains the profoundest speculative Notions

- HoP 2",94
5382,"We need not try to demonstrate necessity from the standpoint of the philosophy of that time
- HoP 2",99
5383,"But although Aristotle’s system does not appear to be developed in its parts from the Notion, and its parts are merely ranged side by side, they still form a totality of truly speculative philosophy
- HoP 2",206
5385,"For to him views are ascribed diametrically opposite to his philosophy
- HoP 2",78
5386,"And while Plato is much read, the treasures contained in Aristotle have for centuries, and until quite modern times, been as good as unknown, and the falsest prejudices reign respecting him
- HoP 2",197
5387,"Almost no one knows his speculative and logical works; in modern times more justice has been done to his writings regarding nature, but not to his philosophic views
- HoP 2",172
5388,"For instance, there is a quite generally held opinion that the Aristotelian and Platonic philosophies are directly opposed, the one being idealistic and the other realistic, and that, indeed, in the most trivial sense
- HoP 2",225
5390,"But we shall see how little this really is the case
- HoP 2",59
5391,"In fact Aristotle excels Plato in speculative depth, for he was acquainted with the deepest kind of speculation—idealism—and in this upholds the most extreme empirical development

- HoP 2",256
5400,"He also requited Proxenus for the education given him, by later on bringing up his son Nicanor, adopting him as his own son and making him his heir

5402,"I p 167), this is shown, by the evident facts of the case, to be an arbitrary and quite unfounded assumption
- HoP 2",116
5405,"However, Plato had nevertheless Aristotle as his successor, for Aristotle understood Philosophy in Plato’s sense, though his philosophy was deeper and more worked out, and thus he carried it further

- HoP 2",108
5409,"In order to avoid a similar fate, Aristotle fled with his wife Pythias, the daughter of Hermias, to Mitylene, and lived there for some time
- HoP 2",147
5410,"He, however, erected a statue to Hermias in Delphi, with an inscription which has been preserved

5415,"Alexander’s education utterly refuted the common talk about the practical uselessness of speculative philosophy
- HoP 2",119
5416,"Aristotle had in Alexander another and worthier pupil than Plato found in Dionysius
- HoP 2",91
5417,"Plato’s great interest was his Republic, the ideal of a state; he enters into relation with a person through whom it might be carried out; the individual was thus to him a medium only, and in so far indifferent to him
- HoP 2",225
5418,"With Aristotle, on the other hand, this purpose was not present, he merely had the simple individual before him; and his end was to bring up and to develop the individuality as such
- HoP 2",189
5419,"Aristotle is known to be a profound, thorough, and abstract metaphysician, and it is evident that he meant seriously with Alexander
- HoP 2",139
5420,"That Aristotle did not follow with Alexander the ordinary superficial method of educating princes, might be confidently expected from the earnestness of one who well knew what was truth and true culture
- HoP 2",210
5422,"To this Aristotle replied that, though published, they were really just as much unpublished as before82  This is not the place to estimate Alexander as an historic personage
- HoP 2",181
5426,"Alexander thereby also avenged the faithlessness and cruelty perpetrated by the Persians on Aristotle’s friend Hermias
- HoP 2",126
5427,"But Alexander further disseminated Greek culture over Asia, in order to elevate into a Greek world this wild medley of utter barbarism, bent solely on destruction, and torn by internal dissensions, these lands entirely sunk in indolence, negation, and spiritual degeneracy
- HoP 2",280
5429,"Thus Alexander did not found an extensive kingdom for his family, but he founded a kingdom of the Greek nation over Asia; for Greek culture and science have since his time taken root there

5430,"The Greek kingdoms of Asia Minor, and particularly of Egypt, were for centuries the home of science; and their influence may have extended as far as to India and to China

- HoP 2",109
5440,"Alexander’s expedition has quite another historic, military, and political character than this, and had not much to do with his going to India; it was, on the face of it, an ordinary conquest
- HoP 2",199
5441,"In the second place, Aristotle’s metaphysic and philosophy is far from recognizing any such foolish and extravagant imaginations
- HoP 2",136
5442,"The elevation of Alexander in the Oriental mind into an acknowledged hero and god, which followed later, is, in the third place, not matter for surprise; the Dalai-Lama is still thus honoured, and God and man are never so very far asunder
- HoP 2",246
5443,"Greece likewise worked its way to the idea of a God becoming man, and that not as a remote and foreign image, but as a present God in a godless world: Demetrius Phalereus and others were thus soon after honoured and worshipped in Athens as God
- HoP 2",251
5444,"Was the infinite not also now transplanted into self-consciousness?
- HoP 2",75
5447,"This consideration on Alexander’s part afforded to Aristotle a most favourable opportunity of collecting treasures for his study of nature
- HoP 2",146

5451,"He lived and taught in Athens for thirteen years
- HoP 2",56

5461,"Doubts regarding their genuine character could not in such circumstances fail to exist; and we can only wonder at seeing them come down to us even in the condition in which they are
- HoP 2",189
5462,"For, as we have said, Aristotle made them known but little during his lifetime, and he left his writings to Theophrastus, his successor, with the rest of his immense library
- HoP 2",181
5463,"This, indeed, is the first considerable library, collected as it was by means of personal wealth along with Alexander’s assistance, and hence it also reveals to us Aristotle’s learning
- HoP 2",192
5464,"Later on, it came partially, or in some cases in duplicate, to Alexandria, and formed the basis of the Ptolemaic library, which, on the taking of Alexandria by Julius Cæsar, became a prey to fire
- HoP 2",203
5466,"Finally, the descendants of Theophrastus found them again after long search, and sold them to Apellicon of Teos, who restored what had been destroyed by worms and mould, but who did not possess the learning or the capacity so to do
- HoP 2",239
5467,"Hence others went over them, filled up the blanks as they thought best, replaced what was damaged, and thus they were sufficiently altered
- HoP 2",146
5468,"But still it was not enough
- HoP 2",35
5469,"Just after Apellicon’s death, the Roman Sulla conquered Athens, and amongst the spoil carried off to Rome were the works of Aristotle

5470,"The Romans, who had just begun to become acquainted with Greek science and art, but who did not yet appreciate Greek philosophy, did not know how to profit from this spoil
- HoP 2",179
5472,"Aristotle certainly made known much to his contemporaries, that is to say, the writings in the Alexandrian library, but even those works do not seem to have been widely known
- HoP 2",182
5473,"In fact, many of them are most corrupt, imperfect, and, as, for example, the Poetics, incomplete
- HoP 2",104
5475,"Since the evil is so old, no real cure can certainly be looked for; however, the matter is not so bad as would appear from this description
- HoP 2",147
5476,"There are many and important works which may be considered to be entire and uninjured, and though there are others corrupt here and there, or not well arranged, yet, as far as the essentials are concerned, no such great harm has been done as might appear
- HoP 2",262
5477,"What we possess therefore places us in a sufficiently good position to form a definite idea of the Aristotelian philosophy, both as a whole, and in many of its details
- HoP 2",175
5478,"But there is still an historic distinction to be noted
- HoP 2",62
5479,"For there is an old tradition that Aristotle’s teaching was of a twofold nature and that his writings were of two different kinds, viz esoteric or acroamatic and exoteric—a distinction which was also made by the Pythagoreans (Vol

5481,"It first of all signifies Aristotelian philosophy proper
- HoP 2",64
5483,"This period does not appear to have taken any interest in working out and bringing to consciousness the deep and properly speaking speculative side of Aristotelian philosophy, and indeed with Cicero there is no notion of it present
- HoP 2",239
5485,"An important signification of the expression, in the fourth place, is that which it had in the middle ages where, through insufficient knowledge, the scholastic philosophy was designated Aristotelian
- HoP 2",207
5486,"The Scholastics occupied themselves much with it, but the form that the philosophy of Aristotle took with them cannot be held by us to be the true form
- HoP 2",159
5487,"All their achievements, and the whole extent of the metaphysics of the understanding and formal logic which we discover in them, do not belong to Aristotle at all
- HoP 2",170
5488,"Scholasticism is derived only from traditions of the Aristotelian doctrines
- HoP 2",83
5489,"For it was only after the Reformation that men went back to the fountainhead, to Aristotle himself
- HoP 2",106
5490,"The sixth signification which Aristotelian philosophy bears, is found in false modern ideas and conceptions, such as those that we find in Tennemann, who is gifted with too little philosophic understanding to be able to grasp the Aristotelian philosophy (Vol
- HoP 2",266
5491,"Indeed, the general opinion of Aristotelian philosophy now held is that it made what is called experience the principle of knowledge
- HoP 2",140
5492,"However false this point of view on the one hand is, the occasion for it may be found in the Aristotelian manner
- HoP 2",120
5493,"Some particular passages to which in this reference great importance has been given, and which have been almost the only passages understood, are made use of to prove this idea
- HoP 2",184
5494,"Hence we have now to speak of the character of the Aristotelian manner
- HoP 2",78
5496,"But because in so doing Aristotle has a quality, altogether his own, of being throughout intensely speculative in his manner, it is further signified that in the first place he has comprehended the phenomenal as a thinking observer
- HoP 2",239
5497,"He has the world of appearance before himself complete and in entirety, and sets nothing aside, however common it may appear
- HoP 2",132

- HoP 2",220
5500,"But Aristotle, because he looks at all sides of the universe, takes up all those units as a speculative philosopher, and so works upon them that the profoundest speculative Notion proceeds therefrom
- HoP 2",206
5501,"We saw, moreover, thought first proceeding from the sensuous, and, in Sophistry, still exercising itself immediately in the phenomenal
- HoP 2",142
5502,"In perception, in ordinary conception, the categories appear: the absolute essence, the speculative view of these elements, is always expressed in expressing perceptions
- HoP 2",177
5503,"This pure essence in perception Aristotle takes up
- HoP 2",58
5505,"But, on the one hand, this mode presents a complete series of the moments, and on the other, it arouses personal investigation for the discovery of necessity
- HoP 2",165
5506,"In the third place, Aristotle takes up the different thoughts which earlier philosophers have had, contradicts them—often empirically—justifies them, reasoning in all sorts of ways, and then attains to the truly speculative point of view
- HoP 2",245
5508,"But Aristotle has the patience to go through all conceptions and questions, and from the investigation of the individual determinations, we have the fixed, and once more restored determination of every object
- HoP 2",216
5509,"Aristotle thus forms the Notion, and is in the highest degree really philosophic, while he appears to be only empiric
- HoP 2",125
5510,"For Aristotle’s empiricism is a totality because he always leads it back again immediately to speculation; he may thus be said to be a perfect empiricist, yet at the same time a thinking one
- HoP 2",198
5511,"If, for example, we take away from space all its empirical determinations, the result will be in the highest degree speculative, for the empirical, comprehended in its synthesis, is the speculative Notion
- HoP 2",212
5512,"In this gathering up of determinations into one Notion, Aristotle is great and masterly, as he also is in regard to the simplicity of his method of progression, and in the giving of his decisions in few words
- HoP 2",216
5513,"This is a method of treating of Philosophy which has great efficacy, and which in our time has likewise been applied, eg by the French
- HoP 2",142
5514,"It deserves to come into larger use, for it is a good thing to lead the determinations of the ordinary conception from an object to thought, and then to unite them in a unity, in the Notion
- HoP 2",197
5515,"But undoubtedly this method in one respect appears to be empirical, and that, indeed, in the acceptation of objects as we know them in our consciousness; for if no necessity is present, this still more appears merely to pertain to manner externally regarded
- HoP 2",265
5516,"And yet it cannot be denied that with Aristotle the object was not to bring everything to a unity, or to reduce determinations to a unity of opposites, but, on the contrary, to retain each in its determination and thus to follow it up
- HoP 2",242
5519,"However, in his genuine speculation Aristotle is as profound as Plato, and at the same time more developed and explicit, for with him the opposites receive a higher determination
- HoP 2",186
5520,"Certainly we miss in him the beauty of Plato’s form, the melodious speech, or, as we might almost call it, chatting—the conversational tone adopted, which is as lively as it is cultured and human
- HoP 2",203
5522,"The study of Aristotle is hence inexhaustible, but to give an account of him is difficult, because his teaching must be reduced to universal principles
- HoP 2",159
5523,"Thus in order to set forth Aristotelian philosophy, the particular content of each thing would have to be specified
- HoP 2",123
5524,"But if we would be serious with Philosophy, nothing would be more desirable than to lecture upon Aristotle, for he is of all the ancients the most deserving of study
- HoP 2",173
5525,"For through these and from these all else is known, but principles do not become known through the facts which form their groundwork (ὑποκείμενα)
- HoP 2",153
5526,"In this we already have the opposite to the ordinary point of view
- HoP 2",74
5527,"Aristotle has further declared the chief subject of investigation, or the most essential knowledge (ἐπιστήμη ἀρχικωτάτη) to be the knowledge of end; but this is the good in each thing and, generally speaking, the best in the whole of nature
- HoP 2",248
5528,"This also holds good with Plato and Socrates; yet the end is the true, the concrete, as against the abstract Platonic Idea
- HoP 2",130
5529,"Aristotle then says of the value of Philosophy, “Men have begun to philosophize through wonder,” for in it the knowledge of something higher is at least anticipated
- HoP 2",172
5530,"This is also made evident by the whole course of its external history
- HoP 2",77
5531,"For it was after men had done with all their absolute requirements, and with what concerns their comfort, that they first began to seek this philosophic knowledge
- HoP 2",170
5532,"And thus as we say that a free man is he who exists on his own account and not for another, Philosophy is the only science that is free, because it alone exists for itself—it is knowledge on account of knowledge
- HoP 2",219
5533,"Therefore in justice it will not be held to be a human possession,” in the sense that, as we said above, (p 11) it is not in the possession of a man
- HoP 2",156
5534,"But if the poets were right, and envy characterized divinity, all who would aim higher must be unfortunate;” Nemesis punishes whatever raises itself above the commonplace, and makes everything again equal
- HoP 2",212
5536,"In the latter there are myths, and we can pass over the dialectic and yet say that we have read Plato; but with Aristotle we enter at once upon what is speculative
- HoP 2",171
5537,"Aristotle always seems to have philosophized only respecting the individual and particular, and not to have risen from it to the thought of the absolute and universal, to the thought of God; he always goes from the individual to the individual
- HoP 2",251
5539,"This has nothing dazzling about it, for he does not appear to have risen to the Idea (as Plato speaks of the nobility of Idea), nor to have led back to it the individual
- HoP 2",177
5543,"Aristotle’s speculative Idea is chiefly to be gathered from his Metaphysics, especially from the last chapters of the twelfth book (Λ) which deal with the divine Thought
- HoP 2",177
5544,"But this treatise has the peculiar drawback noticed above (p 128) of being a compilation, several treatises having been combined into one
- HoP 2",145
5546,"This pure philosophy Aristotle very clearly distinguishes (Metaph
- HoP 2",73
5547,"In this ontology or, as we call it, logic, he investigates and minutely distinguishes four principles (Metaph
- HoP 2",117
5548,"In the later part of the Metaphysics Aristotle returns repeatedly to the determination of the Ideas, but here also a want of connection of thought appears, even though all is subsequently united into an entirely speculative Notion
- HoP 2",238
5550,"These are determinations which occur repeatedly in Aristotle, especially in the ninth book of the Metaphysics, and which we must be familiar with, if we would understand him
- HoP 2",181
5551,"The expression δύναμις is with Aristotle the beginning, the implicit, the objective; also the abstract universal in general, the Idea, the matter, which can take on all forms, without being itself the form-giving principle
- HoP 2",230
5552,"But with an empty abstraction such as the thing-in-itself Aristotle has nothing to do
- HoP 2",93
5553,"It is first in energy or, more concretely, in subjectivity, that he finds the actualizing form, the self-relating negativity
- HoP 2",132
5554,"To Aristotle the main fact about Substance is that it is not matter merely (Metaph
- HoP 2",90
5555,"All that is contains matter, it is true, all change demands a substratum (ὑποκείμενον) to be affected by it; but because matter itself is only potentiality, and not actuality—which belongs to form—matter cannot truly exist without the activity of form (Metaph
- HoP 2",267
5556,"With Aristotle δύναμις does not therefore mean force (for force is really an imperfect aspect of form), but rather capacity which is not even undetermined possibility; ἐνέργεια is, on the other hand, pure, spontaneous activity
- HoP 2",234
5557,"These definitions were of importance throughout all the middle ages
- HoP 2",75
5558,"Thus, according to Aristotle, the essentially absolute substance has potentiality and actuality, form and matter, not separated from one another; for the true objective has most certainly also activity in itself, just as the true subjective has also potentiality
- HoP 2",270
5559,"From this definition we now see clearly the sort of opposition in which the Idea of Aristotle stands to that of Plato, for although the Idea of Plato is in itself essentially concrete and determined, Aristotle goes further
- HoP 2",230
5560,"In so far, namely, as the Idea is determined in itself, the relation of the moments in it can be more closely specified, and this relation of the moments to each other is to be conceived of as nothing other than activity
- HoP 2",228
5561,"It is easy for us to have a consciousness of what is deficient in the universal, that is, of that which is implicit only
- HoP 2",128
5562,"The universal, in that it is the universal, has as yet no reality, for because implicitude is inert, the activity of realization is not yet posited therein
- HoP 2",163
5563,"Reason, laws, etc, are in this way abstract, but the rational, as realizing itself, we recognize to be necessary, and therefore we take such universal laws but little into account
- HoP 2",187
5564,"Now the standpoint of Plato is in the universal; what he does is to express Being rather as the objective, the Good, the end, the universal
- HoP 2",147
5565,"To this, however, the principle of living subjectivity, as the moment of reality, seems to be lacking, or it appears at least to be put in the background
- HoP 2",161
5567,"But with Aristotle this negativity, this active efficacy, is expressly characterized as energy; in that it breaks up itself—this independence—abrogating unity, and positing separation; for, as Aristotle says (Metaph
- HoP 2",223
5569,"The principle of individualization, not in the sense of a casual and merely particular subjectivity, but in that of pure subjectivity, is peculiar to Aristotle
- HoP 2",167
5570,"Aristotle thus also makes the Good, as the universal end, the substantial foundation, and maintains this position against Heraclitus and the Eleatics
- HoP 2",157
5571,"The Becoming of Heraclitus is a true and real determination, but change yet lacks the determination of identity with itself, the constancy of the universal
- HoP 2",163
5572,"The stream is ever changing, yet it is nevertheless ever the same, and is really a universal existence
- HoP 2",110
5573,"From this it is at once evident that Aristotle (Metaph
- HoP 2",62
5574,"I p 282), and in connection with this lays down the celebrated maxim of contradiction, that a man is not at the same time a ship
- HoP 2",136
5575,"This shows at once that Aristotle does not understand by this pure Being and non-being, this abstraction which is really only the transition of the one into the other; but by that which is, he understands Substance, the Idea, Reason, viewed likewise as an impelling end
- HoP 2",277
5576,"As he maintains the universal against the principle of mere change, he puts forward activity in opposition to the numbers of the Pythagoreans, and to the Platonic Ideas
- HoP 2",176
5577,"However frequently and fully Aristotle controverts both of these, all his objections turn on the remark already quoted (Vol
- HoP 2",131
5578,"I p 213) that activity is not to be found in these principles, and that to say that real things participate in Ideas is empty talk, and a poetic metaphor
- HoP 2",161
5579,"He says also that Ideas, as abstract universal determinations, are only as far as numbers go equal to things, but are not on that account to be pointed out as their causes
- HoP 2",179
5580,"Moreover, he maintains that there are contradictions involved in taking independent species, since in Socrates, for instance, there are several ideas included: man, biped, animal (Metaph
- HoP 2",194
5582,"This is the chief point which Aristotle deals with
- HoP 2",58
5583,"Aristotle distinguishes various moments in substance, in so far as the moments of activity and potentiality do not appear as one, but still in separation
- HoP 2",161
5584,"The closer determination of this relation of energy to potentiality, of form to matter, and the movement of this opposition, gives the different modes of substance
- HoP 2",171
5585,"Here Aristotle enumerates the substances; and to him they appear as a series of different kinds of substance, which he merely takes into consideration one by one, without bringing them together into a system
- HoP 2",215
5586,"The three following are the chief among these:—  a
- HoP 2",58
5587,"The sensuous perceptible substance is that in which the matter is still distinguished from the efficient form
- HoP 2",117
5588,"Hence this substance is finite; for the separation and externality of form and matter are precisely what constitute the nature of the finite
- HoP 2",148
5589,"Sensuous substance, says Aristotle (Metaph
- HoP 2",50
5590,"Now the leading categories of change which Aristotle names are the four differences, in regard to the What (κατὰ τὸ τί), or in regard to quality (ποιόν), or in regard to quantity (ποσόν), or in regard to place where (ποῦ)
- HoP 2",229
5591,"The first change is the origination and decay of simple determinate Being (κατὰ τόδε); the second change is that of the further qualities (κατὰ τὸ πάθος); the third, increase and diminution; the fourth, motion
- HoP 2",217
5592,"Matter is the dead substance on which take place the changes which matter passes through
- HoP 2",96
5594,"Matter is thus simple potentiality, which, however, is placed in opposition to itself, so that a thing in its actuality only becomes that which its matter was also in potentiality
- HoP 2",187
5596,"Thus in sensuous substance there appears the diversity of the moments, though not as yet their return into themselves; but activity is the negative which ideally contains in itself the opposite, therefore that also which is about to be
- HoP 2",243
5597,"A higher kind of substance, according to Aristotle (Metaph
- HoP 2",66
5598,"This is understanding, absolutely determined, whose content is the aim which it realizes through its activity, not merely changing as does the sensuous form
- HoP 2",164
5599,"For the soul is essentially actuality, a general determination which posits itself; not only formal activity, whose content comes from somewhere else
- HoP 2",157
5600,"But while the active posits its content in reality, this content yet remains the same; there is an activity present which is different from matter, although substance and activity are allied
- HoP 2",198
5601,"Thus here we still have a matter which understanding demands as its hypothesis
- HoP 2",86
5602,"The two extremes are matter as potentiality, and thought as efficiency: the former is the passive universal, and the latter the active universal; in sensuous substance the active is, on the contrary, still quite different from matter
- HoP 2",241
5603,"In these two moments themselves change does not take place, for they are the implicit universal in opposed forms
- HoP 2",120
5604,"For matter as such is passive and affected by change, consequently it is not simply one with the pure activity of this substance
- HoP 2",136
5605,"Here as elsewhere we certainly see an instance of merely denying a predicate, without saying what its truth is; but matter is nothing else than that moment of unmoved Being
- HoP 2",180
5606,"If in later times it has seemed something new to define absolute Being as pure activity, we see that this arises from ignorance as to the Aristotelian conception
- HoP 2",169
5607,"But the Schoolmen rightly looked upon this as the definition of God, since they define God as actus purus; and higher idealism than this there is none
- HoP 2",158
5608,"We may also express this as follows: God is the Substance which in its potentiality has reality also unseparated from it; therein potentiality is not distinguished from form, since it produces from itself the determinations of its content
- HoP 2",246
5609,"In this Aristotle breaks away from Plato, and for this reason controverts number, the Idea, and the universal, because if this, as inert, is not defined as identical with activity, there is no movement
- HoP 2",209
5610,"Plato’s inert Ideas and numbers thus bring nothing into reality; but far different is the case with the Absolute of Aristotle, which in its quiescence is at the same time absolute activity
- HoP 2",196
5611,"Aristotle further says on this subject (Metaph
- HoP 2",54
5612,"And even this is insufficient, if it is not active, because in that case there is no change
- HoP 2",99
5613,"Yea, even if it were active, but its substance only a potentiality, there would be in it no eternal movement, for it is possible that what is according to potentiality may not exist
- HoP 2",189
5614,"We must therefore have a principle whose substance must be apprehended as activity” Thus in mind energy is substance itself
- HoP 2",131
5615,"For all that is active seems to be possible, but all that is possible does not seem to energize, so that potentiality seems to be antecedent,” for it is the universal
- HoP 2",174
5616,"But energy is higher than potentiality
- HoP 2",46
5617,"We must thus not assert, as theologians would have us do, that in the eternal ages there was first chaos or night” (matter), “nor must we say with natural philosophers that everything existed simultaneously
- HoP 2",214
5618,"For how could the First be changed, if nothing in reality were cause?
- HoP 2",77
5619,"For matter does not move itself, it is the Master who moves it
- HoP 2",70
5620,"Leucippus and Plato accordingly say that motion has always existed, but they give no reason for the assertion” Pure activity is, according to Aristotle (Metaph
- HoP 2",167
5622,"That which moves in itself, and therefore, as Aristotle continues (Metaph
- HoP 2",81
5623,"As the self-identical which is visible, this absolute Being is “the eternal heavens” The two modes of representing the Absolute are thus thinking reason and the eternal heavens
- HoP 2",184
5624,"The heavens are moved, but they also cause movement
- HoP 2",59
5626,"He explains this as follows: “Its motion is determined in the following manner
- HoP 2",86
5627,"That moves which is desired and thought, whereas itself it is unmoved, and the original of both is the same” That is the end whose content is the desire and thought; such an end is the Beautiful or the Good
- HoP 2",214
5630,"Such are the Beautiful and the Good, and the first is ever the absolutely best or the best possible
- HoP 2",107
5631,"But the Notion shows that the final cause belongs to the unmoved
- HoP 2",72
5632,"What is moved may also subsist in a different manner
- HoP 2",60
5635,"On such a principle of the unmoved the heavens depend and the whole of nature”—the visible that is eternal, and the visible that changes
- HoP 2",144
5636,"This system is ever-enduring
- HoP 2",36
5637,"For the system continues ever the same, but for us that is impossible
- HoP 2",77
5638,"Now this activity is in its very self enjoyment, and therefore vigilance, exercise of the senses, thinking in general, are most productive of enjoyment; and for the same reason hopes and memories bring pleasure
- HoP 2",218
5639,"But thinking, in its pure essence, is a thinking of that which is absolutely the most excellent;” the thought is for itself absolute end
- HoP 2",144
5641,"The object of thought is first produced in the activity of thinking, which in this way separates the thought as an object
- HoP 2",129
5643,"The chief moment in Aristotle’s philosophy is accordingly this, that the energy of thinking and the object of thought are the same; “for thought is that which is receptive of objects of perception and the existent
- HoP 2",221
5644,"It is not the object of thought that is the more excellent, but the very energy of thinking; the activity of apprehension brings that to pass which appears as something that is being apprehended
- HoP 2",202
5646,"But this is His mode of subsistence
- HoP 2",43
5647,"Life is also inherent in Him, for the activity of thought is life
- HoP 2",73
5648,"But He constitutes this efficient power; essential energy belongs to God as His most excellent and eternal life
- HoP 2",119
5649,"We therefore say that with God there is life perfect and everlasting” From this substance Aristotle moreover excludes magnitude
- HoP 2",135
5650,"With Aristotle it is thus no dry identity of the abstract understanding that is indicated, for he distinguishes subjective and objective precisely and decisively
- HoP 2",169
5651,"Not dead identity such as this, but energy, is for him what is most to be reverenced, God
- HoP 2",97
5652,"Unity is thus a poor, unphilosophic expression, and true Philosophy is not the system of identity; its principle is a unity which is activity, movement, repulsion, and thus, in being different, is at the same time identical with itself
- HoP 2",243
5653,"If Aristotle had made the jejune identity of understanding, or experience, his principle, he would never have risen to a speculative Idea like this, wherein individuality and activity are placed higher than universal potentiality
- HoP 2",237
5654,"Thought, as the object of thought, is nothing else than the absolute Idea regarded as in itself, the Father; yet this First and unmoved, as distinguished from activity, is, as absolute, simply activity, and is first through this activity set forth as true
- HoP 2",263
5656,"He does not say that it alone is truth, that all is summed up in Thought, but he says it is the first, the strongest, the most honourable
- HoP 2",145
5657,"We, on the other hand, say that Thought, as that which relates to itself, has existence, or is the truth; that Thought comprehends the whole of Truth, even, though we ordinarily represent to ourselves sensation and so on, besides thought, as having reality
- HoP 2",264
5658,"Thus, although Aristotle does not express himself in modern philosophic language, he has yet throughout the same fundamental theory; he speaks not of a special kind of reason, but of the universal Reason
- HoP 2",211
5659,"The speculative philosophy of Aristotle simply means the direction of thought on all kinds of objects, thus transforming these into thoughts; hence, in being thoughts, they exist in truth
- HoP 2",195
5660,"The meaning of this is not, however, that natural objects have thus themselves the power of thinking, but as they are subjectively thought by me, my thought is thus also the Notion of the thing, which therefore constitutes its absolute substance
- HoP 2",253
5661,"But in Nature the Notion does not exist explicitly as thought in this freedom, but has flesh and blood, and is oppressed by externalities; yet this flesh and blood has a soul, and this is its Notion
- HoP 2",206
5663,"It is only in thought that there is present a true harmony between objective and subjective; that constitutes me
- HoP 2",120
5664,"Aristotle therefore finds himself at the highest standpoint; nothing deeper can we desire to know, although he has always the appearance of making ordinary conceptions his starting-point
- HoP 2",194
5665,"And when it thinks, but something else is dominant all the time (ἄλλο κύριον), that which is its substance is not thought (νόησις), but a potentiality;” it would not be in eternal activity
- HoP 2",196
5666,"If now, further, thought or thinking is its substance, what does it think?
- HoP 2",82
5667,"Itself or another?
- HoP 2",26
5668,"And if another, is it always the same, or something different?
- HoP 2",70
5669,"Does it also not make a difference, whether it thinks of what is beautiful or what is casual?
- HoP 2",101
5670,"In the first place, if thought is not thinking, but only the power to think, continuous thinking would be laborious for it,” for every power wears itself out
- HoP 2",165
5671,"As this is to be avoided (in the same way that it is better not to see some things than to see them), thinking would not constitute the best
- HoP 2",148
5672,"Thought is therefore this, to think itself, because it is the most excellent; and it is the thinking, which is the thinking of thinking
- HoP 2",143
5673,"For understanding and sensation and opinion and deliberation seem always to have an object other than themselves, and to be their own objects only in a secondary sense
- HoP 2",175
5674,"Further, if thinking and being thought of are different, in relation to which of the two is the Good inherent in thought?
- HoP 2",129
5675,"For the Notion92 of thinking and that of the object of thought are not the same
- HoP 2",87
5676,"Or, in the case of some things, does the science itself constitute that which is the object of science?
- HoP 2",111
5677,"In what is practical the thing is the immaterial substance and the determination of the end (ἡ οὐσία καὶ τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι), and in what is theoretical it is the reason and the thinking
- HoP 2",190
5679,"But the Good is not in this or that part, for it is the best in the universe, as distinguished from it
- HoP 2",110
5680,"In this way the Thought which is its own object subsists to all eternity”  As this speculative Idea, which is the best and most free, is also to be seen in nature, and not only in thinking reason, Aristotle (Metaph
- HoP 2",222
5681,"God, as living God, is the universe; and thus in the universe God, as living God, shows Himself forth
- HoP 2",109
5682,"He comes forth as manifesting Himself or as causing motion, and it is in manifestation alone that the difference between the cause of motion and that which is moved comes to pass
- HoP 2",186
5683,"Regarding the organization of the universe in general, Aristotle says (Metaph
- HoP 2",85
5684,"For the good condition of an army depends upon the order enforced, as much as on the general, and the general is the cause of the army’s good condition in all the greater degree from the fact of the order being through him, and not from his being through the order
- HoP 2",272
5685,"All things are co-ordinated in a certain way, but not all in the same way: take, for example, animals which swim, and those which fly, and plants; they are not so constituted that one of them is not related to another, but they stand in mutual relations
- HoP 2",261
5686,"For all are co-ordinated into one system just as in a house it is by no means permitted to the free inmates to do freely whatever they like, but all that they do, or the most of it, is done according to orderly arrangement
- HoP 2",230
5687,"By slaves and animals, on the contrary, little is done for the general good, but they do much that is casual
- HoP 2",116
5688,"For the principle of each is his own nature
- HoP 2",51
5689,"Amongst the special sciences treated by Aristotle, the Physics is contained in a whole series of physical treatises, which form a tolerably complete system of what constitutes the Philosophy of Nature in its whole extent
- HoP 2",228
5690,"We shall try to give their general plan
- HoP 2",47
5691,"Aristotle’s first work is his Treatise, in eight books, on Physics, or on the Principles (φυσικὴ ἀκρόασις ἢ περὶ ἀρχῶν)
- HoP 2",127
5692,"In this he deals, as is fitting, with the doctrine of the Notion of nature generally, with movement, and with space and time
- HoP 2",132
5693,"The first manifestation of absolute substance is movement, and its moments are space and time; this conception of its manifestation is the universal, which realizes itself first in the corporeal world, passing into the principle of separation
- HoP 2",250
5694,"Aristotle’s Physics is what for present physicists would, properly speaking, be the Metaphysics of Nature; for our physicists only say what they have seen, what delicate and excellent instruments they have made, and not what they have thought
- HoP 2",250
5696,"Then follow the treatises on Production and Destruction, the physical process of change, while formerly the ideal process of movement was considered
- HoP 2",156
5698,"Then comes the Meteorology; it represents the universal physical process in its most real forms
- HoP 2",103
5699,"Here particular determinations appear, such as rain, the saltness of the sea, clouds, dew, hail, snow, hoar-frost, winds, rainbows, boiling, cooking, roasting, colours, &c On certain matters, such as the colours, Aristotle wrote particular treatises
- HoP 2",257
5700,"Nothing is forgotten, and yet the presentation is, on the whole, empiric
- HoP 2",80
5702,"From this point Aristotle proceeds to organic nature, and here his works not only contain a natural history, but also a physiology and anatomy
- HoP 2",150
5703,"To the anatomy pertain his works on the Locomotion of Animals, and on the Parts of Animals
- HoP 2",98
5704,"Finally, there comes the History of Animals, not merely as a history of Nature, but also as the history of the animal in its entirety—what we may call a kind of physiologico-anatomical anatomy
- HoP 2",200
5705,"There is likewise a botanical work On Plants (περὶ φυτῶν) which is ascribed to him
- HoP 2",90
5706,"Thus we here find natural philosophy in the whole extent of its outward content
- HoP 2",87
5707,"As regards this plan, there is no question that this is not the necessary order in which natural philosophy or physics must be treated
- HoP 2",142
5708,"It is long since physics adopted in its conception the form and tendency derived from Aristotle, of deducing the parts of the science from the whole; and thus even what is not speculative still retains this connection as far as outward order goes
- HoP 2",254
5711,"They can certainly not dispense with the Notion, but through a kind of tacit agreement they allow certain conceptions, such as forces, subsistence in parts, &c, to be valid, and make use of these without in the least knowing whether they have truth and how they have truth
- HoP 2",280
5712,"But in regard to the content they express no better the truth of things, but only the sensuous manifestation
- HoP 2",116
5713,"Aristotle and the ancients understand by physics, on the other hand, the comprehension of nature—the universal; and for this reason Aristotle also calls it the doctrine of principles
- HoP 2",190
5714,"For in the manifestation of nature this distinction between the principle and what follows it, manifestation, really commences, and it is abrogated only in genuine speculation
- HoP 2",183
5715,"Yet if, on the one hand, what is physical in Aristotle is mainly philosophic and not experimental, he yet proceeded in his Physics in what may be called an empiric way
- HoP 2",175
5716,"Thus, as it has been already remarked of the Aristotelian philosophy in general that the different parts fall into a series of independently determined conceptions, so we find that this is the case here also; hence an account can only be given of a part of them
- HoP 2",269
5717,"One part is not universal enough to embrace the other part, for each is independent
- HoP 2",91
5718,"But that which follows, and which has in great measure reference to what is individual, no longer comes under the dominion of the Notion, but becomes a superficial suggestion of reasons, and an explanation from the proximate causes, such as we find in our physics
- HoP 2",271
5719,"In regard to the general conception of nature, we must say that Aristotle represents it in the highest and truest manner
- HoP 2",128
5720,"For in the Idea of nature Aristotle (Phys
- HoP 2",49
5721,"Aristotle at once grasps the whole matter in its principles, and this constitutes the old contradiction and divergence of view existing between necessity (causæ efficientes) and end (causæ finales), which we have inherited
- HoP 2",230
5722,"The first mode of consideration is that in accordance with external necessity, which is the same as chance—the conception that all that pertains to nature is determined from without by means of natural causes
- HoP 2",216
5723,"The other mode of consideration is the teleological, but conformity to end is either inward or outward, and in the more recent culture the latter has long retained the supremacy
- HoP 2",185
5724,"Thus men vibrate in their opinion between these two points of view, seek external causes, and war against the form of an external teleology which places the end outside of nature
- HoP 2",186
5725,"These determinations were known to Aristotle, and he thoroughly investigates them and considers what they are and mean
- HoP 2",126
5726,"Aristotle’s conception of nature is, however, nobler than that of to-day, for with him the principal point is the determination of end as the inward determinateness of natural things
- HoP 2",190
5728,"In this doctrine Aristotle has before his eyes the inward immanent end, to which he considers necessity an external condition
- HoP 2",133
5730,"In nature we usually think of necessity first, and understand as the essentially natural that which is not determined through end
- HoP 2",137
5731,"For long men thought that they determined nature both philosophically and truly in limiting it to necessity
- HoP 2",115
5732,"But the aspect of nature has had a stigma removed from it, because, by means of its conformity to the end in view, it is elevated above the commonplace
- HoP 2",159
5733,"The two moments which we have considered in substance, the active form and matter, correspond with these two determinations
- HoP 2",131
5734,"We must first consider the conception of adaptation to end as the ideal moment in substance
- HoP 2",99
5735,"Aristotle begins (Phys
- HoP 2",30
5736,"The vapour driven upwards cools, and the water resulting from this cooling falls as rain, and it happens that the corn is thereby made to grow
- HoP 2",150
5738,"That, for example, the front teeth are sharp and adapted for dividing, and that the back teeth, on the contrary, are broad and adapted for grinding the food in pieces, may be an accidental circumstance, not necessarily brought about for these particular ends
- HoP 2",266
5740,"Thus we also require to use the expression development (an unthinking evolution), in our present-day natural philosophy
- HoP 2",127
5741,"The conception that the first productions were, so to speak, attempts, of which those which did not show themselves to be suitable could not endure, is easily arrived at by natural philosophy
- HoP 2",199
5742,"But nature, as entelecheia or realization, is what brings forth itself
- HoP 2",78
5743,"Aristotle hence replies: “It is impossible to believe this
- HoP 2",66
5744,"For what is produced in accordance with nature is always, or at least for the most part, produced” (external universality as the constant recurrence of what has passed away), “but this is not so with what happens through fortune or through chance
- HoP 2",254
5746,"Leaves, blossoms, roots thus bring the plant into evidence and go back into it; and that which they bring to pass is already present in the seed from which they took their origin
- HoP 2",186
5748,"But the self-maintaining activity of life really brings forth this unity in all relationships
- HoP 2",101
5749,"What has here been said is already contained in that which was asserted by those who do not represent nature in this way, but say, “that which is constituted as though it were constituted for an end, will endure” For this is the self-productive action of nature
- HoP 2",269
5751,"In the Kantian philosophy we for the first time have that conception once more awakened in us, for organic nature at least; life has there been made an end to itself
- HoP 2",173
5753,"The fact that most recent times have brought back the rational view of the matter into our remembrance, is thus none else than a justification of the Aristotelian Idea
- HoP 2",175
5754,"Aristotle also speaks of the end which is represented by organic nature in itself, in relation to the means, of which he says (Phys
- HoP 2",139
5756,"However much we may, in the modern way of regarding things, struggle against the idea of an immanent end, from reluctance to accept it, we must, in the case of animals and plants, acknowledge such a conception, always re-establishing itself in another
- HoP 2",259
5757,"For example, because the animal lives in water or in air, it is so constructed that it can maintain its existence in air or water; thus it requires water to explain the gills of fishes; and, on the other hand, because the animal is so constructed, it lives in water
- HoP 2",273
5758,"This activity in transformation thus does not depend in a contingent way on life; it is aroused through the outward powers, but only in as far as conformity with the soul of the animal permits
- HoP 2",200
5759,"In passing, Aristotle here (Phys
- HoP 2",40
5760,"Its errors are monstrosities and deformities, which, however, are only the errors of that which operates for an end
- HoP 2",123
5761,"In the production of animals and plants, an animal is not at first produced, but the seed, and even in it corruption is possible” For the seed is the mean, as being the not as yet established, independent, indifferent, free actuality
- HoP 2",241
5762,"In this comparison of nature with art we ordinarily have before us the external adaptation to end, the teleological point of view, the making for definite ends
- HoP 2",167
5764,"If the form of a ship were the particular inward principle of the timber, it would act as nature prompted
- HoP 2",113
5766,"As Aristotle has hitherto combated an external teleology, he directs another equally applicable remark (Phys
- HoP 2",116
5768,"The same takes place in everything which has an end in itself; for it is not without that which is necessary to its nature, and yet it is not on account of this, unless the matter so demands, but on account of an end
- HoP 2",224
5769,"Hence the necessary is from hypothesis only, and not as end, for necessity is in matter, but end is in reason (λόγῳ)
- HoP 2",124
5771,"The principle of matter is thus turned into the truly active ground of end, which means the overthrow of necessity, so that that which is natural shall maintain itself in the end
- HoP 2",186
5772,"Necessity is the objective manifestation of the action of its moments as separated, just as in chemistry the essential reality of both the extremes—the base and the acid—is the necessity of their relation
- HoP 2",212
5773,"This is the main conception of Aristotelian Physics
- HoP 2",59
5774,"Its further development concerns the conceptions of the different objects of nature, a material for speculative philosophy which we have spoken of above (pp
- HoP 2",164
5775,"Thus he at first (Phys
- HoP 2",30
5778,"But Aristotle distinguishes from this what falls under the form of this opposition, “That moving is also moved which has movement as a capacity, and whose immobility is rest
- HoP 2",181
5779,"That in which movement is present has immobility as rest; for activity in rest, as such, is movement” That is to say, rest is capacity for motion
- HoP 2",153
5780,"But that which moves always introduces a certain form or end (εἶδος), either this particular thing (τόδε), or a quality or a quantity, which is the principle and cause of the motion when it moves; thus man, as he is in energy, makes man from man as he is in capacity
- HoP 2",274
5781,"Thus, too, it is evident that movement is in the movable thing: for it is the activity of this, and is derived from that which is motive
- HoP 2",144
5782,"The activity of that which is motive is likewise not different, for both are necessarily activity
- HoP 2",105
5783,"It is motive because it has the capacity for being so; but it causes motion because it energizes
- HoP 2",104
5785,"Activity and passivity are not originally (κυρίως) the same, but in what they are inherent, in motion, they are the same
- HoP 2",128
5786,"In Being (τῷ εἶναι) they are identical, but activity, in so far as it is activity of this in this” (what is moved), “and the activity of this from this” (what moves), “is different as regards its conception (τῷ λόγῳ)” Aristotle subsequently deals with the infinite (Phys
- HoP 2",278
5787,"It cannot be a body, for then there would be in one and the same, two bodies
- HoP 2",84
5789,"It is not an element, and neither consists of corporeal nor of incorporeal elements, for it possesses magnitude, but not body
- HoP 2",133
5790,"The elements of bodies are, however, themselves bodies, and no magnitude is produced from intelligible elements
- HoP 2",119
5792,"The uttermost ends of what comprehends and of what is comprehended are identical, for both are bounds; but they are not bounds of the same, for form is the boundary of the thing, place is that of the embracing body
- HoP 2",222
5793,"Place, as the comprehending, remains unchangeably passive while the thing which is moved is moved away; from which we see that place must be separable from the thing
- HoP 2",173
5794,"Or place, according to Aristotle, is the boundary, the negation of a body, the assertion of difference, of discretion; but it likewise does not merely belong to this body, but also to that which comprehends
- HoP 2",214
5795,"There is thus no difference at all, but unchangeable continuity
- HoP 2",71
5796,"But the whole heavens are not anywhere, since no body comprehends them
- HoP 2",78
5797,"Outside the universe nothing is, and hence everything is in the heavens, for the heavens are the whole
- HoP 2",110
5798,"Place, however, is not the heavens, but its external quiescent boundary which touches the body moved
- HoP 2",108
5799,"Hence the earth is in water, water in air, air in ether, but ether in the heavens”  From this point Aristotle goes on (Phys
- HoP 2",131
5800,"The conception of a vacuum has its justification for one thing in the fact that a vacuum,” the negative to an existent form, “is essential to motion; for a body could not move in a plenum,” and in the place to which it does move there must be nothing
- HoP 2",258
5801,"Aristotle confutes these reasonings most adroitly, and first of all in this way; “The plenum could be changed, and bodies could yield to one another even if no interval of vacuum separated them
- HoP 2",201
5802,"Liquids as well as solids are not condensed into a vacuum; something that they contained is expelled, just as air is expelled if water is compressed”  Aristotle deals more thoroughly, in the first place (Phys
- HoP 2",216
5803,"For, on the one hand, he shows that the vacuum really abolishes motion, and consequently in vacuum a universal rest would reign
- HoP 2",135
5804,"He calls it perfect indifference as to the greater or less distance to which a thing is moved; in vacuum there are no distinctions
- HoP 2",138
5805,"It is pure negation without object or difference; there is no reason for standing still or going on
- HoP 2",107
5806,"But body is in movement, and that, indeed, as distinguished; it has a positive relation, and not one merely to nothing
- HoP 2",126
5807,"On the other hand, Aristotle refutes the idea that movement is in vacuum because compression is possible
- HoP 2",112
5808,"But this does not happen in a vacuum; there would be established in it not one movement, but a movement towards all sides, a general annihilation, an absolute yielding, where no cohesion would remain in the body
- HoP 2",219
5809,"The difference in velocity is in inverse ratio to the specific gravity of the medium, air and water, so that if the medium has only half the density, the rate of progress will be double as quick
- HoP 2",202
5810,"But vacuum has to body no such relation of differences of specific gravity
- HoP 2",82
5811,"Body can no more contain a vacuum within its dimensions than a line can contain a point, unless the line were composed of points
- HoP 2",136
5813,"The conception of equal movement of the heavy and the light, as that of pure weight, pure matter, is an abstraction, being taken as though they were inherently like, only differing through the accidental resistance of the air
- HoP 2",233
5814,"Now if, as they say, the less dense were that which has many separate void spaces, it is evident that since a vacuum cannot be separated any more than a space can have intervals, neither can the rare subsist in this manner
- HoP 2",230
5815,"But if it is not separable, and yet a vacuum is said to exist in the body, in the first place movement could thus only be upwards; for the rare is the light, and hence they say that fire is rare,” because it always moves upwards
- HoP 2",236
5816,"But how is it possible that a vacuum can move, or that there can be a place where there is a vacuum?
- HoP 2",108
5817,"For that into which it is carried would be the vacuum of a vacuum
- HoP 2",73
5819,"And again, the matter of a small body and a large is the same, because at one time a greater proceeds from a smaller, and at another time a smaller from a greater
- HoP 2",170
5820,"If air is generated from water it is expanded, but the matter remains the same and without taking to itself anything else; for that which it was in capacity it becomes in actuality
- HoP 2",188
5822,"This is very different from the physical conceptions which assert more or less matter to correspond with more or less density, thus comprehending the difference in specific weight as the external addition of matter
- HoP 2",222
5823,"Aristotle, on the contrary, takes this dynamically, though certainly not in the sense in which dynamics are to-day understood, viz as an increase of intensity or as a degree, for he accepts intensity in its truth as universal capacity
- HoP 2",242
5824,"Undoubtedly the difference must also be taken as a difference in amount, but not as an increase and decrease, or as an alteration in the absolute quantity of the matter
- HoP 2",176
5825,"For here intensity means force, but again not as being a thing of thought separated from matter, but as indicating that if anything has become more intensive, it has had its actuality diminished, having, however, according to Aristotle, attained to a greater capacity
- HoP 2",275
5826,"If the intensity is again directed outwards, and compared with other things, it undoubtedly becomes degree, and therefore magnitude immediately enters in
- HoP 2",161
5827,"It then is indifferent whether greater intension or greater extension is posited; more air is capable of being warmed to the same degree as less, through the greater intensity of the warmth; or the same air can thereby become intensively warmer
- HoP 2",252
5828,"As regards the investigation of time, Aristotle remarks (Phys
- HoP 2",69
5829,"But it now appears that time, if composed of things that are not, may be incapable of existence
- HoP 2",103
5830,"And also as regards everything divisible, if it exists, either some or all of its parts must be
- HoP 2",103
5831,"Time is certainly divisible; but some of the parts are past, others are future, and no part is present
- HoP 2",110
5832,"For the now is no part, since a part has a measure, and the whole must consist of the parts; but time does not appear to consist of the Now” That is to say, because the Now is indivisible, it has no quantitative determination which could be measured
- HoP 2",257
5833,"Again, time is not a movement and change, for movement and change occur in that which is moved and changed, or accompany time in its course; but time is everywhere alike
- HoP 2",177
5834,"Besides change is swifter and slower, but time is not
- HoP 2",61
5835,"But it is not without change and motion” (which is just the moment of pure negativity in the same) “for when we perceive no change, it appears as if no time had elapsed, as in sleep
- HoP 2",189
5837,"Now when we understand that the extremes of the conclusion are different from the middle, and the soul says that the Now has two instants, the one prior and the other posterior, then we say that this is time
- HoP 2",215
5838,"What is determined through the Now, we call time, and this is the fundamental principle
- HoP 2",95
5839,"But when we are sensible of the Now as one, and not as a prior and posterior in motion, nor as the identity of an earlier or later, then there does not appear to us to have been any time, because neither was there any motion” Tedium is thus ever the same
- HoP 2",262
5840,"We judge of the more or less through number, but of a greater or less motion by time
- HoP 2",92
5841,"But we call number that which can be numbered, as well as that with which we number; but time is not the number with which we number, but that which is numbered, and, like motion, always is changing
- HoP 2",206
5842,"The Now is, which is the unity of number, and it measures time
- HoP 2",70
5843,"The whole of time is the same, for the Now which was is the same” (universality as the Now destroyed) “but in Being it is another
- HoP 2",137
5844,"Time thus is through the Now both continuous (συνεχής) and discrete (διῇρηται)
- HoP 2",86
5845,"It thereby resembles the point, for that also is the continuity of the line and its division, its principle and limit; but the Now is not an enduring point
- HoP 2",163
5846,"As continuity of time the Now connects the past and the future, but it likewise divides time in capacity,” the Now is only divisibility and the moments only ideal
- HoP 2",170
5847,"Similarly, in as far as we divide the line, other and yet other points always arise for thought; but in as far as it is one, there is only one point
- HoP 2",156
5848,"Thus the Now is both the division of time in capacity, and the limit and union of both” ie of the prior and posterior
- HoP 2",125
5849,"The universally dividing point is only one as actual; but this actual is not permanently one, but ever and again another, so that individuality has universality, as its negativity, within it
- HoP 2",198
5850,"Thus the identity of the understanding is not a principle with Aristotle, for identity and non-identity to him are one and the same
- HoP 2",139
5851,"Because the Now is only now, past and future are different from it, but they are likewise necessarily connected in the Now, which is not without before and after; thus they are in one, and the Now, as their limit, is both their union and their division
- HoP 2",260
5852,"V 1) then goes on to movement as realized in a thing, to change (μεταβολή) or to the physical processes—while before we had pure movement
- HoP 2",145
5853,"The motion is in the wood and not in the form; for neither form nor place, nor quantity moves or is moved, but” (in the order in which they follow) “there is that which is moved and that which moves, and that into which it is moved
- HoP 2",239
5854,"That to which movement is made, more than that out of which movement is made, is named change
- HoP 2",101
5857,"This opposition of the materialized motion as mutation, and of merely formal motion, is noteworthy
- HoP 2",106
5858,"In the sixth book Aristotle comes to the consideration of the dialectic of this motion and change as advanced by Zeno, that is, to the endless divisibility which we have already (Vol
- HoP 2",190
5859,"Aristotle solves it through the universal
- HoP 2",49
5861,"Of the further details into which Aristotle enters, I shall only give the following
- HoP 2",91
5862,"As against atoms and their motion, he remarks (Phys
- HoP 2",59
5863,"For as Zeno argues from the indivisibility of atoms against motion, Aristotle argues from motion against atoms
- HoP 2",118
5864,"The atom, as simple indivisible Being, can, however, not have any part of it in both points in space, because it then would be divisible
- HoP 2",144
5865,"The indivisible could thus only move if time consisted of the Now; this is, however, impossible, as we proved before” Because atoms thus neither have change in themselves, nor can this come to them from without through impulse, &c, they are really without truth
- HoP 2",269
5866,"The determination of the pure ideality of change is important
- HoP 2",69
5867,"Aristotle says of this (Phys
- HoP 2",36
5868,"Virtue is the perfection (τελείωσις) in which something has reached the end of its nature
- HoP 2",97
5869,"Vice, however, is the corruption and non-attainment of this
- HoP 2",67
5870,"They are not changes, for they only arise and pass away while another alters” Or the difference becomes a difference of Being and non-being, ie a merely sensuous difference
- HoP 2",180
5871,"From these conceptions Aristotle now comes nearer to the first real or physical motion (Phys
- HoP 2",100
5872,"An endless motion in a straight line is an empty creation of thought; for motion is necessarily an effort after something
- HoP 2",129
5873,"The absolute motion is the circular, because it is without opposition
- HoP 2",77
5874,"For because movement has to be considered in regard to the starting-place and the end in view, in the straight movement the directions from A to B and from B to A are opposed, but in motion in a circle they are the same
- HoP 2",227
5875,"The idea that heavenly bodies would of themselves have moved in a straight line, but that they accidentally came into the sphere of solar attraction, is an empty reflection which is far from occurring to Aristotle
- HoP 2",221
5876,"For when they assert a vacuum before the beginning of generation, this is the quiescent, self-identical, ie the eternal matter, which is thus already established before origination; they will not allow that before origination nothing exists
- HoP 2",248
5877,"But in fact a thing does not exist before its origination, ie in movement there is something to move, and where reality is, there is motion
- HoP 2",147
5878,"They do not, however, bring together that vacuum, the self-identical, the un-originated matter and this nothing
- HoP 2",119
5880,"In the first case they would have sprung from the vacuum, for the vacuum is the immediate incorporeal; but in that case the vacuum must have existed independently as that in which determinate corporeality arose
- HoP 2",218
5881,"But neither do the elements arise from a corporeal, for else this body itself would be a corporeal element before the elements
- HoP 2",134
5882,"Thus it only remains that the elements must spring from one another
- HoP 2",75
5883,"Regarding this we must remark that Aristotle understands by origination, actual origination—not the transition from the universal to the individual, but the origination of one determinate corporeal, not from its principle, but from the opposite as such
- HoP 2",260
5884,"Aristotle does not consider the universal as it contains the negative within it; else the universal would be the absolute matter whose universality, as negativity, is set forth, or is real

5885,"I-5) to a kind of deduction of the elements, which is noteworthy
- HoP 2",72
5886,"He shows that there must be four of them, in the following way—because he starts from the fundamental conceptions of weight and of lightness, or what we should call attraction and centrifugal force
- HoP 2",205
5887,"The corporeal, he says, in its motion is neither light nor heavy, and, indeed, it is not only relative but also absolute
- HoP 2",128
5888,"The relatively light and heavy is what, while equal in volume, descends more slowly or quickly
- HoP 2",102
5889,"Absolute lightness goes up to the extremity of the heavens, absolute weight down into the middle
- HoP 2",104
5890,"These extremes are fire and earth
- HoP 2",41
5891,"Between these there are mediums, other than they, which relate to one another like them; and these are air and water, the one of which has weight, and the other lightness, but only relatively
- HoP 2",199
5892,"For water is suspended under everything except earth, and air over everything except fire
- HoP 2",97
5893,"But any such simple determination of Being is an abstraction and has no reality, because such existence would be capable of no motion and change; the element must itself have reality, and it thus is, as the union of opposites, resolvable
- HoP 2",245
5894,"Aristotle hence makes the elements, as we have already seen with those who went before (Vol
- HoP 2",99
5895,"Hence men are wonderfully discerning in reproaching us for calling water, air, &c, elements!
- HoP 2",100
5897,"But however removed Aristotle may be from understanding simplicity as an abstraction, just as little does he recognize here the arid conception of consisting of parts
- HoP 2",174
5898,"Quite the contrary
- HoP 2",26
5899,"He strives enough against this, as, for instance, in relation to Anaxagoras (De C\nl
- HoP 2",92
5900,"I shall further mention the moments of the real process in relation to motion, in which Aristotle finally passes on (De gen et corr
- HoP 2",139
5901,"Aristotle excludes the relations which concern sight, smell, &c, and brings forward the others as being those which are of sensible weight or lightness
- HoP 2",159
5902,"He gives as these fundamental principles—warmth and cold, dryness and moisture; they are the sensible differences for others, while weight and lightness are different for themselves
- HoP 2",189
5905,"All elements have a mutual opposite; each is as non-being to the Being of the other, and one is thus distinguished from the other as actuality and capacity
- HoP 2",163
5906,"Now amongst these some have an equal part in common; fire and water, for example, have warmth; thus if in fire dryness were overcome by moisture, out of fire air would arise
- HoP 2",181
5907,"On the contrary, as regards those which have nothing in common with one another, like earth, which is cold and dry, and air, which is warm and moist, the transition goes more slowly forward
- HoP 2",197
5908,"The transition of all elements into one another, the whole process of nature, is thus to Aristotle the constant rotation of their changes
- HoP 2",145
5909,"This is unsatisfactory, because neither are the individual elements comprehended nor is the remainder rounded into a whole
- HoP 2",130
5910,"As a matter of fact, Aristotle now goes on, in meteorology, to the consideration of the universal process of nature
- HoP 2",123
5911,"But here we have reached his limits
- HoP 2",43
5912,"Here, in the natural process, the simple determination as such—this system of progressive determination—ceases to hold good, and its whole interest is lost
- HoP 2",163
5913,"For it is in the real process that these determinate conceptions always lose their signification again and become their opposite, and in it also this contingent succession is forced together and united
- HoP 2",209
5915,"But still more must the following moments, moisture, warmth, &c, themselves come back under the conception of process
- HoP 2",125
5916,"But the sensuous manifestation here begins to obtain the upper hand; for the empirical has the nature of the isolated form, which is to fall out of relation
- HoP 2",164
5918,"As regards the other side from the Philosophy of Nature, the Philosophy of Mind, we find that Aristotle has constituted in it also a separation into special sciences, in a series of works which I shall name
- HoP 2",214
5920,"The manner of treatment is almost invariably speculative, and sound understanding is displayed throughout
- HoP 2",113
5922,"In Aristotle’s teaching on this subject we must not expect to find so-called metaphysics of the soul
- HoP 2",108
5923,"For metaphysical handling such as this really pre-supposes the soul as a thing, and asks, for example, what sort of a thing it is, whether it is simple, and so on
- HoP 2",170
5925,"According to the one view, anger, for instance, is looked on as an eager desire for retaliation or the like; according to the other view it is the surging upward of the heart-blood and the warm element in man
- HoP 2",216
5927,"But it is evident that here it is to be regarded as the former of these
- HoP 2",79
5928,"For the soul is present with us both when we sleep and when we wake; waking corresponds with active observation, and sleep with possession and passivity
- HoP 2",160
5929,"But knowledge is in origination prior to all else
- HoP 2",57
5930,"The soul is thus the first energy of a physical but organic body” It is in respect of this that Aristotle gives to the soul the definition of being the entelechy (supra, pp
- HoP 2",180
5931,"In the same chapter Aristotle comes to the question of the mutual relation of body and soul
- HoP 2",99
5932,"For though unity and Being are used in various senses
- HoP 2",61
5935,"The only question that now arises is whether activity and the organ it employs are one; and our idea is to answer in the affirmative
- HoP 2",140
5936,"The more definite explanation of this relation is to be found in the following; “The soul is substance, but only according to the Notion (κατὰ τὸν λόγον); but that is the substantial form (τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι)96 for such and such a body
- HoP 2",239
5937,"For suppose that an instrument, such as an axe, were a natural body, this form, this axehood, would be its substance, and this its form would be its soul, for if this were to be taken away from it, it would no longer be an axe, the name only would remain
- HoP 2",262
5939,"Aristotle answers: Are the nerves, humours, tissues, its substance?
- HoP 2",75
5940,"On the contrary, sight itself is its substance, these material substances are only an empty name
- HoP 2",104
5941,"The potentiality of life is not in any such thing as has lost its soul, but in that which still possesses it
- HoP 2",116
5942,"The seed or the fruit is such and such a body potentially
- HoP 2",65
5943,"Like hewing and seeing,” in the axe and the eye, “waking” in general “is activity; but the corporeal is only potentiality
- HoP 2",129
5944,"But as the” living “eye is both vision and the eyeball” (the two being connected as actuality and potentiality), “so also are soul and body the living animal, the two are not to be separated
- HoP 2",198
5945,"But it is not yet clear whether the soul is the activity of the body in the same way as the steersman is of the ship” That the active form is the true substance, while matter is so only potentially, is a true speculative Notion
- HoP 2",235
5946,"For substance is to all objects the cause of their existence, but life is the existence of the living, and its cause and principle is the soul; and further, its energy is the existing Notion of what has potential existence
- HoP 2",230
5947,"The soul is cause also as end,” that is, as self-determining universality, “for nature, like thought, acts for the sake of an object, which object is its end, but in living beings this is soul
- HoP 2",200
5948,"All the parts of the body are thus the organs of the soul, and hence exist for its sake” In like manner Aristotle shows that the soul is the cause of motion
- HoP 2",164
5949,"The nutrient soul, when it is alone, belongs to plants; when it is at the same time capable of sense-perception, it is the animal soul; and when at once nutrient, sensitive and intelligent, it is the mind of man
- HoP 2",219
5950,"Man has thus three natures united in himself; a thought which is also expressed in modern Natural Philosophy by saying that a man is also both an animal and a plant, and which is directed against the division and separation of the differences in these forms
- HoP 2",265
5951,"That difference has also been revived in recent times in the observation of the organic, and it is highly important to keep these sides separate
- HoP 2",152
5952,"The only question (and it is Aristotle who raises it) is how far these, as parts, are separable
- HoP 2",103
5954,"This is a profound observation, by means of which truly speculative thought marks itself out from the thought which is merely logical and formal
- HoP 2",152
5955,"Similarly among figures only the triangle and the other definite figures, like the square, the parallelogram, &c, are truly anything; for what is common to them, the universal figure, is an empty thing of thought, a mere abstraction
- HoP 2",240
5956,"On the other hand, the triangle is the first, the truly universal figure, which appears also in the square, &c, as the figure which can be led back to the simplest determination
- HoP 2",185
5957,"Therefore, on the one hand, the triangle stands alongside of the square, pentagon, &c, as a particular figure, but—and this is Aristotle’s main contention—it is the truly universal figure
- HoP 2",195
5960,"We can determine these expressions even more particularly
- HoP 2",65
5961,"For if we speak of soul and body, we term the corporeal the objective and the soul the subjective; and the misfortune of nature is just this, that it is objective, that is, it is the Notion only implicitly, and not explicitly
- HoP 2",233
5962,"In the natural there is, no doubt, a certain activity, but again this whole sphere is only the objective, the implicit element in one higher
- HoP 2",148
5963,"As, moreover, the implicit in its sphere appears as a reality for the development of the Idea, it has two sides; the universal is already itself an actual, as, for example, the vegetative soul
- HoP 2",200
5964,"Aristotle’s meaning is therefore this: an empty universal is that which does not itself exist, or is not itself species
- HoP 2",127
5965,"All that is universal is in fact real, as particular, individual, existing for another
- HoP 2",94
5966,"But that universal is real, in that by itself, without further change, it constitutes its first species, and when further developed it belongs, not to this, but to a higher stage
- HoP 2",186
5967,"These are the general determinations which are of the greatest importance, and which, if developed, would lead to all true views of the organic, &c, since they give a correct general representation of the principle of realization
- HoP 2",237
5968,"Sense-perception is in general a potentiality (we should say a receptivity), but this potentiality is also activity; it is therefore not to be conceived as mere passivity
- HoP 2",178
5969,"Passivity and activity pertain to one and the same, or passivity has two senses
- HoP 2",87
5970,"From this Aristotle concludes: “There is one change which is privative; and another which acts on the nature and the permanent energy (ἕξις)
- HoP 2",148
5972,"But the difference is, that what causes the perception is external
- HoP 2",74
5973,"The cause of this is that perceptive activity is directed on the particular, while knowledge has as its object the universal; but the universal is, to a certain extent, in the soul itself as its substance
- HoP 2",212
5975,"This is doubtless the correct point from which to view perception, whatever be the manner of further development preferred, subjective idealism, or any other way
- HoP 2",169
5976,"For it is a matter of perfect indifference whether we find ourselves subjectively or objectively determined; in both there is contained the moment of passivity, by which the perception comes to pass
- HoP 2",206
5977,"The monad of Leibnitz appears, it is true, to be an idea opposed to this, since every monad, every point of my finger, as atom or individual, is an entire universe, the whole of which develops in itself without reference to other monads
- HoP 2",244
5978,"Here seems to be asserted the highest idealistic freedom, but it is of no avail to imagine that all in me develops out of me; for we must always recollect that what is thus developed in me is passive, and not free
- HoP 2",221
5979,"With this moment of passivity Aristotle does not fall short of idealism; sensation is always in one aspect passive
- HoP 2",122
5980,"That is, however, a false idealism which thinks that the passivity and spontaneity of the mind depend on whether the determination given is from within or from without, as if there were freedom in sense-perception, whereas it is itself a sphere of limitation
- HoP 2",266
5981,"It is one thing when the matter—whether it be sensation, light, colour, seeing or hearing—is apprehended from the Idea, for it is then shown that it comes to pass from the self-determination of the Idea
- HoP 2",210
5982,"But it is different when, in so far as I exist as an individual subject, the Idea exists in me as this particular individual; there we have the standpoint of finitude established, and therefore of passivity
- HoP 2",214
5984,"The individual element in sensation is the sphere of the individuality of consciousness; it is present therein in the form of one thing as much as of another, and its individuality consists in this fact, that other things exist for it
- HoP 2",242
5985,"Aristotle continues: “Speaking generally, the difference is that potentiality is twofold; as we say a boy may become a general, and a grown man may also become so,” for the latter has the effective power
- HoP 2",211
5987,"Sense-perception, as made like to itself, has, while appearing to be brought to pass by means of an influence working on it, brought to pass the identity of itself and its object
- HoP 2",186
5990,"The case is different with us in our practical relations, where the influence working upon us pre-supposes in return the contact of the material, for which reason, as Aristotle asserts, plants do not perceive (supra, p 186)
- HoP 2",231
5991,"On the other hand, in receiving form, the material is lost sight of; for the receiving of form indicates no positive relation to the matter, which is no longer something offering resistance
- HoP 2",197
5993,"Thus it is said that all sense-perceptions are impressed on the soul by external things, just as the matter of the signet ring works on the matter of the wax; and then we hear it alleged that this is Aristotle’s philosophy
- HoP 2",230
5996,"It does not, however, remain in the same relation to it as that in which the form stands to the wax, nor is it as in chemistry where one element is permeated by another as regards its matter
- HoP 2",198
5997,"The chief circumstance, therefore, and that which constitutes the difference between this illustration and the condition of the soul is altogether overlooked
- HoP 2",165
6000,"The illustration of the wax has reference to nothing but the fact that only the form comes to the soul; and has nothing to do with the form being external to the wax and remaining so, or with the soul having, like wax, no independent form
- HoP 2",246
6001,"The soul is by no means said to be passive wax and to receive its determinations from without; but Aristotle, as we shall soon see (p 194), really says that the spirit repels matter from itself, and maintains itself against it, having relation only to form
- HoP 2",264
6003,"The soul therefore changes the form of the external body into its own, and is identical with an abstract quality such as this, for the sole reason that it itself is this universal form
- HoP 2",192
6004,"Hence, when the object of sense is removed, the perceptions and the images which represent them remain in the organs
- HoP 2",124
6006,"As therefore activity and passivity are manifested in the subject which receives the effect, and not in the object which produces it (ποιοῦντι), the energy both of the object and of the faculty of sense-perception is in the faculty itself
- HoP 2",246
6007,"For hearing and sounding there are two words, for seeing only one; seeing is the activity of the person who sees, but the activity of the colour is without name
- HoP 2",168
6010,"It is upon this difference and this identity that everything depends; and Aristotle demonstrates this in the most emphatic way, and holds firmly to his point
- HoP 2",165
6011,"The later distinction of subjective and objective is the reflection of consciousness; sense-perception is simply the abrogation of this separation, it is that form of identity which abstracts from subjectivity and objectivity
- HoP 2",233
6012,"What is simple, the soul proper or the I, is in sense-perception unity in difference
- HoP 2",92
6013,"It is thus not possible for separate perceptions, white and sweet, to be distinguished as separate indifferent moments, for both must be present (δῆλα) to one subject
- HoP 2",174
6014,"This one subject must therefore determine one thing to be different from another
- HoP 2",88
6015,"This, as distinguished, can also not be in a different place or time, for it must be undivided and in undivided time
- HoP 2",124
6016,"But it is impossible that one and the same thing should be affected by contrary movements, in so far as it is undivided and in undivided time
- HoP 2",149
6017,"If sweetness affects sense-perception in one way, and bitterness in the contrary way, and whiteness in yet another way, the power of judging is numerically not discrete nor divisible, but according to the Notion (τῷ εἶναι)98 it is distinguished
- HoP 2",252
6018,"That which is the same and indivisible thus possesses in potentiality opposite qualities; but with its true existence (τῷ εἶναι) that cannot be the case, for in its activity it is separable, and cannot at the same time be both white and black
- HoP 2",250
6019,"Sense-perception and thinking are like that which some term a point, which, in so far as it is one, is inseparable, and in so far as it is two, is separable
- HoP 2",164
6020,"So far as it is undivided, the judging faculty is one and acts in a single point of time, but so far as it is divided” (not one) “it employs the same sign twice simultaneously
- HoP 2",183
6021,"So far as it employs two, it by limitation distinguishes two, and separates them as having separate origin; but so far as it is one, it judges by one act in one single point of time” (supra, p 172)
- HoP 2",205
6023,"Another example is that of number; one and two are different, and, at the same time, even in two one is used and posited as one
- HoP 2",135
6024,"From sense-perception Aristotle passes on to thought, and becomes here really speculative
- HoP 2",97
6026,"Therefore the nature of the understanding is none other than this potentiality” But potentiality itself is here not matter; that is to say, the understanding has no matter, for potentiality pertains to its very substance
- HoP 2",228
6027,"For thinking is really the not being implicit; and on account of its purity its reality is not the being-for-another, but its potentiality is itself a being-for-self
- HoP 2",173
6028,"A thing is real because it is this determinate thing; the opposite determination, its potentiality to be, for instance, smoke, ashes, and so on, is not posited in it
- HoP 2",173
6029,"In the corporeal, therefore, matter, as potentiality, and external form, as reality, are opposed to one another; but the soul is, in contrast with this, universal potentiality itself, without matter, because its essence is energy
- HoP 2",237
6030,"For what should it be like, warm or cold?
- HoP 2",49
6031,"Or should it be an organ?
- HoP 2",33
6032,"But it is none of these
- HoP 2",31
6033,"That it is, however, different from the faculty of sense-perception is clear
- HoP 2",84
6034,"For sense-perception cannot perceive after a violent perception; for instance, it cannot smell nor see after experiencing strong smells or colours
- HoP 2",154
6035,"But the understanding, after it has thought something which can only be thought with difficulty, will not have more but less difficulty in thinking of something that is easier
- HoP 2",183
6036,"For there is no sense-perception independent of the body, but the understanding is separable from it
- HoP 2",108
6037,"Thinking makes itself into passive understanding, that is, into what is for it the objective; and thus it here becomes plain to what extent the dictum nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu expresses Aristotle’s meaning
- HoP 2",237
6039,"There is a further difficulty, whether understanding can itself be the object of thought
- HoP 2",96
6042,"That is an idealistic way of expressing it; and yet they say that Aristotle is an empiricist
- HoP 2",100
6044,"All Aristotle’s thoughts are overlooked, and only external illustrations such as this are comprehended
- HoP 2",110
6045,"A book on which nothing is written everyone can understand
- HoP 2",66
6047,"Instead of the Notion being adhered to, casual comparisons such as these have been caught up here and there by the imagination, as if they expressed the matter itself
- HoP 2",174
6049,"The analogy is therefore confined to this, that the soul has a content only in so far as actual thought is exercised
- HoP 2",124
6050,"The soul is this book unwritten on, and the meaning consequently is that the soul is all things implicitly, but it is not in itself this totality; it is like a book that contains all things potentially, but in reality contains nothing before it is written on
- HoP 2",266
6051,"Before real activity nothing truly exists; or “Understanding itself can enter thought, like the objects of thought in general
- HoP 2",133
6052,"For in that which is without matter” (in mind), “the thinker” (the subjective) “and the thought” (the objective) “are the same; theoretical knowledge and that which comes to be known are the same
- HoP 2",203
6053,"In that which is material, thinking is only in potentiality, so that understanding itself does not belong to it; for understanding is a potentiality without matter, but the object of thought exists in it,” while Nature contains the Idea only implicitly
- HoP 2",260
6054,"It is plain from this that the above illustration has been taken in quite a false sense, utterly contrary to Aristotle’s meaning
- HoP 2",136
6055,"Until now we have spoken of the passive understanding, which is the nature of the soul, but also in equal degree its faculty of sense-perception and imagination
- HoP 2",168
6056,"It therefore necessarily follows that in the soul also these different elements should be present
- HoP 2",105
6058,"This understanding is absolute (χωριστός), uncompounded, and not influenced from without, as it is essentially activity
- HoP 2",127
6059,"For the active is always more in honour than the passive, and the principle more in honour than the matter that it forms
- HoP 2",128
6061,"Active understanding is not such that it sometimes thinks and sometimes does not
- HoP 2",88
6062,"When it is absolute, it is the one and only existence; and this alone is eternal and immortal
- HoP 2",101
6064,"For existent objects are either perceived by the senses or thought; but knowledge itself is in a manner the object of knowledge, and perception the object of perception
- HoP 2",176
6065,"Knowledge and sense-perception are not the things themselves (the stone is not in the soul), but their form; so that the soul is like the hand
- HoP 2",150
6067,"In this way he who perceives nothing by his senses learns nothing and understands nothing; when he discerns anything (θεωρῇ), he must necessarily discern it as a pictorial conception, for such conceptions are like sense-perceptions, only without matter
- HoP 2",260
6068,"In what way then are our primary ideas distinguished, so as not to be mistaken for conceptions?
- HoP 2",103
6070,"It is only in appearance that thought is spoken of as on a level with what is other than thought; this fashion of bringing what is different into conjunction certainly appears in Aristotle
- HoP 2",196
6071,"But what he says of thought is explicitly and absolutely speculative, and is not on the same level with anything else, such as sense-perception, which has only potentiality for thought
- HoP 2",192
6073,"These are the main points which are to be taken note of in Aristotle with regard to his speculative ideas, which it is impossible for us, however, to treat in greater detail
- HoP 2",181
6074,"We have now to pass on to what follows, which is a practical philosophy, and in doing so we must first establish firmly the conception of desire, which is really the turning round of thought into its negative side, wherein it becomes practical
- HoP 2",251
6075,"For all that comes into being originates from that which operates actively
- HoP 2",82
6076,"The object perceived by sense appears as that which causes the faculty of perception in potentiality to become the faculty of perception in actuality, for the latter is not receptive of influence, and does not undergo change
- HoP 2",232
6078,"All this process may, however, just as well be termed separation
- HoP 2",72
6080,"But desire and aversion are the same in energy; it is only in manifestation that they are different
- HoP 2",107
6081,"To the reasoning soul pictorial conceptions take the place of sense-perceptions, and when the mind affirms or denies something to be good or bad, it desires or avoids its object
- HoP 2",185
6082,"It has the relation both of unity and limit
- HoP 2",51
6085,"But independently of action true and false are of the same character as good or evil”   b
- HoP 2",97
6086,"From this the conception of will, or the practical element is shown to us, and it has to be reckoned as still belonging to the Philosophy of Mind
- HoP 2",153
6087,"Aristotle has treated it in several works which we now possess
- HoP 2",70
6090,"Aristotle103 defines the principle of morality or the highest good, as happiness (εὐδαιμονία), which later on became a much disputed expression
- HoP 2",151
6091,"It is good generally, not as abstract idea, but in such a way that the moment of realization is what actually answers to it
- HoP 2",131
6092,"Aristotle thus does not content himself with the Platonic idea of the good, because it is only general; with him the question is taken in its determinateness
- HoP 2",165
6093,"Aristotle then says that the good is what has its end in itself (τέλειον)
- HoP 2",81
6094,"If we tried to translate τέλειον by “perfect” here, we should translate it badly; it is that which, as having its end (τὸ τέλος) in itself, is not desired for the sake of anything else, but for its own sake (supra, pp
- HoP 2",225
6098,"In regard to the conception of virtue I should like to say something more
- HoP 2",81
6099,"From a practical point of view, Aristotle104 first of all distinguishes in soul a rational and an irrational side; in the latter reason only exists potentially; under it come the feelings, passions and affections
- HoP 2",220
6100,"On the rational side understanding, wisdom, discretion, knowledge, have their place; but they still do not constitute virtue, which first subsists in the unity of the rational and the irrational sides
- HoP 2",208
6101,"When the inclinations are so related to virtue that they carry out its dictates, this, according to Aristotle, is virtue
- HoP 2",128
6102,"Aristotle thus places virtue in knowledge, yet reason is not, as many believe, the principle of virtue purely in itself, for it is rather the rational impulse towards what is good; both desire and reason are thus necessary moments in virtue
- HoP 2",248
6103,"Hence it cannot be said of virtue that it is misemployed, for it itself is the employer
- HoP 2",95
6104,"Thus Aristotle, as we have already seen (Vol
- HoP 2",52
6107,"But then the subject must, in this separation of his activity, bring likewise his passions under the subjection of the universal, and this unity, in which the rational is pre-eminent, is virtue
- HoP 2",201
6110,"Aristotle then passes through the particular virtues at great length
- HoP 2",76
6112,"This does not appear to be a sufficient definition, and it is merely a quantitative determination, just because it is not only the Notion that determines, but the empirical side is also present
- HoP 2",201
6113,"Virtue is not absolutely determined in itself, but likewise has a material element, the nature of which is capable of a more or a less
- HoP 2",142
6114,"Thus if it has been objected to Aristotle’s definition of virtue as a difference in degree, that it is unsatisfactory and vague, we may say that this really is involved in the nature of the thing
- HoP 2",203
6115,"Virtue, and determinate virtue in its entirety, enters into a sphere where that which is quantitative has a place; thought here is no more as such at home with itself, and the quantitative limit undetermined
- HoP 2",215
6117,"It is in practice that man seeks a necessity in man as individual, and endeavours to express it; but it is either formal, or as in particular virtues, a definite content, which, in so being, falls a prey to empiricism
- HoP 2",225
6118,"Aristotle hence also looks on political philosophy as the sum total of practical philosophy, the end of the state as general happiness
- HoP 2",142
6119,"Such is the object of practical science, and this pertains in a measure to politics”107  Aristotle indeed appreciates so highly the state, that he starts at once (Polit
- HoP 2",176
6120,"Hence he alone has a knowledge of good and evil, of justice and injustice, and not the beast,” for the beast does not think, and yet in modern times men rest the distinction which exists in these determinations on sensation, which beasts have equally with men
- HoP 2",267
6121,"There is also the sense of good and evil, &c, and Aristotle knows this aspect as well (supra, p 202); but that through which it is not animal sensation merely, is thought
- HoP 2",178
6122,"Hence rational perception is also to Aristotle the essential condition of virtue, and thus the harmony between the sensational point of view and that of reason is an essential moment in his eudæmonism
- HoP 2",208
6124,"If, for example, you take away the whole body, there is not a foot or hand remaining, excepting in name, and as if anyone should call a hand of stone a hand; for a hand destroyed is like a hand of stone” If the man is dead, all the parts perish
- HoP 2",252
6126,"But with Aristotle, as with Plato, the state is the prius, the substantial, the chief, for its end is the highest in respect of the practical
- HoP 2",149
6130,"It is a divided activity in which each has only his part, just as in a factory no one makes a whole, but only a part, and does not possess skill in other departments, because only a few are employed in fitting the different parts together
- HoP 2",246
6131,"It is free nations alone that have the consciousness of and activity for the whole; in modern times the individual is only free for himself as such, and enjoys citizen freedom alone—in the sense of that of a bourgeois and not of a citoyen
- HoP 2",246
6132,"The freedom of citizens in this signification is the dispensing with universality, the principle of isolation; but it is a necessary moment unknown to ancient states
- HoP 2",173
6133,"It is the perfect independence of the points, and therefore the greater independence of the whole, which constitutes the higher organic life
- HoP 2",148
6134,"After the state received this principle into itself, the higher freedom could come forth
- HoP 2",96
6135,"These other states are sports and products of nature which depend upon chance and upon the caprice of the individual, but now, for the first time, the inward subsistence and indestructible universality, which is real and consolidated in its parts, is rendered possible
- HoP 2",276
6136,"Aristotle for the rest has not tried like Plato to describe such a state, but in respect of the constitution he merely points out that the best must rule
- HoP 2",161
6137,"But this always takes place, let men do as they will, and hence he has not so very much to do with determining the forms of the constitution
- HoP 2",148
6139,"Such a man could perhaps be turned out of the state, but not subjected to control any more than Jupiter

6142,"For hundreds and thousands of years it was just as much honoured as it is despised now
- HoP 2",94
6146,"The forms he gives to us come from Aristotle both in reference to the Notion and to the judgment and conclusion
- HoP 2",119
6148,"Because it is a knowledge and consciousness of the abstract activity of pure understanding, it is not a knowledge of this and that concrete fact, being pure form
- HoP 2",169
6149,"This knowledge is in fact marvellous, and even more marvellous is the manner in which it is constituted: this logic is hence a work which does the greatest honour to the deep thought of its discoverer and to the power of his abstraction
- HoP 2",244
6151,"Aristotle also considers, in fact, not only the movement of thought, but likewise of thought in ordinary conception
- HoP 2",123
6152,"The Logic of Aristotle is contained in five books, which are collected together under the name Ὀργανον
- HoP 2",110
6153,"The Categories (κατηγορίαι), of which the first work treats, are the universal determinations, that which is predicated of existent things (κατηγορεῖται): as well that which we call conceptions of the understanding, as the simple realities of things
- HoP 2",257
6154,"This may be called an ontology, as pertaining to metaphysics; hence these determinations also appear in Aristotle’s Metaphysics
- HoP 2",135
6156,"For Aristotle says, “There are predicates (ὄντα) which can be assigned to a certain subject (καθ̓ ὑποκειμένον), yet are in no subject, as ‘man’ is predicated of ‘some certain man,’ and yet he is no particular man
- HoP 2",220
6158,"Some are predicated of a subject (λέγεται) and are in it; science is in the soul and is predicated of the grammatical art
- HoP 2",129
6160,"We can see that Aristotle has the difference of the genus or universal and the individual present to his mind
- HoP 2",117
6161,"The first thing which Aristotle has indicated in the foregoing is thus the genus, which is predicated of a man, but which is not in him, at least not as a particular quality; the brave man, for example, is an actual, but expressed as a universal conception
- HoP 2",264
6162,"In formal logic and its conceptions and definitions there is always present opposition to an actual; and the logical actual is in itself something thought, bravery thus being, for example, a pure form of abstraction
- HoP 2",223
6163,"This logic of the understanding seeks, however, in its three stages to imitate the categories of the absolute
- HoP 2",117
6164,"The conception or definition is a logical actual, and thus in itself merely something thought, ie possible
- HoP 2",114
6165,"In the judgment this logic calls a conception A the actual subject and connects with it another actual as the conception B; B is said to be the conception and A to be dependent on it—but B is only the more general conception
- HoP 2",232
6167,"The major term expresses logical being and the minor term logical potentiality, for Caius is a mere potentiality for logic; the conclusion unites both
- HoP 2",158
6168,"But it is to reason that life first unfolds itself, for it is true reality
- HoP 2",82
6169,"What comes second in Aristotle is the universal, which is not the genus, ie it is not in itself the unity of universal and particular—nor is it absolute individuality and hence infinitude
- HoP 2",195
6170,"This is the moment or predicate in a subject certainly, but it is not absolutely in and for itself
- HoP 2",106
6171,"This relation is now expressed through οὐ λέγεται; for ὅ λέγεται is that which, as universal in itself, is likewise infinite
- HoP 2",132
6172,"The third is the particular which is predicated: just as science in itself is infinite and thus the genus, eg of the grammatical art; but at the same time as universal, or as not individual, it is the moment of a subject
- HoP 2",228
6173,"The fourth indicated by Aristotle is what is called immediate conception—the individual
- HoP 2",95
6174,"The reservation that something such as a definite grammatical art is also in a subject, has no place here, for the definite grammatical art is not really in itself individual
- HoP 2",182
6175,"For instance, animals are divided into beasts, bird, fishes—but science has no such distinction
- HoP 2",103
6177,"That which is predicated without any connection he treats of more fully as the categories proper, in what follows; yet the work in which these categories are laid down is not to be regarded as complete
- HoP 2",209
6179,"Being, essence, takes the first place in them; next to it is possibility, as accident or what is caused; the two are, however, separated
- HoP 2",144
6180,"A of substance is logical Being; it is its essence opposed to its existence, and this existence is in logic mere potentiality
- HoP 2",133
6181,"In the category of causality the Being of A in B is a mere Being of reflection; B is for itself another
- HoP 2",111
6184,"But of things which are in a subject (ἐν ὑποκειμένῳ ὄντος) it is impossible to predicate the definition of the” subordinate “subjects, yet with some we predicate the name: the definition of ‘whiteness’ thus is not of the body in which it is, but only the name
- HoP 2",267
6185,"All other things however,” besides Definition (λόγος) and “in most cases name, are related to primary substances as subjects” (the individual), “or are inherent in them
- HoP 2",176
6186,"Thus without the primary substances none of the rest could exist, for they are the basis (ὑποκεῖσθαι) of all else
- HoP 2",121
6189,"The second treatise is on Interpretation (περὶ ἑρμηνείας); it is the doctrine of judgments and propositions
- HoP 2",115
6190,"Propositions exist where affirmation and negation, falsehood and truth are enunciated;115 they do not relate to pure thought when reason itself thinks; they are not universal but individual
- HoP 2",197
6191,"Cicero and Giordano Bruno worked this out more fully
- HoP 2",60
6192,"Aristotle gives a large number of general points of view which can be taken of an object, a proposition or a problem; each problem can be directly reduced to these different points of view, that must everywhere appear
- HoP 2",225
6194,"In the same way Aristotle separates120 the dialectic and demonstrative syllogisms from the rhetorical and every kind of persuasion, but he counts induction as belonging to what is rhetorical
- HoP 2",198
6196,"Aristotle goes through a number of such contradictions by the way of solving them; in so doing he proceeds quietly and carefully, and spares no pains, though they might have been made more dramatic
- HoP 2",205
6197,"We have before (Vol
- HoP 2",27
6198,"Of these five parts of the Aristotelian Organon, what is produced in our ordinary systems of logic is, as a matter of fact, of the slightest and most trivial description, consisting as it does mainly of what is contained in the introduction of Porphyry
- HoP 2",260
6200,"Aristotle has rendered a never-ending service in having recognized and determined the forms which thought assumes within us
- HoP 2",131
6202,"Even contemplation, or a knowledge of the numerous forms and modes assumed by this activity, is interesting and important enough
- HoP 2",136
6205,"The best of what is stated respecting the forms of judgment, conclusion, &c, in ordinary logic, is taken from the works of Aristotle; as far as details are concerned, much has been spun out and added to it, but the truth is to be found with Aristotle
- HoP 2",258
6206,"As regards the real philosophic nature of the Aristotelian logic, it has received in our text-books a position and significance as though it gave expression only to the activity of the understanding as consciousness; hence it is said to direct us how to think correctly
- HoP 2",277
6211,"Thus by logicians they are held to be forms whose content is something entirely different, because they have not even the form of the content; and the meaning which is given to them—namely that they are forms—is found fault with
- HoP 2",236
6213,"But in that point of view and in the blame awarded the truth itself is missed, for untruth is the form of opposition between subject and object, and the lack of unity in them; in this case the question is not put at all as to whether anything is absolutely true or not
- HoP 2",276
6214,"These determinations have certainly no empirical content, but thought and its movement is itself the content—and, indeed, as interesting a content as any other that can be given; consequently this science of thought is on its own account a true science
- HoP 2",260
6217,"Thus they are only the material of truth, the formless content; their deficiency is hence not that they are only forms but rather that form is lacking to them, and that they are in too great a degree content
- HoP 2",215
6220,"Now this content is none other than the speculative Idea
- HoP 2",64
6221,"Conceptions of the understanding or of reason constitute the essence of things, not certainly for that point of view, but in truth; and thus also for Aristotle the conceptions of the understanding, namely the categories, constitute the essential realities of Being
- HoP 2",272
6222,"If they are thus in and for themselves true, they themselves are their own, and thus the highest content
- HoP 2",112
6223,"But in ordinary logic this is not the case, and even as these are represented in the Aristotelian works they are only universal thought-determinations, between which the abstract understanding makes distinctions
- HoP 2",219
6224,"This, however, is not the logic of speculative thought, ie of reason as distinguished from understanding; for there the identity of the understanding which allows nothing to contradict itself is fundamental
- HoP 2",214
6225,"However little this logic of the finite may be speculative in nature, yet we must make ourselves acquainted with it, for it is everywhere discovered in finite relationships
- HoP 2",180
6226,"There are many sciences, subjects of knowledge, &c, that know and apply no other forms of thought than these forms of finite thought, which constitute in fact the general method of dealing with the finite sciences
- HoP 2",221
6227,"Mathematics, for instance, is a constant series of syllogisms; jurisprudence is the bringing of the particular under the general, the uniting together of both these sides
- HoP 2",178
6228,"Aristotle is thus the originator of the logic of the understanding; its forms only concern the relationship of finite to finite, and in them the truth cannot be grasped
- HoP 2",176
6229,"But it must be remarked that Aristotle’s philosophy is not by any means founded on this relationship of the understanding; thus it must not be thought that it is in accordance with these syllogisms that Aristotle has thought
- HoP 2",232
6230,"If Aristotle did so, he would not be the speculative philosopher that we have recognized him to be; none of his propositions could have been laid down, and he could not have made any step forward, if he had kept to the forms of this ordinary logic
- HoP 2",255
6232,"Aristotle, in the Politics, for instance (supra, pp
- HoP 2",59
6233,"For this reason the individual logical form has in itself no truth, not because it is the form of thought, but because it is determinate thought, individual form, and to be esteemed as such
- HoP 2",197
6234,"But as system and absolute form ruling this content, thought has its content as a distinction in itself, being speculative philosophy in which subject and object are immediately identical, and the Notion and the universal are the realities of things
- HoP 2",257
6236,"But in this case logic is the science of reason, speculative philosophy of the pure Idea of absolute existence, which is not entangled in the opposition of subject and object, but remains an opposition in thought itself
- HoP 2",227
6237,"Yet we certainly may allow that much in logic is an indifferent form
- HoP 2",76
6238,"At this point we would leave off as far as the Aristotelian philosophy is concerned, and from this it is difficult to break away
- HoP 2",136
6239,"For the further we go into its details, the more interesting it becomes, and the more do we find the connection which exists among the subjects
- HoP 2",151
6241,"For Aristotle is so rich a treasure-house of philosophic conceptions, that much material is found in him which is ready for further working upon, which may be put forward more abstractly, and in which individual propositions may be brought into prominence
- HoP 2",263
6243,"Thus of Theophrastus as of many others (Dicæarchus of Messina, for instance), amongst whom Strato of Lampsacus, the successor of Theophrastus, is best known, there is not much to tell
- HoP 2",191
6244,"As regards Dicæarchus, Cicero says, (Tusc
- HoP 2",49
6245,"Hence, if what is said of him is accurate, he was most unfaithful to the beliefs of Aristotle, because he led everything back to mechanism and chance and did away with the immanent end, without accepting the false teleology of modern times

6247,"But in practical life the Peripatetic school maintained as the principle of happiness, the unity of reason and inclination
- HoP 2",130
6248,"We thus may set aside any further expansion of the Peripatetic philosophy, because it has no longer the same interest, and later on tended to become a popular philosophy (Vol
- HoP 2",182
6249,"This decay of the Aristotelian philosophy is, indeed, closely connected with the circumstance already mentioned (pp
- HoP 2",123
6251,"When in the Christian West science disappeared amongst the Christians, the fame of Aristotle shone forth with equal brilliance amongst the Arabians, from whom, in later times, his philosophy was again passed over to the West
- HoP 2",232
6255,"The triumph over this system was thus a triumph over that principle, and consequently the triumph of free, spontaneous thought
- HoP 2",134
6256,"But another side of this triumph is the triumph of the commonplace point of view that broke free from the Notion and shook off the yoke of thought
- HoP 2",154
6258,"In science, too, in place of subtle thoughts, subtle sight has commenced; a beetle or a species of bird is distinguished with as great minuteness as were formerly conceptions and thoughts
- HoP 2",195
6261,"The unity of existence as existence is objective unity, thought, as that which is thought
- HoP 2",97
6262,"But unity, as Notion, the implicitly universal negative unity, time as absolutely fulfilled time, and in its fulfilment as being unity, is pure self-consciousness
- HoP 2",170
6264,"Here we have concluded the first division of Greek philosophy, and we have now to pass to the second period
- HoP 2",115
6265,"The first period of Greek philosophy extended to Aristotle, to the attainment of a scientific form in which knowledge has reached the standing of free thought
- HoP 2",166
6266,"Thus in Plato and Aristotle the result was the Idea; yet we saw in Plato the universal made the principle in a somewhat abstract way as the unmoved Idea; in Aristotle, on the other hand, thought in activity became absolutely concrete as the thought which thinks itself
- HoP 2",276
6267,"The next essential, one which now is immediately before us, must be contained in that into which Philosophy under Plato and Aristotle had formed itself
- HoP 2",159
6271,"Aristotle’s logic is really the opposite of this
- HoP 2",56
6273,"If even Plato on the whole proceeded in an empiric way, taking up this and that idea, each of which is in turn examined, with Aristotle this loose method of procedure appears still more clearly
- HoP 2",201
6275,"The highest Idea with Aristotle consequently once more stands only as a particular in its own place and without being the principle of his whole philosophy
- HoP 2",163
6276,"Hence the next necessity in Philosophy is that the whole extent of what is known must appear as one organization of the Notion; that in this way the manifold reality may be related to that Idea as the universal, and thereby determined
- HoP 2",242
6277,"This is the standpoint which we find in this second period
- HoP 2",66
6278,"A systematic philosophy such as this becomes in the first place dogmatism, in antagonism to which, because of its one-sided character, scepticism immediately arises
- HoP 2",172
6279,"In the same way the French call what is dogmatic systématique, and système that in which all the conceptions must consistently proceed from one determination; hence to them systématique is synonymous with one-sided
- HoP 2",222
6281,"Hence this principle stands up formally and abstractly, and the particular is not yet deduced from it, for the universal is only applied to the particular and the rules for this application sought out
- HoP 2",208
6282,"In Aristotle the Idea is at least implicitly concrete, as the consciousness of the unity of subjective and objective, and therefore it is not one-sided
- HoP 2",159
6283,"Should the Idea be truly concrete, the particular must be developed from it
- HoP 2",83
6284,"The other relation would be the mere bringing of the particular under the universal, so that both should be mutually distinguished; in such a case the universal is only a formal principle, and such a philosophy is therefore one-sided
- HoP 2",241
6285,"But the true difficulty is that the two endeavours, the development of the particular from the Idea, and the bringing of the particular under the universal, collide with one another
- HoP 2",189
6286,"The manifestations of the physical and spiritual world must first, from their respective sides, be prepared for and worked into the Notion, so that the other sciences can form therefrom universal laws and principles
- HoP 2",223
6287,"Then for the first time can speculative reason present itself in determinate thoughts, and bring perfectly to consciousness the inwardly existing connection between them
- HoP 2",177
6288,"As dogmatic, however, those philosophies, it may be further said, are assertive likewise, because in such a method the principle is only asserted and is not truly proved
- HoP 2",177
6289,"For a principle is demanded under which everything is subsumed; thus it is only pre-supposed as the first principle
- HoP 2",123
6290,"Before this we have had abstract principles such as pure Being, but here the particular, with which begins the distinction from what is different, became posited as the purely negative
- HoP 2",192
6291,"That necessity, on the other hand, makes for a universal which must likewise be in the particular, so that this should not be set aside, but should have its determinate character through the universal
- HoP 2",208
6292,"This demand for a universal, even though still unproved principle, is henceforth present to knowledge
- HoP 2",109
6293,"What answers to this demand now appears in the world through the inward necessity of mind—not externally, but as being in conformity with the Notion
- HoP 2",156
6294,"This necessity has produced the philosophy of the Stoics, Epicureans, New Academy, and Sceptics, which we have now to consider
- HoP 2",134
6295,"If we have remained too long in the consideration of this period, we may now make amends for this protraction, for in the next period we may be brief
- HoP 2",157
6297,"Along with this last we would take the New Academy, which has entirely merged in it—while in the Older Academy, Plato’s philosophy indubitably still maintained its purity
- HoP 2",178
6299,"The application of universal to particular is here the relationship that prevails, for the reflection that from the universal itself the separation of the totality is developed, is not yet present
- HoP 2",204
6301,"Now since this is what we have in so-called Dogmatism, it is a philosophizing of the understanding, in which Plato’s and Aristotle’s speculative greatness is no longer present
- HoP 2",183
6302,"In respect of this relationship, the task of Philosophy now comes to be summed up in the twofold question which we spoke of earlier (Vol
- HoP 2",144
6303,"At this point we may better than before, and also from a different point of view, explain the necessity for this phenomenon
- HoP 2",131
6305,"Yet because this question had only been formally and dogmatically answered, the dialectic of Scepticism, or the knowledge of the one-sidedness of this principle as a dogmatic principle, at once appeared
- HoP 2",210
6306,"A further result of this mode of philosophizing is that the principle, as formal, is subjective, and consequently it has taken the real significance of the subjectivity of self-consciousness
- HoP 2",198
6307,"Because of the external manner in which the manifold is received, the highest point, that in which thought finds itself in its most determinate form, is self-consciousness
- HoP 2",179
6309,"Nature and the political world are certainly also concrete, but externally concrete; the arbitrary concrete is, on the other hand, not in the determinate universal Idea, but only in self-consciousness and as being personal
- HoP 2",230
6310,"The second ruling determination is consequently that of the wise men
- HoP 2",76
6312,"The thought of the criterion as of the one principle is, in its immediate actuality, the subject itself; thought and the thinker are thus immediately connected
- HoP 2",167
6313,"Because the principle of this philosophy is not objective but dogmatic, and rests on the impulse of self-consciousness towards self-satisfaction, it is the subject whose interests are to be considered
- HoP 2",208
6314,"The subject seeks on its own account a principle for its freedom, namely, immovability in itself; it must be conformable to the criterion, ie to this quite universal principle, in order to be able to raise itself into this abstract independence
- HoP 2",252
6315,"Self-consciousness lives in the solitude of its thought, and finds therein its satisfaction
- HoP 2",99
6316,"These are the fundamental determinations in the following philosophies: the exposition of their main principles will come next, but to go into details is not advisable
- HoP 2",175
6318,"In the bright Grecian world the individual attached himself more to his state or to his world, and was more at home in it
- HoP 2",129
6319,"The concrete morality, the impulse towards the introduction of the principle into the world through the constitution of the state, which we see in Plato, the concrete science that we find in Aristotle, here disappear
- HoP 2",224
6320,"In the wave of adversity which came across the Roman world, everything beautiful and noble in spiritual individuality was rudely swept away
- HoP 2",147
6321,"In this condition of disunion in the world, when man is driven within his inmost self, he has to seek the unity and satisfaction, no longer to be found in the world, in an abstract way
- HoP 2",192
6322,"The Roman world is thus the world of abstraction, where one cold rule was extended over all the civilized world
- HoP 2",119
6323,"The living individualities of national spirit in the nations have been stifled and killed; a foreign power, as an abstract universal, has pressed hard upon individuals
- HoP 2",175
6324,"In such a condition of dismemberment it was necessary to fly to this abstraction as to the thought of an existent subject, that is, to this inward freedom of the subject as such
- HoP 2",185
6325,"As what was held in estimation was the abstract will of the individual ruler of the world, the inward principle of thought also had to be an abstraction which could bring forth a formal, subjective reconciliation only
- HoP 2",225
6326,"A dogmatism erected on a principle made effectual through the form of the understanding could alone satisfy the Roman mind
- HoP 2",130
6327,"These philosophies are thus conformable to the spirit of the Roman world, as indeed Philosophy in general ever stands in close connection with the world in its ordinary aspect (Vol
- HoP 2",188
6328,"The Roman world has, indeed, produced a formal patriotism and corresponding virtue, as also a developed system of law; but speculative philosophy could not proceed from such dead material—we could only expect good advocates and the morality of a Tacitus
- HoP 2",261
6329,"These philosophies, always excepting Stoicism, also arose amongst the Romans in opposition to their ancient superstitions, just as now Philosophy comes forward in the place of religion
- HoP 2",192
6330,"The three principles of Stoicism, Epicureanism and Scepticism are necessary; in the first there is the principle of thought or of universality itself, but yet determined in itself; the abstract thought is here the determining criterion of the truth
- HoP 2",256
6331,"There is opposed to thought, in the second place, the determinate as such, the principle of individuality, feeling generally, sensuous perception and observation
- HoP 2",169
6332,"These two form the principles of the Stoic and Epicurean philosophies
- HoP 2",77
6334,"Besides Stoicism and Epicureanism, there is, in the third place, Scepticism, the negation of these two one-sided philosophies which must be recognized as such
- HoP 2",166
6335,"The principle of Scepticism is thus the active negation of every criterion, of all determinate principles of whatever kind they be, whether knowledge derived from the senses, or from reflection on ordinary conceptions, or from thought
- HoP 2",242
6336,"Thus the next result arrived at is that nothing can be known
- HoP 2",68
6337,"Yet the imperturbability and uniformity of mind in itself, which suffers through nothing, and which is affected neither by enjoyment, pain, nor any other bond, is the common standpoint and the common end of all these philosophies
- HoP 2",237
6338,"Thus however gloomy men may consider Scepticism, and however low a view they take of Epicureanism, all these have in this way been philosophies
- HoP 2",151
6339,"But in adopting the principle of these philosophies, they at the same time perfected it and elevated it more into the form of scientific thought
- HoP 2",152
6341,"Hence with the Stoics, as also really with the Epicureans, instead of genuine speculation, we only meet with an application of the one-sided, limited principle, and thus we require in both to enter merely upon a general view of their principle
- HoP 2",251
6344,"With Aristotle each conception is considered absolutely in its determination and as separate from any other; here the conception certainly is in this relation and is not absolute, but at the same time it is not in and for itself
- HoP 2",236
6345,"Because thus the individual is not considered absolutely but only relatively, the whole working out is not interesting, for it is only an external relation
- HoP 2",163
6346,"Likewise with Aristotle the individual only is taken into consideration, but this consideration is lost sight of by the speculative treatment adopted: here, however, the individual is taken up and the treatment is likewise external
- HoP 2",239
6348,"As a contribution to the history of the philosophy of the Stoics, we first of all desire to mention the more eminent Stoics
- HoP 2",131
6349,"The founder of the Stoic School is Zeno (who must be distinguished from the Eleatic); he belonged to Cittium, a town in Cyprus, and was born about the 109th Olympiad
- HoP 2",173
6351,"Zeno himself travelled to Athens, and, according to some, he found a further motive to live for Philosophy, in that he lost all his possessions by a shipwreck
- HoP 2",166
6352,"What he did not lose was the cultured nobility of his mind and his love of rational understanding
- HoP 2",105
6353,"Zeno visited several sections of the Socratics, and particularly Xenocrates, a man belonging to the Platonic School, who, on account of the strictness of his morality and the austerity of his whole demeanour, was very celebrated
- HoP 2",236
6354,"Thus he underwent the same ordeals as those to which the holy Francis of Assisi subjected himself, and succumbed to them just as little
- HoP 2",143
6355,"This may be seen by the fact that while no testimony was given without oath in Athens, the oath was in his case dispensed with, and his simple word believed—and his teacher Plato is said often to have remarked to him that he might sacrifice to the Graces
- HoP 2",262
6356,"Then Zeno also visited Stilpo, a Megaric, whom we already know about (Vol
- HoP 2",81
6357,"I p 464), and with whom he studied dialectic for ten years
- HoP 2",66
6358,"Philosophy was considered as the business of his life, and of his whole life, and not studied as it is by a student who hurries through his lectures on Philosophy in order to hasten on to something else
- HoP 2",210
6360,"From this his school received the name of Stoic
- HoP 2",55
6361,"Like Aristotle his principal endeavour was to unite Philosophy into one whole
- HoP 2",85
6363,"Hence with less vanity his temperance in the satisfaction of his absolute wants was almost as great, for he lived on nothing but water, bread, figs and honey
- HoP 2",165
6366,"In addition to this he shall be publicly buried in the Ceramicus
- HoP 2",72
6367,"And for the crown and the building of the tomb, a commission of five men shall be appointed” Zeno flourished about the 120th Olympiad (about 300 BC)

6375,"His logic and dialectic were what contributed most largely to his fame, and hence it was said that if the gods made use of dialectic, they would use none other than that of Chrysippus
- HoP 2",191
6376,"His literary activity is likewise admired, for the number of his works, as Diogenes Laërtius tells us, amounted to seven hundred and five
- HoP 2",145
6377,"It is said of him in this regard that he wrote five hundred lines every day
- HoP 2",83
6378,"But the manner in which his writings were composed detracts very much from our wonder at this facility in writing, and shows that most of his works consisted of compilations and repetitions
- HoP 2",197
6379,"He often wrote over again respecting the very same thing; whatever occurred to him he put down on paper, dragging in a great variety of evidence
- HoP 2",152
6380,"Thus he quoted almost entire books by other writers; and someone gave expression to the belief that if all that belonged to others were taken away from his books, only white paper would be left
- HoP 2",201
6381,"But of course it is not so bad as all this, as we may see by all the quotations from the Stoics, where the name of Chrysippus is placed at the head, as it always is, and his conclusions and explanations are used by preference
- HoP 2",233
6382,"His writings, of which Diogenes Laërtius mentions a long list, have, however, all been lost to us; so much is nevertheless correct, that he was the main constructor of the Stoic logic

- HoP 2",204
6385,"On the contrary, as in the case of Seneca and the later Stoics, in Epictetus or Antoninus, all speculative interest was really lost, and a rhetorical and hortatory disposition shown, of which mention cannot be made in a history of Philosophy any more than of our sermons
- HoP 2",278
6386,"Epictetus of Hierapolis in Phrygia, born at the end of the first century after Christ, was first of all the slave of Epaphroditus, who, however, freed him, after which he betook himself to Rome

- HoP 2",116

6395,"As regards the philosophy of the Stoics themselves, they definitely separated it into those three parts which we have already met with (Vol
- HoP 2",147
6396,"There is Logic in the first place; secondly, Physics, or Natural Philosophy; and thirdly, Ethics, or the Philosophy of Mind, on the practical side especially
- HoP 2",165
6397,"The content of their philosophy has, however, not much that is original or productive
- HoP 2",93
6398,"As regards the Physics of the Stoics, we may in the first place say that it does not contain much that is peculiar to itself, since it is rather a compendium of the Physics of older times, and more especially of that of Heraclitus
- HoP 2",238
6399,"However, each of the three schools now being dealt with has had a very characteristic and definite terminology, which is more than can be altogether said of the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle

- HoP 2",175
6409,"The latter is matter, substance without quality, for quality is, generally speaking, form, ie that which forms universal matter into something particular
- HoP 2",161
6410,"This is indeed the reason likewise that with the Greeks quality is called τὸ ποιόν, just as we in German derive Beschaffenheit from Schaffen—that which is posited, the negative moment
- HoP 2",191
6411,"But the actuating, as the totality of forms, is, according to the Stoics, the Notion in matter; and this is God
- HoP 2",119
6412,"As regards the further nature of these forms, these universal laws of nature, and the formation of the world, the Stoics have in the main adopted the ideas of Heraclitus, for Zeno studied him very particularly (supra, p 239)

6413,"They thus make fire the real Notion, the active principle which passes into the other elements as its forms

- HoP 2",231
6421,"Thus Heraclitus and Stoicism rightly comprehended this process as a universal and eternal one
- HoP 2",101
6422,"This has even been done by Cicero, though in a more superficial way; in this reflection he falsely sees the conflagration of the world in time and the end of the world, which is quite another matter

6423,"Thus nothing but fire remains, through whose reanimation and through God the world will be renewed and the same order will return” This is spoken after the manner of the ordinary conception
- HoP 2",197
6424,"But to the Stoics everything is merely a Becoming
- HoP 2",57
6425,"However deficient this may be, God, as the fiery principle, is yet to them the whole activity of nature, and likewise the rational order of the same, and in this lies the perfect pantheism of the Stoic conception of nature

6427,"The world sends forth the seeds of the rational and is thus in itself rational;” that is to say, rational both generally, in the whole, and in each particular existent form
- HoP 2",180
6429,"However, speaking generally, only those belonging to earlier times had a physical element in their philosophy: those coming later neglected Physics entirely and kept alone to Logic and to Ethics
- HoP 2",202
6430,"The Stoics again speak of God and the gods according to the popular manner of regarding them
- HoP 2",100
6433,"Thus the Stoics remain at the general conception that each individual is comprehended in a Notion, and this again in the universal Notion, which is the world itself
- HoP 2",172
6435,"Epicureanism, on the contrary, proceeds towards the liberation of men from this superstition to which the Stoics are entirely given over
- HoP 2",144
6436,"Thus Cicero, in his work De divinatione, has taken the most part of his material from them, and much is expressly given as being the reasoning of the Stoics
- HoP 2",164
6437,"The fact that an eagle flies to the right, the Stoics accepted as a revelation of God, believing that thereby it was intimated to men what it was advisable for them to do in some particular circumstances
- HoP 2",211
6438,"Just as we find the Stoics speaking of God as having universal necessity, to them God, as Notion, has hence a relation to men and human ends likewise, and in this respect He is providence; thus they now arrived at the conception of particular gods also
- HoP 2",260
6439,"To make men know and comprehend at one time and not at another, is an inconsistency, ie an incomprehensibility, but this very incomprehensibility, this obscurity, is the triumph of the common way of regarding religions affairs
- HoP 2",234
6440,"Thus in the Stoics all the superstitions of Rome had their strongest supporters; all external, teleological superstition is taken under their protection and justified
- HoP 2",174
6441,"Because the Stoics started from the assertion that reason is God (it certainly is divine, but it does not exhaust divinity), they immediately made a bound from this universal to the revelation of that which operates for the sake of individual ends
- HoP 2",255
6442,"The truly rational is doubtless revealed to men as the law of God; but the useful, what is in conformity with individual ends, is not revealed in this truly divine revelation

6444,"In regard to the source of our knowledge of truth, or of the criterion, which in those times used to be discussed (Vol
- HoP 2",126
6445,"Thus a unity of apprehending thought and Being is set forth in which neither can exist without the other; by this is meant not sensuous conception as such, but that which has returned into thought and become proper to consciousness
- HoP 2",239
6446,"Some of the older Stoics, amongst whom we certainly find Zeno, called this criterion the very truth of reason (ὀρθὸς λόγος)
- HoP 2",131
6448,"According to Cicero’s account (Academ
- HoP 2",45
6449,"This double pressure, my pressing with the other hand that which is grasped, is said to signify conviction, my being conscious of the identity of thought with the content
- HoP 2",178
6450,"In fact, the matter is not made clear through this gesticulation of Zeno’s
- HoP 2",82
6451,"The first action, the open hand, is sensuous apprehension, immediate seeing, hearing, &c; the first motion of the hand is then, speaking generally, spontaneity in grasping
- HoP 2",179
6452,"This first assent is likewise given by fools; it is weak, and may be false
- HoP 2",82
6453,"The next moment is the closing of the hand, comprehension, taking something in; this makes the ordinary conception truth, because the ordinary conception becomes identical with thought
- HoP 2",192
6454,"By this my identity with this determination is indeed set forth, but this is not yet scientific knowledge, for science is a firm, secure, unchangeable comprehension through reason or thought, which is that which rules or directs the soul
- HoP 2",245
6455,"Midway between scientific knowledge and folly is the true Notion as the criterion, although as yet it is not itself science; in it thought gives its approbation to existence and recognizes itself, for approbation is the harmony of a thing with itself
- HoP 2",258
6456,"But in scientific knowledge a perception of the first elements and determinate knowledge through thought of the object is contained
- HoP 2",139
6457,"Thus the ordinary conception as apprehended is thought; scientific knowledge is the consciousness of thought, the knowledge of that harmony
- HoP 2",147
6458,"We may also give our assent to these conclusions of the Stoics with their various stages, since in them there is a perception which is undoubtedly true
- HoP 2",159
6460,"Now this would be consciousness itself, but what this last can compare is nothing more than its conception, and—not the object, but—its conception again
- HoP 2",160
6461,"Consciousness thus really accepts the conception of the object; it is by this approbation that the conception actually receives truth—the testimony of mind to the objective rationality of the world
- HoP 2",205
6463,"For the action of thought consists in this, that thought in and for itself gives its approbation and recognizes the object as being in conformity with itself; this it is in which lies the power of truth—or approbation is the expression of this harmony, or judgment itself
- HoP 2",279
6464,"In this, say the Stoics, the truth is contained; it is an object which is likewise thought, so that the thought that gives its assent is the ruling thought which posits the harmony of subject with content
- HoP 2",212
6465,"The fact that anything is or has truth is thus not because it is (for this moment of Being is only ordinary conception), but the fact that it is, has its power in the approbation of consciousness
- HoP 2",203
6466,"But this thought alone and for itself is not the truth, nor is the truth as such contained in it, for the Notion requires the objective element and is only the rational consciousness respecting the truth
- HoP 2",211
6467,"But the truth of the object itself is contained in the fact that this objective corresponds to thought, and not the thought to the objective; for this last may be sensuous, changeable, false, and contingent, and thus it is untrue for mind

6469,"Sextus Empiricus (adv
- HoP 2",29
6470,"This general idea is the only one which is interesting in the Stoics, but even in this very principle, limitations are found to be present
- HoP 2",146
6471,"It merely expresses the truth as subsisting in the object, as thought of, yet for that very reason it is still a very formal determination, or not in itself the real Idea
- HoP 2",178
6472,"From this point of view Sextus Empiricus (adv
- HoP 2",53
6473,"The most striking thing that he says is what relates to the following
- HoP 2",77
6474,"The fact that anything is, rests in its being thought—the fact that it is thought in something being there; the one is the pre-supposition of the other
- HoP 2",159
6475,"That is to say, the Stoics assert that a thing exists, not because it is, but through thought; but consciousness for its existence requires another, for thought is likewise one-sided
- HoP 2",190
6476,"In this criticism by Sextus it is indicated that thought requires an object as an external to which it gives its approbation
- HoP 2",132
6477,"There can be no talk of its being here indicated that the thinking mind in order to exist as consciousness does not require the object; this is really inherent in its conception
- HoP 2",185
6478,"But the “this” of the object as an external is only a moment which is not the only one or the essential
- HoP 2",111
6480,"But likewise, having gone into itself, it has now from itself to beget its object and give itself the content which it sends forth from itself
- HoP 2",150
6481,"Stoicism is only this return of mind into itself, positing the unity of itself and the object, and recognizing the harmony; but not the going forth again to the extension of the real knowledge of a content from itself
- HoP 2",225
6483,"For if thought predominates, still it is always universal form alone
- HoP 2",76
6484,"On account of this universality thought yields nothing but the form of identity with itself; the ultimate criterion is thus only the formal identity of the thought which discovers harmony
- HoP 2",195
6485,"But it may be asked, with what?
- HoP 2",39
6486,"For there no absolute self-determination, no content that proceeds from thought as such is to be found; and hence everything may harmonize with my thought
- HoP 2",162
6487,"The criterion of the Stoics is consequently only the principle of contradiction; yet when we remove the contradiction from absolute reality, it is indeed self-identical, but for that very reason empty
- HoP 2",208
6488,"The harmony must be a higher one; there must be harmony with self in what is other than self, in content, in determination; and thus it must be harmony with harmony
- HoP 2",172
6489,"In accordance with this recognition of the principle of the Stoics, both their logic and their morality is judged; neither the one nor the other arrives at being immanent free science
- HoP 2",191
6491,"Then along with this comes in, for the first time, the question respecting the harmony of thought and object or the demand that an appropriate content of thought be shown
- HoP 2",178
6494,"Thus what was formerly excluded from the simple Notion, now comes into it again; this separation between activity of the understanding and object must indeed be made, but likewise the unity in the object as such has to be shown, if it is only something thought
- HoP 2",268
6495,"Hence Scepticism cast up this opposition more especially to the Stoics, and the Stoics amongst themselves had always to improve on their conceptions
- HoP 2",156
6496,"As we have just seen (p 250) in Sextus Empiricus, they did not quite know whether they should define conception as impression or alteration, or in some other way
- HoP 2",169
6498,"Then the thought-forms are themselves incorporeal
- HoP 2",57
6500,"If the thought-forms could in fact have attained the form of content, they would have been a content of thought in itself
- HoP 2",129
6501,"But as they were they had value as laws of thought (λεκτά)135 merely
- HoP 2",76
6502,"The Stoics indeed had a system of immanent determinations of thought, and actually did a great deal in this direction; for Chrysippus specially developed and worked out this logical aspect of things, and is stated to have been a master in it (supra, pp
- HoP 2",260
6503,"But this development took a very formal direction; there are the ordinary well-known forms of inference, five of which are given by Chrysippus, while others give sometimes more and sometimes fewer
- HoP 2",204
6504,"The wise man is specially skilful in dialectic, we are told by the Stoics, for all things, both physical and ethical, are perceived through a knowledge of logic136 But thus they have ascribed this perception to a subject, without stating who this wise man is (p 250)
- HoP 2",274
6506,"It would be superfluous to speak further of their logic any more than of their theory of judgments, which in part coincides with it, and in part is a grammar and a rhetoric; by it no real scientific content can be reached
- HoP 2",229
6507,"For this logic is not, like Plato’s dialectic, the speculative science of the absolute Idea; but, as formal logic, as we saw above (p 254), it is science as the firm, secure, unalterable comprehension of reasons, and stops short at the perception of the same
- HoP 2",266
6508,"This logical element, whose essence consists pre-eminently in escaping to the simplicity of the conception to that which is not in opposition to itself nor falls into contradiction, obtains the upper hand
- HoP 2",212
6509,"This simplicity, which has not negativity and content in itself, requires a given content which it may not abrogate—but consequently it cannot thus attain to a genuine “other” through itself
- HoP 2",198
6510,"The Stoics have constituted their logic often in the most isolated fashion; the principal point that is established here is that the objective corresponds to thought, and they investigated this thought more closely
- HoP 2",222
6512,"This is the point of view most important in the philosophy of the Stoics; it thus showed itself in their physics also
- HoP 2",125
6514,"For according to him the Stoics say: “The first desire (ὁρμή) of the animal is for self-preservation, because nature from the beginning reconciled each existence with itself
- HoP 2",181
6515,"This first object innate in every animal” (immanent desire) “is thus the harmony of the animal with itself, and the consciousness of the same,” the self-consciousness through which “the animal is not alienated from itself
- HoP 2",229
6516,"Thus it repels what is injurious and accepts what is serviceable to it” This is Aristotle’s conception of the nature of adaptation to an end, in which, as the principle of activity, both the opposite and its sublation are contained
- HoP 2",239
6517,"The case is similar in regard to man; his end is self-preservation, but with a conscious end, with consideration, according to reason
- HoP 2",141
6518,"To live in accordance with nature is thus, to the Stoics, to live rationally
- HoP 2",84
6519,"This now appears somewhat like certain receipts given by the Stoics for the purpose of discovering right motive forces in regard to virtue
- HoP 2",146
6521,"With the Stoics right reason and the securing of it on its own account, is the highest principle
- HoP 2",104
6522,"But here, too, we immediately see that we are thereby merely led round in a circle in a manner altogether formal, because virtue, conformity to nature, and reason, are only determined through one another
- HoP 2",211
6523,"Virtue consists in living conformably with nature, and what is conformable to nature is virtue
- HoP 2",102
6524,"Likewise thought must further determine what is in conformity with nature, but conformity with nature again is that alone which is determined through reason
- HoP 2",164
6525,"The virtue of the happy man is when everything occurs according to the harmony of the genius (δαίμονος) of each individual with reference to the will of the disposer of all things” Thus everything remains as it was in a universal formalism
- HoP 2",247
6526,"We must throughout allow to the Stoics that virtue consists in following thought, ie the universal law, right reason; anything is moral and right only in as far as a universal end is in it fulfilled and brought into evidence
- HoP 2",232
6527,"This last is the substantial, the essential nature of a relationship, and in it we have that which is really in thought alone
- HoP 2",133
6528,"The universal which must be the ultimate determination in action, is, however, not abstract, but the universal in this relationship, just as, for example, in property the particular is placed on one side
- HoP 2",211
6529,"Because man, as a man of thought and culture, acts according to his perception, he subordinates his impulses and desires to the universal; for they are individual
- HoP 2",170
6530,"There is in each human action an individual and particular element; but there is a distinction as to whether the particular as such is solely insisted upon or whether in this particular the universal is secured
- HoP 2",218
6531,"It is to the securing of this universal that the energy of Stoicism is directed
- HoP 2",87
6532,"But this universal has still no content and is undetermined, and thereby the Stoic doctrines of virtue are incomplete, empty, meaningless and tedious
- HoP 2",157
6533,"Virtue indeed is commended in a forcible, lively and edifying manner, but as to what this universal law of virtue is, we have no indications given us
- HoP 2",157
6534,"The other side as regards the good is external existence, and the agreement of circumstances, of external nature, with the end aimed at by man
- HoP 2",150
6535,"In the third place it is neither external nor is it a matter of self-consciousness alone, when the self-same man is virtuous and happy” These conclusions are quite good
- HoP 2",176
6536,"Morality does not require to look so coldly on what concerns utility, for every good action is in fact useful, ie it has actuality and brings forth something good
- HoP 2",170
6537,"An action which is good without being useful is no action and has no actuality
- HoP 2",86
6538,"That which in itself is useless in the good is its abstraction as being a non-reality
- HoP 2",93
6539,"Men not only may, but must have the consciousness of utility; for it is true that it is useful to know the good
- HoP 2",119
6540,"Utility means nothing else but that men have a consciousness respecting their actions
- HoP 2",93
6541,"If this consciousness is blameworthy, it is still more so to know much of the good of one’s action and to consider it less in the form of necessity
- HoP 2",155
6542,"Thus the question was raised as to how virtue and happiness are related to one another, a theme of which the Epicureans have also treated
- HoP 2",145
6543,"Here it was, as in more recent times, regarded as the great problem to discover whether virtue gives happiness, taken altogether by itself, whether the conception of happiness is included in its conception
- HoP 2",213
6544,"That union of virtue and happiness, as the mean, is thus rightly represented as being perfect, neither pertaining only to self-consciousness nor to externality
- HoP 2",167
6545,"In order to be able to give a general answer to this question, we most recollect what was said above of the principle of self-preservation, according to which virtue has to do with the rational nature
- HoP 2",208
6546,"The fulfilment of its end is happiness as finding itself realized, and as the knowledge or intuitive perception of itself as an external—a harmony of its Notion or its genius with its Being or its reality
- HoP 2",212
6547,"The harmony of virtue with happiness thus means that the virtuous action realizes itself in and for itself, man becomes in it an immediate object to himself, and he comes to the perception of himself as objective, or of the objective as himself
- HoP 2",252
6548,"This rests in the conception of action and particularly of good action
- HoP 2",78
6549,"For the bad destroys reality and is opposed to self-preservation; but the good is what makes for its self-preservation and effectuates it—the good end is thus the content that realizes itself in action
- HoP 2",209
6551,"The distinction rests in the fact that the Stoics have merely remained at this general conception, and set it forth immediately as actuality; in it however, the conception of virtuous action is merely expressed, and not reality
- HoP 2",235
6552,"A further point is that just because the Stoics have remained at this position, the opposition between virtue and happiness immediately enters in, or, in abstract form, that between thought and its determination
- HoP 2",219
6553,"These opposites are with Cicero honestum and utile, and their union is the question dealt with137 Virtue, which is living in accordance with the universal law of nature, is confronted by the satisfaction of the subject as such in his particularity
- HoP 2",255
6555,"In the second place, I, as the will that fulfils law, am only the formal character which has to carry out the universal; and thus, as willing the universal, I am in accord with myself as thinking
- HoP 2",203
6556,"The two now come into collision, and because I seek the one satisfaction or the other, I am in collision with myself, because I am also individual
- HoP 2",154
6558,"Such at once show themselves, however, to be merely contingent and external; hence we soon get past this standpoint in the problem, and thus external enjoyment, riches, noble birth, &c, do not accord with virtue or happiness
- HoP 2",232
6560,"Thus these may be the concomitants of virtue, although it is a matter of indifference whether they are so or not, for since this satisfaction is not end, it is equally a matter of indifference if pain is the concomitant of virtue
- HoP 2",237
6562,"Because this following of the determinations of reason is in opposition to enjoyment, man should seek his end or satisfaction in nothing else than in the satisfaction of his reason, in satisfying himself in himself, but not in anything outwardly conditioned
- HoP 2",265
6563,"Hence much has been said by the Stoics in respect of that which pertains to the passions being something that is contradictory
- HoP 2",134
6564,"The writings of Seneca and Antoninus contain much that is true in this regard, and they may be most helpful to those who have not attained to the higher degree of conviction
- HoP 2",181
6565,"Seneca’s talent must be recognized, but we must also be convinced that it does not suffice
- HoP 2",98
6566,"But no noble and good man will feel regret that he has fallen short in pleasure; pleasure is thus neither useful nor good
- HoP 2",129
6569,"For if the consciousness of freedom is my end, in this universal end of the pure consciousness of my independence all particular determinations of freedom which are constituted by duties and laws, have disappeared
- HoP 2",221
6570,"The strength of will of Stoicism has therefore decided not to regard the particular as its essence, but to withdraw itself therefrom; we see on the one hand, that this is a true principle, but on the other, it is at the same time abstract still
- HoP 2",252
6571,"Now because the principle of the Stoic morality professes to be the harmony of mind with itself, what should be done is not to let this remain formal, and therefore not to let what is not contained in this self-contained be any longer shut out of it
- HoP 2",257
6572,"That freedom which the Stoics ascribe to man is not without relation to what is other than himself; thus he is really dependent, and under this category happiness really falls
- HoP 2",183
6573,"My independence is only one side, to which the other side, the particular side of my existence, hence does not yet correspond
- HoP 2",133
6574,"The old question, which at this time again came up, thus concerns the harmony between virtue and happiness
- HoP 2",114
6575,"Morality really contains my subjective conviction that that which I do is in conformity with rational determinations of will, with universal duties
- HoP 2",155
6576,"That question is a necessary one, a problem which even in Kant’s time occupied men, and in endeavouring to solve it we must begin by considering what is to be understood by happiness
- HoP 2",190
6577,"Much more is afterwards said of that in which satisfaction is to be sought
- HoP 2",82
6578,"However, from what is external and exposed to chance we must at once break free
- HoP 2",87
6579,"Happiness in general means nothing more than the feeling of harmony with self
- HoP 2",85
6580,"That which is pleasing to the senses is pleasing because a harmony with ourselves is therein contained
- HoP 2",110
6581,"The contrary and unpleasing is, on the other hand, a negation, a lack of correspondence with our desires
- HoP 2",112
6582,"The Stoics have posited as the very essence of enjoyment this harmony of our inner nature with itself, but only as inward freedom and the consciousness, or even only the feeling of this harmony, so that enjoyment such as this is contained in virtue itself
- HoP 2",263
6583,"Yet this enjoyment ever remains a secondary matter, a consequence, which in so far as it is so cannot be made end, but should only be considered as an accessory
- HoP 2",168
6584,"The Stoics said in this regard that virtue is alone to be sought, but with virtue happiness on its own account is found, for it confers blessing explicitly as such
- HoP 2",171
6586,"The Stoics have been laughed at because they said that pain is no evil140 But toothache and the like are not in question as regards this problem
- HoP 2",152
6587,"Thus the problem throughout is only to be understood as the demand for a harmony of the rational will with external reality
- HoP 2",131
6588,"To this reality there also belongs the sphere of particular existence, of subjectivity, of personality, of particular interests
- HoP 2",135
6589,"But of these interests the universal alone truly pertains to this reality, for only in so far as it is universal, can it harmonize with the rationality of the will
- HoP 2",171
6591,"This inward unity with myself as felt, is happiness, and this is not destroyed by outward evil
- HoP 2",102
6592,"Another opposition is that within virtue itself
- HoP 2",55
6594,"Because virtue is thus that which is conformable to the real essence or law of things, in a general sense the Stoics called virtue everything, in every department, which is in conformity with law in that department
- HoP 2",222
6597,"Although much that is elevated and edifying may find its support here, an actual determination is still wanting; hence there is according to the Stoics only one virtue,142 and the wise man is the virtuous
- HoP 2",212
6599,"For if the Stoics had gone beyond the mere conception of action for the implicitly existent end, and had reached to the knowledge of the content, they would not have required to express this as a subject
- HoP 2",211
6600,"To them rational self-preservation is virtue
- HoP 2",52
6601,"But if we ask what it is that is evolved by virtue, the answer is to the effect that it is just rational self-preservation; and thus they have not by this expression got beyond that formal circle
- HoP 2",203
6602,"Moral reality is not expressed as that which is enduring, which is evolved and ever evolving itself
- HoP 2",107
6603,"And moral reality is just this, to exist; for as nature is an enduring and existent system, the spiritual as such must be an objective world
- HoP 2",148
6604,"To this reality the Stoics have, however, not reached
- HoP 2",61
6605,"Or we may understand this thus
- HoP 2",38
6606,"Their moral reality is only the wise man, an ideal and not a reality—in fact the mere conception whose reality is not set forth
- HoP 2",135
6607,"This subjectivity is already contained in the fact that moral reality, expressed as virtue, thereby immediately presents the appearance of being present only as a quality of the individual
- HoP 2",196
6608,"This virtue, as such, in as far as only the moral reality of the individual is indicated, cannot attain to happiness in and for itself, even though happiness, regarded in the light of realization, were only the realization of the individual
- HoP 2",248
6609,"For this happiness would be just the enjoyment of the individual as the harmony of existence with him as individual; but with him as individual true happiness does not harmonize, but only with him as universal man
- HoP 2",221
6612,"Stoic self-consciousness has not here to deal with its individuality as such, but solely with the freedom in which it is conscious of itself only as the universal
- HoP 2",170
6613,"Now could one call this happiness, in distinction to the other, true happiness, happiness would still, on the whole, remain a wrong expression
- HoP 2",150
6614,"The satisfaction of rational consciousness in itself as an immediate universal, is a state of being which is simulated by the determination of happiness; for in happiness we have the moment of self-consciousness as an individuality
- HoP 2",239
6615,"But this differentiated consciousness is not present in that self-satisfaction; for in that freedom the individual has rather the sense of his universality only
- HoP 2",168
6616,"Striving after happiness, after spiritual enjoyment, and talking of the excellence of the pleasures of science and art, is hence dull and insipid, for the matter with which we are occupied has no longer the form of enjoyment, or it does away with that conception
- HoP 2",270
6617,"This sort of talk has indeed passed away and it no longer has any interest
- HoP 2",82
6618,"The true point of view is to concern oneself with the matter itself and not with enjoyment, that is, not with the constant reflection on the relation to oneself as individual, but with the matter as a matter, and as implicitly universal
- HoP 2",244
6619,"But no further notice or speech about this is requisite, nor are we to imagine that there is much that is rational and important within it
- HoP 2",146
6620,"But the Stoic consciousness does not get beyond this individuality to the reality of the universal, and therefore it has only to express the form, the real as an individual, or the wise man
- HoP 2",197
6621,"The highest point reached by Aristotle, the thought of thought, is also present in Stoicism, but in such a way that it does not stand in its individual capacity as it appears to do in Aristotle, having what is different beside it, but as being quite alone
- HoP 2",263
6623,"Here pure consciousness thus attains to being its own object, and because reality is to it only this simple object, its object annuls in itself all modes of existence, and is nothing in and for itself, being therein only in the form of something abrogated
- HoP 2",263
6624,"All is merged into this: the simplicity of the Notion, or its pure negativity, is posited in relation to everything
- HoP 2",123
6625,"But the real filling in, the objective mode, is wanting, and in order to enter into this, Stoicism requires that the content should be given
- HoP 2",148
6626,"Hence the Stoics depicted the ideal of the wise man in specially eloquent terms, telling how perfectly sufficient in himself and independent he is, for what the wise man does is right
- HoP 2",191
6627,"The description of the ideal formed by the Stoics is hence a common subject of discussion and is even devoid of interest; or at least the negative element in it is alone noteworthy
- HoP 2",188
6629,"Similarly the wise man may eat human flesh,143 &c But a universal reason is something quite indeterminate
- HoP 2",113
6631,"The Stoic wise man is thus also ‘enlightened,’ in the sense that where he did not know how to bring the natural instinct into the form of a rational reason, he trampled upon nature
- HoP 2",188
6632,"Thus that which is called natural law or natural instinct comes into opposition with what is set forth as immediately and universally rational
- HoP 2",150
6634,"But should the wise man hence not be bound by the former because it is not something immediately thought, this is merely the fault of his want of comprehension
- HoP 2",167
6635,"As we have, however, seen that in the sphere of theory the thought-out simplicity of the truth is capable of all content, so we find this also to be the case with the good, that which is practically thought-out, without therefore being any content in itself
- HoP 2",265
6637,"But this is so for the reason that it only seeks out and knows the most immediate grounds and cannot know whether there are not other aspects and other grounds
- HoP 2",167
6639,"Because the Stoics indeed placed virtue in thought, but found no concrete principle of rational self-determination whereby determinateness and difference developed, they, in the first place, have carried on a reasoning by means of grounds to which they lead back virtue
- HoP 2",277
6640,"They draw deductions from facts, connections, consequences, from a contradiction or opposition; and this Antoninus and Seneca do in an edifying way and with great ingenuity
- HoP 2",180
6642,"Hence reasons are as a whole subjective
- HoP 2",47
6643,"This method of reflecting on self and on what we should do, leads to the giving to our ends the breadth of reflection due to penetrative insight, the enlargement of the sphere of consciousness
- HoP 2",200
6644,"It is thus I who bring forward these wise and good grounds
- HoP 2",66
6645,"They do not constitute the thing, the objective itself, but the thing of my own will, of my desire, a bauble through which I set up before me the nobility of my mind; the opposite of this is self-oblivion in the thing
- HoP 2",225
6648,"Because the moral principle of the Stoics remains at this formalism, all that they treat of is comprised in this
- HoP 2",120
6649,"For their thoughts are the constant leading back of consciousness to its unity with itself
- HoP 2",98
6650,"The power of despising existence is great, the strength of this negative attitude sublime
- HoP 2",97
6651,"The Stoic principle is a necessary moment in the Idea of absolute consciousness; it is also a necessary manifestation in time
- HoP 2",133
6652,"For if, as in the Roman world, the life of the real mind is lost in the abstract universal; the consciousness, where real universality is destroyed, must go back into its individuality and maintain itself in its thoughts
- HoP 2",228
6654,"It is thus herein implied, not that the condition of the world is a rational and right one, but only that the subject as such should assert his freedom in himself
- HoP 2",170
6655,"Everything that is outward, world, relationships, &c, are so disposed as to be capable of being abrogated; in it there is thus no demand for the real harmony of reason and existence; or that which we might term objective morality and rectitude is not found in it
- HoP 2",270
6658,"But the condition of the Roman Empire was not altered by this philosophic emperor, and his successor, who was of a different character, was restrained by nothing from inaugurating a condition of things as bad as his own wicked caprice might direct
- HoP 2",255
6659,"It is something much higher when the inward principle of the mind, of the rational will, likewise realizes itself, so that there arises a rational constitution, a condition of things in accordance with culture and law
- HoP 2",225
6660,"Through such objectivity of reason, the determinations which come together in the ideal of the wise man are first consolidated
- HoP 2",134
6661,"There then is present a system of moral relationships which are duties; each determination is then in its place, the one subordinated to the other, and the higher is predominant
- HoP 2",185
6663,"Because these duties do not merely appear to hold good in a general sense, but are also recognized in my conscience as having the character of the universal, the harmony of the rational will and reality is established
- HoP 2",225
6664,"On the one hand, the objective system of freedom as necessity exists, and, on the other, the rational in me is real as conscience
- HoP 2",137
6665,"The Stoic principle has not yet reached to this more concrete attitude, as being on the one hand abstract morality, and, on the other, the subject that has a conscience
- HoP 2",176
6666,"The freedom of self-consciousness in itself is the principle, but it has not yet attained to its concrete form, and its relation to happiness exists only in its determination as indifferent and contingent, which relation must be given up
- HoP 2",245
6667,"In the concrete principle of rationality the condition of the world, as of my conscience, is not, however, indifferent
- HoP 2",126
6668,"This is a general description of Stoic morality; the main point is to recognize its point of view and chief relationships
- HoP 2",129
6669,"Because in the Roman world a perfectly consistent position, and one conformable to existing conditions, has attained to the consciousness of itself, the philosophy of the Stoics has more specially found its home in the Roman world
- HoP 2",238
6670,"The noble Romans have hence only proved the negative, an indifference to life and to all that is external; they could be great only in a subjective or negative manner—in the manner of a private individual
- HoP 2",212
6672,"So far as I understand law, I can find in it, among the Romans, nothing either of thought, Philosophy or the Notion
- HoP 2",123
6673,"If we are to call the reasoning of the understanding logical thought, they may indeed be held to be philosophers, but this is also present in the reasoning of Master Hugo, who certainly does not claim to be a philosopher
- HoP 2",228
6674,"The reasoning of the understanding and the philosophic Notion are two different things
- HoP 2",94
6675,"We shall now proceed to what is in direct contrast to the Stoic philosophy, Epicureanism
- HoP 2",96
6676,"The Epicurean philosophy, which forms the counterpart to Stoicism, was just as much elaborated as the Stoic, if, indeed, it were not more so
- HoP 2",148
6679,"And though, in so doing, he may have given a higher scientific form to the doctrines of the Cyrenaics
- HoP 2",109
6680,"Notwithstanding this proviso, before we take this philosophy into consideration, we must carefully divest ourselves of all the ideas commonly prevalent regarding Epicureanism
- HoP 2",182
6681,"As regards the life of Epicurus, he was born in the Athenian village of Gargettus in Ol
- HoP 2",95
6682,"His opponents, especially the Stoics, have raked up against him more accusations than I can tell of, and have invented the most trivial anecdotes respecting his doings
- HoP 2",175
6683,"He had poor parents; his father, Neocles, was village schoolmaster, and Chærestrata, his mother, was a sorceress: that is, she earned money, like the women of Thrace and Thessaly, by furnishing spells and incantations, as was quite common in those days
- HoP 2",260
6684,"The father, taking Epicurus with him, migrated with an Athenian colony to Samos, but here also he was obliged to give instruction to children, because his plot of land was not sufficient for the maintenance of his family
- HoP 2",228
6685,"At the age of about eighteen years, just about the time when Aristotle was living in Chalcis, Epicurus returned to Athens
- HoP 2",129
6687,"When Epicurus was twelve years old, he read with his teacher Hesiod’s account of Chaos, the source of all things; and this was perhaps not without influence on his philosophic views
- HoP 2",189
6688,"Otherwise he professed to be self-taught, in the sense that he produced his philosophy entirely from himself; but we are not to suppose from this that he did not attend the lectures or study the writings of other philosophers
- HoP 2",233
6689,"Neither is it to be understood that he was altogether original in his philosophy as far as content was concerned; for, as will be noted later, his physical philosophy especially is that of Leucippus and Democritus
- HoP 2",221
6690,"It was at Mitylene in Lesbos that he first came forward as teacher of an original philosophic system, and then again at Lampsacus in Asia Minor; he did not, however, find very many hearers
- HoP 2",196
6691,"After having for some years led an unsettled life, he returned in about the six and thirtieth year of his age to Athens, to the very centre of all Philosophy; and there, some time after, he bought for himself a garden, where he lived and taught in the midst of his friends
- HoP 2",280
6692,"Though so frail in body that for many years he was unable to rise from his chair, in his manner of living he was most regular and frugal, and he devoted himself entirely to science, to the exclusion of all other interests
- HoP 2",229
6693,"Even Cicero, though in other respects he has little to say in his favour, bears testimony to the warmth of his friendships, and adds that no one can deny he was a good, a humane, and a kindly man
- HoP 2",203
6694,"Diogenes Laërtius gives special commendation to his reverence towards his parents, his generosity to his brothers, and his benevolence to all
- HoP 2",149
6695,"He died of stone in the seventy-first year of his age
- HoP 2",61
6699,"The reason for this lies, as we shall presently see, in his system itself; and the further result, from a scientific point of view, ensued that we can name no celebrated disciples of his who carried on and completed his teaching on their own account
- HoP 2",257
6700,"For his disciples could only have gained distinction for themselves by going further than Epicurus did
- HoP 2",110
6701,"But to go further would have been to reach the Notion, which would only have confused the system of Epicurus; for what is devoid of thought is thrown into confusion by the introduction of the Notion, and it is this very lack of thought which has been made a principle
- HoP 2",275
6703,"Therefore his philosophy has not advanced nor developed, but it must also be said that it has not retrograded; a certain Metrodorus alone is said to have carried it on further in some directions
- HoP 2",202
6705,"The number of his writings is said to have amounted to three hundred; it is scarcely to be regretted that they are lost to us
- HoP 2",133
6706,"The main source of our knowledge of Epicurus is the whole of the tenth book of Diogenes Laërtius, which after all gives us but scanty information, though it deals with the subject at great length
- HoP 2",203
6707,"De natura, illustr
- HoP 2",26
6708,"Orellius, Lipsiæ 1818), has neither extended nor enriched our knowledge; so that we must in all earnestness deprecate the finding of the remaining writings
- HoP 2",163
6709,"A detailed explanation of how sensation can be such, he has given in his so-called Canonic
- HoP 2",98
6710,"As in the case of the Stoics, we have first to speak of the manner which Epicurus adopted of determining the criterion of truth; secondly, of his philosophy of nature; and thirdly and lastly, of his moral teaching
- HoP 2",221
6713,"For neither can one sensation judge another, both being alike, since both have equal authority;”—when the presentations of sight are of the same kind, every one of them must admit the truth of all the rest
- HoP 2",213
6714,"Thought, in the same way, cannot criticize the senses; for all thought itself depends on the sensation,” which forms its content
- HoP 2",136
6715,"But sensuous perception may go far wrong
- HoP 2",48
6716,"In this way even the unknown” (the unperceived) “may be indicated by means of that which appears” (perception)
- HoP 2",118
6717,"Of this conception of objects of perception which are not immediate we shall have to speak more particularly hereafter (p 292) in dealing with physical science
- HoP 2",167
6718,"These objects of perception are themselves the material and content of thought, inasmuch as thought is continually making use of the images of these things
- HoP 2",163
6719,"These representations are universal, but certainly the Epicureans have not placed universality in the form of thinking, but only said it is caused by frequency of appearance
- HoP 2",181
6720,"This is further confirmed by the name which is given to the image which has thus arisen within us
- HoP 2",105
6722,"That is the acquiescence which we have found taking place with the Stoics when thought gives its assent to a content; thought, however, which recognizes the thing as its own, and receives it into itself, with the Stoics remained formal only
- HoP 2",248
6723,"With Epicurus the unity of the conception of the object with itself exists also as a remembrance in consciousness, which, however, proceeds from the senses; the image, the conception, is what harmonizes with a sense-perception
- HoP 2",234
6724,"The recognition of the object is here an apprehension, not as an object of thought, but as an object of imagination; for apprehension belongs to recollection, to memory
- HoP 2",176
6725,"The name, it is true, is something universal, belongs to thinking, makes the manifold simple, yea, is in a high degree ideal; but in such a way that its meaning and its content are the sensuous, and are not thus to be counted as simple, but as sensuous
- HoP 2",260
6726,"In this way opinion is established instead of knowledge
- HoP 2",63
6727,"In the last place, opinion is nothing but the reference of that general conception, which we have within us, to an object, a perception, or to the testimony of the senses; and that is the passing of a judgment
- HoP 2",217
6728,"For in a conception we have anticipated that which comes directly before our eyes; and by this standard we pronounce whether something is a man, a tree, or not
- HoP 2",167
6730,"Opinion is true if it corresponds with the type; and it has its criterion in perceiving whether it repeats itself as it was before or not
- HoP 2",145
6731,"This is the whole of the ordinary process in consciousness, when it begins to reflect
- HoP 2",93
6732,"When we have the conception, it requires the testimony that we have seen or still see the object in question
- HoP 2",116
6733,"From the sensuous perceptions blue, sour, sweet, and so on, the general conceptions which we possess are formed; and when an object again comes before us, we recognize that this image corresponds with this object
- HoP 2",220
6734,"This is the whole criterion, and a very trivial process it is; for it goes no further than the first beginnings of the sensuous consciousness, the immediate perception of an object
- HoP 2",188
6735,"The next stage is without doubt this, that the first perception forms itself into a general image, and then the object which is present is subsumed under the general image
- HoP 2",179
6737,"From these external perceptions of objects presently existing, with which we here began, the affections, the internal perceptions, which give the criteria for practical life are however distinguished; they are of two kinds, either pleasant or unpleasant
- HoP 2",261
6738,"That is to say, they have as their content pleasure or satisfaction, and pain: the first, as that which peculiarly belongs to the perceiver, is the positive; but pain, as something alien to him, is the negative
- HoP 2",218
6740,"This constitutes the whole Canon of Epicurus, the universal standard of truth; it is so simple that nothing can well be simpler, and yet it is very abstract
- HoP 2",164
6741,"It consists of ordinary psychological conceptions which are correct on the whole, but quite superficial; it is the mechanical view of conception having respect to the first beginnings of observation
- HoP 2",206
6742,"But beyond this there lies another and quite different sphere, a field that contains determinations in themselves; and these are the criteria by which the statements of Epicurus must be judged
- HoP 2",200
6743,"Nowadays even Sceptics are fond of speaking of facts of consciousness; this sort of talk goes no further than the Epicurean Canon
- HoP 2",137
6745,"In raising the question of how we come by our conceptions, there lies a double question: on the one hand, since sense-perceptions are not like conceptions, but require an external object, what is the objective manner in which the images of external things enter into us?
- HoP 2",278
6746,"On the other hand, it may be asked how conceptions of such things as are not matter of perception arise in us; this seems to be an activity of thought, which derives conceptions such as these from other conceptions; we shall, however, see presently (pp
- HoP 2",260
6747,"Epicurus says, “Such a conception does not contradict our senses, when we take into consideration how pictures produce their effects in a very similar way, I mean by bringing us into sympathy with external things
- HoP 2",220
6748,"Therefore emanations, like pictures, pass out from them into us, so that we see and know the forms and colours of things”153 This is a very trivial way of representing sense-perception
- HoP 2",192
6749,"Epicurus took for himself the easiest criterion of the truth that is not seen, a criterion still in use, namely that it is not contradicted by what we see or hear
- HoP 2",170
6750,"For in truth such matters of thought as atoms, the detachment of surfaces, and so forth, are beyond our powers of sight
- HoP 2",127
6751,"Certainly we manage to see and to hear something different; but there is abundance of room for what is seen and what is conceived or imagined to exist alongside of one another
- HoP 2",183
6752,"If the two are allowed to fall apart, they do not contradict each other; for it is not until we relate them that the contradiction becomes apparent
- HoP 2",155
6753,"There would be no truth, no likeness of our perceptions, which we receive as in pictures or in dreams or in any other way, if there were nothing on which we, as it were, put out our faculty of observation
- HoP 2",212
6755,"The Epicurean theory of knowledge reduces itself to these few passages, some of which are also obscurely expressed, or else not very happily selected or quoted by Diogenes Laërtius; it is impossible to have a theory less explicitly stated
- HoP 2",246
6757,"If this negative is also again, as soul, affirmative, Epicurus in the notional determination of thinking has only reached this negativity, that we look away from something, ie we interrupt that inflowing stream
- HoP 2",218
6758,"The answer to the question of what this interrupting movement exactly is, when taken for itself, is connected with the more advanced conceptions of Epicurus; and in order to discuss them more in detail, we must go back to the implicit basis of his system
- HoP 2",262
6759,"This constitutes on the whole the metaphysic of Epicurus; in it he has expounded his doctrine of the atom, but not with greater definiteness than did Leucippus and Democritus
- HoP 2",182
6761,"But that which is in itself altogether indivisible can have neither figure nor magnitude; and even weight, direction upon something else, is opposed to the abstract repulsion of the atom
- HoP 2",194
6762,"Epicurus even says: “Every property is liable to change, but the atoms change not
- HoP 2",89
6763,"In all dissolutions of the composite, something must remain a constant and indissoluble, which no change can transform into that which is not, or bring from non-being into Being
- HoP 2",185
6764,"This unchangeable element, therefore, is constituted by some bodies and figures
- HoP 2",87
6765,"The properties are a certain relation of atoms to each other”155 In like manner we have already seen with Aristotle (p 178) that the tangible is the foundation of properties: a distinction which under various forms is still always made and is in common use
- HoP 2",264
6766,"We mean by this that an opposition is established between fundamental properties, such as we here have in weight, figure and magnitude, and sensuous properties, which are only in relation to us, and are derived from the former original differences
- HoP 2",255
6769,"All particular forms, all objects, light, colour, &c, the soul itself even, are nothing but a certain arrangement of these atoms
- HoP 2",136
6770,"This is what Locke also said, and even now Physical Science declares that the basis of things is found in molecules, which are arranged in a certain manner in space
- HoP 2",172
6771,"But these are empty words, and a crystal, for instance, is not a certain arrangement of parts, which gives this figure
- HoP 2",126
6772,"It is thus not worth while to deal with this relation of atoms; for it is an altogether formal way of speaking, as when Epicurus again concedes that figure and magnitude, in so far as pertaining to atoms, are something different from what they are as they appear in things
- HoP 2",280
6773,"The two are not altogether unlike; the one, implicit magnitude, has something in common with apparent magnitude
- HoP 2",119
6774,"The latter is transitory, variable; the former has no interrupted parts,156 that is, nothing negative
- HoP 2",109
6775,"But the determination of the atoms, as originally formed in this or that fashion, and having original magnitude of such and such a kind, is a purely arbitrary invention
- HoP 2",176
6776,"That interruption, which we regarded above (p 288) as the other side to atoms, or as vacuum, is the principle of movement: for the movement of thought is also like this and has interruptions
- HoP 2",198
6777,"Thought in man is the very same as atoms and vacuum are in things, namely their inward essence; that is to say, atoms and vacuum belong to the movement of thought, or exist for this in the same way as things are in their essential nature
- HoP 2",245
6778,"The movement of thinking is thus the province of the atoms of the soul; so that there takes place simultaneously therein an interruption of the inward flow of atoms from without
- HoP 2",185
6779,"There is therefore nothing further to be seen in this than the general principle of the positive and negative, so that even thought is affected by a negative principle, the moment of interruption
- HoP 2",203
6780,"This principle of the Epicurean system, further applied to the difference in things, is the most arbitrary and therefore the most wearisome that can be imagined
- HoP 2",168
6781,"Besides their different figures, atoms have also, as the fundamental mode in which they are affected, a difference of movement, caused by their weight; but this movement to some extent deviates from the straight line in its direction
- HoP 2",241
6782,"That is to say, Epicurus ascribes to atoms a curvilinear movement, in order that they may impinge on one another and so on157 In this way there arise particular accumulations and configurations; and these are things
- HoP 2",223
6783,"Other physical properties, such as taste and smell, have their basis again in another arrangement of the molecules
- HoP 2",122
6784,"But there is no bridge from this to that, or what results is simply empty tautology, according to which the parts are arranged and combined as is requisite in order that their appearance may be what it is
- HoP 2",212
6785,"The transition to bodies of concrete appearance Epicurus has either not made at all, or what has been cited from him as far as this matter is concerned, taken by itself, is extremely meagre
- HoP 2",197
6786,"The opinion that one hears expressed respecting the Epicurean philosophy is in other respects not unfavourable; and for this reason some further details must be given regarding it
- HoP 2",187
6787,"For since absolute Being is constituted by atoms scattered and disintegrated, and by vacuum, it directly follows that Epicurus denies to these atoms any relationship to one another which implies purpose
- HoP 2",210
6789,"Or else Epicurus altogether denies that Notion and the Universal are the essential, and because all originations are to him chance combinations, for him their resolution is just as much a matter of chance
- HoP 2",212
6790,"The divided is the first and the truly existent, but at the same time chance or external necessity is the law which dominates all cohesion
- HoP 2",146
6792,"In contrast to this, the teleological view enters largely into the philosophy of the Stoics, and is there very fully developed
- HoP 2",134
6793,"To show that conformity to an end is lacking, Epicurus brings forward the most trivial examples; for instance, that worms and so on are produced by chance from mud through the warmth of the sun
- HoP 2",201
6794,"Taken in their entirety, they may very well be the work of chance in relation to others; but what is implicit in them, their Notion and essence is something organic: and the comprehension of this is what we have now to consider
- HoP 2",235
6796,"The Stoics take the opposite course of finding essential Being in the object of thought or the universal; and they fail equally in reaching the content, temporal existence, which, however, they most inconsistently assume
- HoP 2",228
6797,"We have here the metaphysics of Epicurus; nothing that he says farther on this head is of interest
- HoP 2",106
6799,"Going further, the principle of the manner in which Epicurus looks on nature, lies in the conceptions he forms, which we have already had before us (pp
- HoP 2",159
6801,"In this way it comes about that by such images we can apprehend the unknown which does not lend itself immediately to perception; for from what is known we must argue to what is unknown
- HoP 2",193
6802,"This is nothing else but saying that Epicurus judged by analogy, or that he makes so-called evidence the principle of his view of Nature; and this is the principle which to this day has authority in ordinary physical science
- HoP 2",232
6803,"Thus we reach general concepts, laws, forces, and so on, electricity and magnetism, for instance, and these are then applied by us to such objects and activities as we cannot ourselves directly perceive
- HoP 2",210
6804,"As an example, we know about the nerves and their connection with the brain; in order that there may be feeling and so on, it is said that a transmission from the finger-tips to the brain takes place
- HoP 2",207
6805,"But how can we represent this to ourselves?
- HoP 2",51
6806,"By anatomy we can lay bare the nerves, it is true, but not the manner of their working
- HoP 2",94
6807,"We represent these to ourselves on the analogy of other phenomena of transmission, for instance as the vibration of a tense string that passes through the nerves to the brain
- HoP 2",182
6809,"In the same way light is represented as filaments, rays, or as vibrations of the ether, or as globules of ether, each of which strikes on the other
- HoP 2",155
6810,"This is an analogy quite in the manner of Epicurus
- HoP 2",58
6812,"In so saying, Epicurus is talking idly; his words fall on the ear and the fancy, but looked on more narrowly they disappear
- HoP 2",131
6813,"So, for instance, we see the moon shine, without being able to have any nearer experience of it
- HoP 2",103
6814,"On this subject Epicurus says: “The moon may have its own light, or a light borrowed from the sun; for even on earth we see things which shine of themselves, and many which are illuminated by others
- HoP 2",206
6815,"Nothing hinders us from observing heavenly things in the light of various previous experiences, and from adopting hypotheses and explanations in accordance with these
- HoP 2",174
6817,"For, as we see a spark both in lightning and electricity, we conclude from this circumstance common to both that the two are analogical; therefore, we come to the conclusion that lightning also is an electric phenomenon
- HoP 2",227
6818,"But clouds are not hard bodies, and by moisture electricity is more likely to be dispersed; therefore, such talk has just as little truth in it as the fancy of Epicurus
- HoP 2",176
6819,"Application of sensuous conceptions according to analogy is often termed comprehension or explanation, but in reality there is in such a process not the faintest approach to thought or comprehension
- HoP 2",206
6820,"One circumstance which strikes us at once in Epicurus is the lack of observation and experience with regard to the mutual relations of bodies: but the kernel of the matter, the principle, is nothing else than the principle of modern physics
- HoP 2",248
6821,"This method of Epicurus has been attacked and derided, but on this score no one need be ashamed of or fight shy of it, if he is a physicist; for what Epicurus says is not a whit worse than what the moderns assert
- HoP 2",220
6822,"Indeed, in the case of Epicurus the satisfactory assurance is likewise always present of his emphasizing the fact most strongly that just because the evidence of the senses is found to be lacking, we must not take our stand on any one analogy
- HoP 2",250
6825,"Of the Epicurean method in philosophy we may say this, that it likewise has a side on which it possesses value, and we may in some measure assent when we hear, as we frequently do, the Epicurean physics favourably spoken of
- HoP 2",231
6826,"Aristotle and the earlier philosophers took their start in natural philosophy from universal thought a priori, and from this developed the Notion; this is the one side
- HoP 2",175
6828,"The a priori is with Aristotle, for instance, most excellent but not sufficient, because to it there is lacking connection with and relation to experience and observation
- HoP 2",178
6829,"This leading up of the particular to the universal is the finding out of laws, natural forces, and so on
- HoP 2",112
6830,"It may thus be said that Epicurus is the inventor of empiric Natural Science, of empiric Psychology
- HoP 2",107
6832,"The same effect which followed the rise of a knowledge of natural laws, &c, in the modern world was produced by the Epicurean philosophy in its own sphere, that is to say, in so far as it is directed against the arbitrary invention of causes
- HoP 2",249
6833,"The more, in later times, men made acquaintance with the laws of Nature, the more superstition, miracles, astrology, &c disappeared; all this fades away owing to the contradiction offered to it by the knowledge of natural laws
- HoP 2",234
6835,"In contrast with this, the way in which Epicurus works, when the conceptions and not thought are concerned, accords with truth
- HoP 2",134
6838,"The physics of Epicurus were therefore famous for the reason that they introduced more enlightened views in regard to what is physical, and banished the fear of the gods
- HoP 2",177
6839,"Superstition passes straightway from immediate appearances to God, angels, demons; or it expects from finite things other effects than the conditions admit of, phenomena of a higher kind
- HoP 2",194
6840,"To this the Epicurean natural philosophy is utterly opposed, because in the sphere of the finite it refuses to go beyond the finite, and admits finite causes alone; for the so-called enlightenment is the fact of remaining in the sphere of the finite
- HoP 2",257
6841,"There connection is sought for in other finite things, in conditions which are themselves conditioned; superstition, on the contrary, rightly or wrongly, passes at once to what is above us
- HoP 2",196
6842,"However correct the Epicurean method may be in the sphere of the conditioned, it is not so in other spheres
- HoP 2",115
6843,"Thus if I say that electricity comes from God, I am right and yet wrong
- HoP 2",79
6844,"For if I ask for a cause in this same sphere of the conditioned, and give God as answer, I say too much; though this answer fits all questions, since God is the cause of everything, what I would know here is the particular connection of the phenomenon
- HoP 2",259
6846,"To the natural philosophy of Epicurus there also belongs his conception of the soul, which he looks on as having the nature of a thing, just as the theories of our own day regard it as nerve-filaments, cords in tension, or rows of minute balls (p 294)
- HoP 2",259
6848,"The soul is capable of much change in itself, owing to the fineness of its parts, which can move very rapidly: it sympathizes with the rest of the aggregate, as we see by the thoughts, emotions and so on; but when it is taken away from us we die
- HoP 2",253
6849,"But the soul, on its part, has also the greatest sympathy with sensuous perception; yet it would have nothing in common with it, were it not in a certain measure covered by the rest of the aggregate” (the body)—an utterly illogical conception
- HoP 2",250
6851,"The above-mentioned (p 287) interruption of the streaming together of images of external things with our organs, as the ground of error, is now explained by the theory that the soul consists of peculiar atoms, and the atoms are separated from one another by vacuum
- HoP 2",272
6852,"With such empty words and meaningless conceptions we shall no longer detain ourselves; we can have no respect for the philosophic thoughts of Epicurus, or rather he has no thoughts for us to respect
- HoP 2",206
6853,"Besides this description of the soul the philosophy of mind contains the ethics of Epicurus, which of all his doctrines are the most decried, and therefore the most interesting; they may, however, also be said to constitute the best part of that philosophy
- HoP 2",264
6855,"Of course, if we regard the abstract principle involved in the ethics of Epicurus, our verdict cannot be other than exceedingly unfavourable
- HoP 2",148
6857,"If it is now alleged that feeling is the ground of action, and that because I find a certain impulse in myself it is for that reason right—this is Epicurean reasoning
- HoP 2",174
6858,"Everyone may have different feelings, and the same person, may feel differently at different times; in the same way with Epicurus it may be left to the subjectivity of the individual to determine the course of action
- HoP 2",224
6859,"But it is of importance to notice this, that when Epicurus sets tip pleasure as the end, he concedes this only so far as its enjoyment is the result of philosophy
- HoP 2",170
6861,"The true Epicureans were therefore, just as much as the Stoics, raised above all particular ties, for Epicurus, too, made his aim the undisturbed tranquillity of the wise man
- HoP 2",182
6863,"Here the universal and the particular meet; or the particular, regarded only in its bearings to the whole, is raised into the form of universality
- HoP 2",154
6864,"Thus it happens that, while materially, or as to content, Epicurus makes individuality a principle, on the other hand he requires the universality of thinking, and his philosophy is thus in accordance with that of the Stoics
- HoP 2",232
6866,"For every pleasure of Epicurus turns on something very paltry and poor, and we scarcely know how restricted it is, and how insipid
- HoP 2",138
6867,"The self-same law which we lay down for virtue he prescribes for pleasure; he requires that Nature be obeyed; but very little in the way of luxury is required to satisfy Nature
- HoP 2",184
6868,"What have we then here?
- HoP 2",31
6870,"Men who thus abandon themselves to crime seek only to hide their wickedness under the mantle of philosophy, and to furnish for their excesses a pretext and an excuse
- HoP 2",173
6872,"The principle of Epicurus is to live in freedom and ease, and with the mind at rest, and to this end it is needful to renounce much of that which men allow to sway them, and in which they find their pleasure
- HoP 2",215
6873,"The life of a Stoic is therefore but little different from that of an Epicurean who keeps well before his eyes what Epicurus enjoins
- HoP 2",140
6874,"The Cyrenaics rather made pleasure as a particular thing their end, while Epicurus, on the contrary, regarded it as a means, since he asserted painlessness to be pleasure, and allowed of no intermediate state
- HoP 2",216
6876,"But though the existence of the gods is known to be a fact, yet they are not such as the multitude suppose them to be
- HoP 2",125
6877,"He is therefore not impious who discards his faith in the gods of the multitude, but he who applies to them the opinions entertained of them by the mass” By these gods of Epicurus we can understand nothing else than the Holy, the Universal, in concrete form
- HoP 2",265
6878,"The Stoics held more to the ordinary conception, without indeed giving much thought to the Being of God; with the Epicureans, on the other hand, the gods express an immediate Idea of the system
- HoP 2",201
6879,"Epicurus says: “That which is holy and incorruptible has itself no trouble nor causes it to others; therefore it is unstirred by either anger or show of favour, for it is in weakness only that such find a place
- HoP 2",218
6881,"This general image, which is at the same time an anthropomorphic conception, is the same to which we give the name of Ideal, only that here the source assigned to it is the reiterated occurrence of images
- HoP 2",212
6882,"The gods thus seem to Epicurus to be Ideals of the holy life; they are also existent things, consisting of the finest atoms; they are, however, pure souls, unmixed with any grosser element, and therefore exempt from toil and trouble and pain
- HoP 2",249
6884,"The gods lead an existence of pure and passive self enjoyment, and trouble themselves not with the affairs of the world and of men
- HoP 2",138
6886,"But from this there follows only that they are, as it were, the implicit, as we see it stated of the soul and things palpable to the senses, that they have behind them what is implicit
- HoP 2",192
6887,"Our talk of qualities is no better; for if justice, goodness, and so on, are to be taken in sensu eminentiori, and not as they are with men, we have in God a Being in the same way possessed of only something resembling justice and the other qualities
- HoP 2",258
6888,"Worlds, as phenomena, are complete continuous concretions of such atoms, but concretions which are only external relations
- HoP 2",130
6889,"Between them, as in vacuum, there are thus these Beings also, which themselves are certainly concretions of atoms, but concretions which remain implicit
- HoP 2",160
6890,"Yet this leads only to confusion, if a closer definition is given, for concretion constitutes what is for the senses, but the gods, even if they were concretions, would not be realities exactly such as these
- HoP 2",215
6891,"In illogical fashion the general, the implicit, is taken out of reality and set above it, not as atoms, but just as before, as a combination of these atoms; in this way this combination is not itself the sensuous
- HoP 2",220
6892,"This seems ridiculous, but it is connected with the interruptions spoken of, and with the relation of the vacuum to the plenum, the atom
- HoP 2",144
6893,"So far, therefore, the gods belong to the category of negativity as against sensuality, and as this negative is thought, in that sense what Epicurus said of the gods may still to some extent be said
- HoP 2",206
6894,"To this determination of God a larger measure of objectivity of course belongs, but it is a perfectly correct assertion that God, as Thought, is a holy Being, to whom reverence is due for His own sake alone
- HoP 2",214
6895,"The first element in a happy life is therefore reverence for the gods, uninfluenced by fear or hope
- HoP 2",107
6896,"Further, a second point with Epicurus is the contemplation of death, the negative of existence, of self-consciousness in man; he requires us to have a true conception of death, because otherwise it disturbs our tranquillity
- HoP 2",231
6897,"He accordingly says: “Accustom thyself then to the thought that death concerns us not; for all good and evil is a matter of sensation, but death is a deprivation (στέρησις) of sensation
- HoP 2",193
6898,"Therefore the true reflection that death is no concern of ours, makes our mortal life one of enjoyment, since this thought does not add an endless length of days, but does away with the longing after immortality
- HoP 2",219
6899,"For nothing in life has terrors for him who has once truly recognized the fact that not to live is not a matter of dread
- HoP 2",128
6900,"Thus it is a vain thing to fear death, not because its presence but because the anticipation of it brings us pain
- HoP 2",121
6901,"For how can the anticipation of a thing pain us when its reality does not?
- HoP 2",82
6902,"There is therefore in death nothing to trouble us
- HoP 2",57
6903,"For when we are in life, death is not there, and when death is there, we are not
- HoP 2",88
6904,"Therefore death does not concern either the living or the dead” This is quite correct, if we look at the immediate; it is a thought full of meaning, and drives away fear
- HoP 2",177
6905,"Mere privation, which death is, is not to be confounded with the feeling of being alive, which is positive; and there is no reason for worrying oneself about it
- HoP 2",168
6906,"This the right way in which to regard the future also
- HoP 2",61
6907,"Epicurus passes on to speak of impulses, saying: “This moreover is to be kept in mind, that amongst impulses some are natural, but others are vain; and of those that are natural some are necessary while others are natural only
- HoP 2",234
6908,"Those that are necessary are either necessary to happiness, or tend to save the body from pain, or to self-preservation in general
- HoP 2",138
6909,"The perfect theory teaches how to choose that which promotes health of body and steadfastness of soul, and how to reject what impairs them, this being the aim of the holy life
- HoP 2",183
6910,"This is the end of all our actions, to have neither pain of body nor uneasiness of mind
- HoP 2",95
6911,"If we but attain to this, all turmoil of the soul is stilled, since the life no longer has to strive after something which it needs, and no longer has to seek anything outside of itself by which the welfare of soul and body is arrived at
- HoP 2",245
6914,"Simple dishes afford just as much enjoyment as costly banquets, if they appease hunger
- HoP 2",94
6915,"Therefore when we make pleasure our aim, it is not the enjoyments of the gourmand, as is often falsely thought, but freedom from both pain of body and uneasiness of mind
- HoP 2",177
6916,"We attain to this life of happiness by sober reason alone, which examines the grounds of all choice and all rejection, and expels the thoughts by which the soul’s rest is most disturbed
- HoP 2",193
6917,"It is surely better to be unhappy and reasonable than to be happy and unreasonable; for it is better that in our actions we should judge correctly than that we should be favoured by luck
- HoP 2",194
6918,"Meditate on this day and night, and let thyself be shaken by nought from thy peace of soul, that thou mayest live as a god amongst men; for the man who lives amongst such imperishable treasures has nothing in common with mortal men
- HoP 2",239
6919,"Of all those the first and foremost is reasonableness (φρόνησις), which on this account is still more excellent than philosophy; from it spring all the other virtues
- HoP 2",173
6921,"Hence the Epicureans describe their wise man in at least as glowing terms as the Stoics do theirs; and in both these systems the wise man is depicted with the same qualities, these being negative
- HoP 2",203
6922,"With the Stoics the Universal is the essential principle,—not pleasure, the self-consciousness of the particular as particular; but the reality of this self-consciousness is equally something pleasant
- HoP 2",208
6927,"The negative mean to these one-sided principles is the Notion, which, abrogating fixed extremes of determination such as these, moves them and sets them free from a mere state of opposition
- HoP 2",197
6928,"This movement of the Notion, the revival of dialectic—directed as it is against these one-sided principles of abstract thinking and sensation—we now see in its negative aspect, both in the New Academy and in the Sceptics
- HoP 2",228
6929,"Even the Stoics, as having their principle in thought, cultivated dialectic, though theirs was (pp
- HoP 2",106
6931,"In Scepticism we now really have an abrogation of the two one-sided systems that we have hitherto dealt with; but this negative remains negative only, and is incapable of passing into an affirmative
- HoP 2",206
6933,"The establishment of the Middle Academy is ascribed to Arcesilaus, and the New Academy is said to contain the philosophy of Carneades; but this distinction has no signification
- HoP 2",184
6934,"Both of these are closely connected with Scepticism, and the Sceptics themselves have often trouble in distinguishing their standpoint from the Academic principle
- HoP 2",170
6935,"Both have been claimed by Scepticism as Sceptics, but between the Academics and pure Scepticism a distinction has been drawn, which is certainly very formal, and has but little signification, but to which the Sceptics in their subtlety undoubtedly attached some meaning
- HoP 2",277
6936,"The distinction often consists in the meanings of words only, and in quite external differences
- HoP 2",103
6937,"The standpoint of the Academics is that they express the truth as a subjective conviction of self-consciousness; and this tallies with the subjective idealism of modern times
- HoP 2",182
6938,"The truth, in so far as it is only a subjective conviction, has hence been called, by the New Academy, the probable
- HoP 2",123
6939,"Although followers of Plato, and hence, Platonists, the Academicians did not remain at the standpoint of Plato, nor could they have done so
- HoP 2",147
6940,"But we easily see the connection of this principle with the Platonic doctrines, if we recollect that with Plato the Idea has been the principle, and that, indeed, on the whole, in the form of universality
- HoP 2",212
6941,"Plato remained, as we saw above (pp
- HoP 2",43
6942,"Plato’s Ideas are derived from the necessities of reason, from enthusiasm for the truth, but they are in themselves devoid of movement, and only universal, while Aristotle demands actuality, self-determining activity
- HoP 2",224
6943,"Plato’s dialectic has only attempted to assert the universal as such, and to demonstrate the determinate and particular to be null, thus leaving nothing at all but abstract universality
- HoP 2",193
6944,"His dialectic has hence very often a negative result, in which determinations are merely done away with and annulled
- HoP 2",124
6945,"The necessity for a scientific ground has necessarily caused us to be carried on beyond this Platonic point of view
- HoP 2",123
6947,"To the end they made a point of holding to the Platonic universality, uniting to this the Platonic dialectic also
- HoP 2",121
6948,"The principle of the New Academy could thus, like the Platonic dialectic, possess a dialectic attitude and bearing which proceeded to nothing affirmative; as, indeed, in many of Plato’s dialogues, mere confusion is what is arrived at
- HoP 2",241
6950,"Plato’s Ideas were thus torn from their rest through thought, because in such universality thought has not yet recognized itself as self-consciousness
- HoP 2",158
6951,"Self-consciousness confronted them with great pretensions, actuality in general asserted itself against universality; and the rest of the Idea necessarily passed into the movement of thought
- HoP 2",198
6952,"This movement now, however, in the New Academy turned dialectically against the determination of the Stoics and Epicureans, which rested on the fact that the criterion of the truth ought to be a concrete
- HoP 2",211
6953,"For example, in the conception as comprehended by the Stoics, there is a thought which likewise has a content, although, again, this union still remains very formal
- HoP 2",172
6954,"But the two forms in which the dialectic of the New Academy turns against this concrete, are represented by Arcesilaus and Carneades
- HoP 2",140
6956,"The opposition to the Dogmatists thus does not in the case of Arcesilaus proceed from the dialectic of the Sceptics, but from keeping to abstraction; and here we perceive the gulf marking out this epoch from any other
- HoP 2",225
6957,"Though he originally belonged to the Old Academy, yet the spirit of the time and the progressive development of Philosophy did not now admit of the simplicity of the Platonic manner
- HoP 2",189
6959,"Arcesilaus, familiar with all the Philosophy of those days, was by his contemporaries held to be as noble a man as he was a subtle and acute philosopher; being without pride in himself, he recognized the merits of others
- HoP 2",228
6960,"He lived in Athens, occupied the post of scholarch in the Academy, and was thus a successor of Plato
- HoP 2",108
6961,"After the death of Crates, the successor of Speusippus, the place of honour in the Academy devolved on Sosicrates, but he willingly gave it up in favour of Arcesilaus on account of the superiority of the latter in talent and philosophy
- HoP 2",243
6965,"Arcesilaus has certainly unthinkingly allowed that this content united to consciousness is a concrete such as was indicated, only he has asserted that this connection merely gives a perception with a good ground, and not what he calls truth
- HoP 2",248
6966,"This is called probability, but not quite appropriately; it is a universal set forth through the form of thought, and is only formal, having no absolute truth
- HoP 2",166
6967,"I c 33, § 233) puts this plainly in saying that “Arcesilaus has declared the withholding of approbation in relation to parts, to be a good, but the assenting to parts to be an evil,” because the assent only concerns parts
- HoP 2",229
6968,"That is, if thought is to be retained as a universal, it cannot come to be a criterion; and that is the meaning of Arcesilaus when he asks that the wise man should remain at the universal, and not go on to the determinate as if this determinate were the truth
- HoP 2",267
6969,"Sextus Empiricus gives us (adv
- HoP 2",38
6970,"Arcesilaus asserted as against the Stoics, that everything is incomprehensible (ἀκατάληπτα)
- HoP 2",99
6971,"He thus combated the conception of thought (καταληπτικὴν φαντασίαν), which to the Stoics is the point of most importance and the concrete truth
- HoP 2",151
6973,"Arcesilaus here argued in such a way as to show that between scientific knowledge and opinion the conception of thought is no criterion, for it is either in the wise man or the fool, and in the former it is knowledge, and in the latter, opinion
- HoP 2",252
6974,"If it is nothing excepting these, there remains to it nothing but an empty name” For knowledge must be a developed consciousness derived from reasons, but these reasons, as conceptions of thought, Arcesilaus states to be just such thoughts as those of the fool
- HoP 2",268
6975,"They are thus, no doubt, the concrete directing power which constitutes the principal content of our consciousness; but it is not proved that they are the truth
- HoP 2",168
6977,"Arcesilaus further gives effect to the distinctions which are more particularly brought up in modern times, and relied upon
- HoP 2",131
6979,"A sensuous image such as this, however, is foreign to thought, and with it thought cannot accord, because it is something different from it, something from which thought, on the contrary, holds itself aloof
- HoP 2",214
6980,"It is, in general, only to a thought that thought finds itself conformable, and only in a thought that it finds itself; thus only a universal axiom is capable of such accord, for only such abstract principles are immediately pure thoughts
- HoP 2",246
6981,"Arcesilaus thus holds it up against the Stoics that their principle contains a contradiction within itself, because the conception of thought is made to be the thought of another, but thought can only think itself
- HoP 2",221
6982,"This is a thought which concerns the inmost essence of the thing
- HoP 2",72
6983,"Arcesilaus thus here makes the same celebrated distinction as in recent times has again been brought forward with so much force as the opposition between thought and Being, ideality and reality, subjective and objective
- HoP 2",227
6984,"Things are something different from me
- HoP 2",46
6985,"How can I attain to things?
- HoP 2",35
6986,"Thought is the independent determination of a content as universal; but a given content is individual and hence we cannot assent to such
- HoP 2",144
6987,"The one is here, the other there; subjective and objective cannot pass to one another—this is a form of thought upon which for long the whole culture of modern philosophy has turned, and which we still find to-day
- HoP 2",221
6988,"It is important to have a consciousness of this difference, and to assert this consciousness against the principle of the Stoics
- HoP 2",136
6989,"It was of this unity of thought and reality that the Stoics ought to have given an account; and this they did not do, and indeed it was never done in ancient times
- HoP 2",171
6990,"For the ancients did not prove that the subjective element of thought and this objective content are really in their diversity the passing into one another, and that this identity is their truth; this was only found in Plato in an abstract form and as a first commencement
- HoP 2",280
6991,"The unity of thought and conception is the difficult matter; thus if thought, as such, is the principle, it is abstract
- HoP 2",127
6992,"The logic of the Stoics hence remained formal merely, and the attainment of a content could not be demonstrated
- HoP 2",119
6993,"Thought and Being are themselves such abstractions, and we may move to and fro between them for long without arriving at any determination
- HoP 2",146
6994,"Thus this unity of universal and particular cannot be the criterion
- HoP 2",75
6995,"With the Stoics the conception as comprehended appears to be immediately asserted; it is a concrete, but it is not shown that this is the truth of these distinct elements
- HoP 2",178
6996,"Against this immediately accepted concrete, the assertion of the difference of the two is thus quite consistent
- HoP 2",119
6997,"Determinate content has its opposite in a determinate which must likewise as an object of thought be true; and this destroys itself
- HoP 2",139
6998,"In this consists the blind wandering about in thoughts and reasons such as these, which are not grasped as Idea, as the unity of opposites, but in one of the opposites asserts one thing, and then, with as good reason, the opposite
- HoP 2",238
6999,"The truth of the world is, on the contrary, quite different, the universal law of reason which is as such for thought
- HoP 2",125
7000,"Reasons are relatively ultimate for a content, but not absolutely ultimate; they can only be regarded as good reasons, as probability, as the Academics express it
- HoP 2",170
7001,"This is a great truth which Arcesilaus had attained
- HoP 2",59
7002,"But because no unity can thus come forth, he then draws the conclusion that the wise man must withhold his assent, that is, not that he should not think, but that he must not merely for that reason regard as true that which is thought
- HoP 2",242
7004,"What is right in this is that the good ground does not extend as far as truth
- HoP 2",85
7005,"Arcesilaus thus remains at the indeterminate, at subjectivity of conviction, and a probability justified by good grounds
- HoP 2",128
7006,"Thus we see that in regard to what is positive, Arcesilaus does not really get any further than the Stoics, nor say anything different from what they do; only the form is different, because, what the Stoics call true, Arcesilaus calls well-founded or probable
- HoP 2",267
7007,"But, on the whole, he possessed a higher kind of knowledge than the Stoics, because what is thus founded cannot be held to have the significance of an implicit existence, but only a relative truth in consciousness
- HoP 2",221
7008,"Carneades was equally famous; he was one of the followers of Arcesilaus in the Academy, and he also lived in Athens, though considerably later
- HoP 2",150
7009,"He was born in Cyrene in Ol
- HoP 2",35
7010,"For he here held, after the manner of the Academics, two discourses on justice; the one for and the other against justice
- HoP 2",129
7011,"That on which both generally speaking rested, can easily be discovered
- HoP 2",78
7012,"In the justification of justice he took the universal as principle; but in showing its nullity, he laid weight on the principle of individuality, of self-interest
- HoP 2",170
7013,"To the young Romans who knew little of the opposition in the Notion, this was something new; they had no idea of such methods of applying thought, were much attracted by them, and were soon won over to them
- HoP 2",214
7014,"But the older Romans, and particularly the elder Cato, the Censor, who was then still living, saw this very unwillingly, and declaimed much against it, because the youths were thereby turned away from the strictness of ideas and virtues which prevailed in Rome
- HoP 2",268
7015,"As the evil gained ground, Caius Acilius made a proposition in the Senate to banish all philosophers from the city, amongst whom, naturally, without their names being mentioned, those three ambassadors were included
- HoP 2",223
7016,"The elder Cato, however, moved the Senate to conclude the business with the ambassadors as quickly as possible, so that they might again set forth, and return to their schools, and might henceforth instruct only the sons of the Greeks
- HoP 2",242
7017,"The Roman youths might then as formerly give ear to their laws and magistrates, and learn wisdom from intercourse with the senators174 But this taint can no more be avoided than could in Paradise the desire for knowledge
- HoP 2",228
7018,"The knowledge which is a necessary moment in the culture of a people, thus makes its appearance as the Fall from innocence, and as corruption
- HoP 2",149
7019,"An epoch such as this, in which thought appears to veer about, is then regarded as an evil as far as the security of the ancient constitution is concerned
- HoP 2",162
7020,"But this evil of thought cannot be prevented by laws, &c; it can and must be the healer of itself through itself alone, if thought through thought itself is truly brought to pass
- HoP 2",186
7021,"The philosophy of Carneades has been given to us in most detail by Sextus Empiricus; and all else of Carneades that we possess is likewise directed against the dogmatism of the Stoic and Epicurean philosophy
- HoP 2",215
7022,"The fact that the nature of consciousness is what is most particularly considered makes his propositions interesting
- HoP 2",124
7025,"For this activity of consciousness consists in the fact that it changes the objective, and thus does not allow the objective as it is to come to us immediately
- HoP 2",167
7026,"Hence the same attitude of separation is pre-supposed as formerly, viz that the understanding is to be regarded as an ultimate and clearly absolute relationship
- HoP 2",168
7027,"As against the Epicureans, Carneades maintains this: “Because the living is distinguished from the dead through the activity of sensation, by this means it will comprehend itself and what is external
- HoP 2",207
7028,"But this sensation which,” as Epicurus puts it (supra, p 281), “remains unmoved and is impassive and unchangeable, is neither sensation nor does it comprehend anything
- HoP 2",175
7029,"For not until they have been changed and determined by the invasion of the actual does sensation show forth things”176 The sensation of Epicurus is an existent, but there is in it no principle of judgment, because each sensation is independent
- HoP 2",251
7030,"But sensation must be analyzed in accordance with the two points of view there present, for as the soul is therein, determined, so likewise is that which determines determined by the energy of the conscious subject
- HoP 2",222
7031,"Because I, as a living being, have sensation, a change in my consciousness takes place, which means that I am determined from without and from within
- HoP 2",157
7032,"Consequently the criterion cannot be a simple determinateness, for it is really an implicit relationship in which two moments, sensation and thought, must be distinguished
- HoP 2",179
7033,"Since to Carneades sensation is merely what comes first, he then says: “The criterion is thus to be sought for in the affection of the soul by actuality” For it is only in the mean between the energy of the soul and that of outward things that the criterion can fall
- HoP 2",274
7034,"A determinate content of sensation such as this, which is at the same time again determined through consciousness, this passivity and activity of consciousness, this third something, Carneades called the conception which constituted to the Stoics the content of thought
- HoP 2",277
7035,"Respecting this criterion, he says: “This being determined must, however, be an indication both of itself and of the apparent, or of the thing through which it is affected; this affection is none other than the conception
- HoP 2",229
7036,"Hence in life the conception is something which presents both itself and the other
- HoP 2",90
7037,"If we see something, the sight has an affection, and it no longer is just as it was before seeing
- HoP 2",105
7038,"Through an alteration such as this there arise in us two things: first change itself, ie the ordinary conception” (the subjective side) “and then that which change produced, what is seen” (the objective)
- HoP 2",211
7039,"We now expect a development of this opposition; but Carneades passes into the region of empiricism without giving this further development
- HoP 2",146
7041,"Although I am convinced, it is still my conception merely, even if men think they have said something by saying that they have this conviction
- HoP 2",150
7042,"They likewise say that insight or objective knowledge is still only the conviction of difference, but really the content is in its nature universal
- HoP 2",155
7043,"Finally, “because no conception is a criterion, neither can thought be taken as such, for this depends on conception”—and must hence be just as uncertain as it is
- HoP 2",170
7044,"Philosophic culture of those times remained at this standpoint, and in modern times Reinhold also arrived at the same result
- HoP 2",132
7047,"In this way it has two relationships—on the one hand to the object, and, on the other, to that which forms the conception
- HoP 2",129
7050,"This is quite a correct determination, which everywhere appears in the universal
- HoP 2",88
7051,"Nothing is seen or said alone, for a number of circumstances stand in connection with it
- HoP 2",96
7052,"If none of such circumstances make us uncertain or cause us to think the others false, but when all uniformly agree, the conception is the more convincing”182 Thus when a conception is in harmony with the manifold circumstances in which it stands, it is secure
- HoP 2",268
7053,"A cord may be thought to be a snake, but all the circumstances of the same have not been considered
- HoP 2",107
7054,"Thus he who judges as well as what is judged and that according to which judgment is given, are subject to investigations
- HoP 2",129
7055,"In fact, the truth is only in thinking knowledge, and if Carneades does not exhaust all that can be said of the nature of this knowledge, he still has rightly emphasized an essential moment in it, the opening out and the judging movements of the moments
- HoP 2",261
7056,"In the New Academy we see the subjective side of conviction expressed, or the belief that not the truth as truth, but its manifestation, or really what it is to the conception, is present in consciousness
- HoP 2",212
7057,"Thus only subjective certainty is demanded; of the truth nothing more is said, for only what is relative in respect of consciousness is considered
- HoP 2",154
7058,"Just as the Academic principle limited itself to the subjective act of the convincing conception, so likewise did the Stoics really place implicit existence in thought, and Epicurus in perception; but they called this the truth
- HoP 2",235
7059,"The Academicians, on the contrary, set it up against the truth, and asserted that it is not the existent as such
- HoP 2",120
7060,"They had thus a consciousness that the implicit really has the moment of consciousness in it, and that without this it cannot exist; this was also a fundamental principle to the former, but they were not conscious of it
- HoP 2",227
7062,"Now, if this Academic standpoint is driven to its ultimate limit, it amounts to this, that everything is clearly for consciousness alone, and that the form of an existent, and of the knowledge of existence, also quite disappears as form; this, however, is Scepticism
- HoP 2",274
7064,"Thus the Academy had no longer any fixed subsistence, but hereby really passed into Scepticism, which merely asserted a subjective belief in truth, so that all objective truth has really been denied
- HoP 2",206
7065,"Scepticism completed the theory of the subjectivity of all knowledge by the fact that in knowledge it universally substituted for Being the expression appearance
- HoP 2",169
7066,"Now this Scepticism undoubtedly appears to be something most impressive, to which great respect is due from man
- HoP 2",119
7067,"In all times as now, it has been held to be the most formidable, and, indeed, the invincible opponent of Philosophy, because it signifies the art of dissolving all that is determinate, and showing it in its nullity
- HoP 2",222
7068,"Thus it might almost appear as though it were held to be in itself invincible, and as though the only difference in convictions were whether the individual decided for it or for a positive, dogmatic philosophy
- HoP 2",217
7069,"Its result undoubtedly is the disintegration of the truth, and, consequently, of all content, and thus perfect negation
- HoP 2",127
7070,"The invincibility of Scepticism must undoubtedly be granted, only, however, in a subjective sense as regards the individual, who may keep to the point of view of taking no notice of Philosophy, and only asserting the negative
- HoP 2",233
7072,"Certainly if we were merely to escape from it, it would not in reality have been defeated, for on its side it would remain where it was, and in possession of the field
- HoP 2",175
7073,"For positive philosophy allows Scepticism to exist beside it; Scepticism, on the other hand, encroaches upon the domain of positive philosophy, for Scepticism has power to overcome the other, while positive philosophy cannot do the same to it
- HoP 2",250
7074,"If anyone actually desires to be a Sceptic, he cannot be convinced, or be brought to a positive philosophy,185 any more than he who is paralyzed in all his limbs can be made to stand
- HoP 2",190
7075,"Scepticism is, in fact, such paralysis—an incapacity for truth which can only reach certainty of self, and not of the universal, remaining merely in the negative, and in individual self-consciousness
- HoP 2",207
7076,"To keep oneself in individuality depends on the will of the individual; no one can prevent a man from doing this, because no one can possibly drive another out of nothing
- HoP 2",178
7077,"But thinking Scepticism is quite different; it is the demonstration that all that is determinate and finite is unstable
- HoP 2",127
7078,"As to this, positive philosophy may have the consciousness that it has the negation to Scepticism in itself; thus it does not oppose it, nor is it outside of it, for Scepticism is a moment in it
- HoP 2",202
7079,"But this is true in such a way that this philosophy comprehends in itself the negative in its truth, as it is not present in Scepticism
- HoP 2",143
7080,"The relation of Scepticism to Philosophy is further this, that the former is the dialectic of all that is determinate
- HoP 2",125
7081,"The finitude of all conceptions of truth can be shown, for they contain in themselves a negation, and consequently a contradiction
- HoP 2",138
7082,"The ordinary universal and infinite is not exalted over this, for the universal which confronts the particular, the indeterminate which opposes the determinate, the infinite which confronts the finite, each form only the one side, and, as such, are only a determinate
- HoP 2",275
7083,"Scepticism is similarly directed against the thought of the ordinary understanding which makes determinate differences appear to be ultimate and existent
- HoP 2",161
7084,"But the logical Notion is itself this dialectic of Scepticism, for this negativity which is characteristic of Scepticism likewise belongs to the true knowledge of the Idea
- HoP 2",179
7086,"It makes the mistake of thinking that this negation is likewise a determinate affirmative content in itself; for it is, as the negation of negation, the self-relating negativity or infinite affirmation
- HoP 2",209
7087,"This, put quite abstractly, is the relation of Philosophy to Scepticism
- HoP 2",79
7088,"The Idea, as abstract Idea, is the quiescent and inert; it only is in truth in as far as it grasps itself as living
- HoP 2",123
7089,"This occurs because it is implicitly dialectic, in order to abrogate that inert quiescence, and to change itself
- HoP 2",120
7090,"But if the philosophic Idea is thus implicitly dialectic, it is not so in a contingent manner
- HoP 2",101
7091,"Scepticism, on the contrary, exercises its dialectic contingently, for just as the material comes up before it, it shows in the same that implicitly it is negative
- HoP 2",171
7092,"The older Scepticism must further be distinguished from the modern, and it is only with the former that we have to do, for it alone is of a true, profound nature; the modern more resembles Epicureanism
- HoP 2",209
7093,"Thus Schulze of Göttingen has in recent times boasted of his Scepticism; he wrote an “Ænesidemus” in order thus to compare himself with that sceptic; and in other works, too, he put forward Scepticism in opposition to Leibnitz and to Kant
- HoP 2",246
7095,"Schulze and others make it fundamental that we must consider sensuous Being, what is given to us by sensuous consciousness, to be true; all else must be doubted
- HoP 2",168
7096,"What we think is ultimate, the facts of consciousness
- HoP 2",61
7097,"The older sceptics, indeed, allowed that men must direct their actions in accordance with this last, but to assert it to be the truth did not occur to them
- HoP 2",163
7099,"But that is not even a peasants’ philosophy, for they know that all earthly things are transient, and that thus their Being is as good as their non-being
- HoP 2",161
7100,"Modern Scepticism is the subjectivity and vanity of consciousness, which is undoubtedly invincible, not, however, to science and truth, but merely to itself, this subjectivity
- HoP 2",183
7101,"For it goes no further than saying, “This is held by me to be true, my feeling, my heart is ultimate to me” But here certainty is alone in question, and not truth; and, indeed, this nowadays is no longer called Scepticism
- HoP 2",229
7102,"But the conviction of this individual subject expresses nothing at all, however high the matter which we talk of is supposed to be
- HoP 2",138
7104,"The result of the older Scepticism is indeed the subjectivity of knowledge only, but this is founded on an elaborately thought out annihilation of everything which is held to be true and existent, so that everything is made transient
- HoP 2",241
7105,"According to this, the function of Scepticism is wrongly termed the inculcation of proneness to doubt; nor can we translate σκέψις by Doubt, if Scepticism was also called by Sextus (Pyrrh
- HoP 2",195
7106,"Doubt, however, is only uncertainty, irresolution, indecision, the thought which is opposed to something held to be valid
- HoP 2",129
7107,"Doubt proceeds from the fact of there being two; it is a passing to and fro between two or more points of view, so that we neither rest at the one nor the other—and yet we ought to remain at one point or another
- HoP 2",219
7108,"Thus doubt in man is quite likely to involve a rending asunder of mind and spirit; it gives unrest and brings unhappiness with it; doubts, for instance, arise respecting the immortality of the soul and the existence of God
- HoP 2",230
7110,"Such doubt is said to betoken a keen and sharp-witted thinker, but it is only vanity and simple verbiage, or a feebleness that can never arrive at anything
- HoP 2",163
7111,"This Scepticism has nowadays entered into our life, and it thus makes itself of account as this universal negativity
- HoP 2",124
7112,"But the older Scepticism does not doubt, being certain of untruth, and indifferent to the one as to the other; it does not only flit to and fro with thoughts that leave the possibility that something may still be true, but it proves with certainty the untruth of all
- HoP 2",274
7113,"Or its doubt to it is certainty which has not the intention of attaining to truth, nor does it leave this matter undecided, for it is completely at a point, and perfectly decided, although this decision is not truth to it
- HoP 2",229
7114,"This certainty of itself thus has as result the rest and security of the mind in itself, which is not touched with any grief, and of which doubt is the direct opposite
- HoP 2",175
7115,"This is the standpoint of the imperturbability of Scepticism
- HoP 2",68
7116,"Now what has to be considered even before treating of Scepticism itself, is its external history
- HoP 2",104
7117,"As regards the origin of Scepticism the Sceptics say that it is very old, that is, if we take it in the quite indeterminate and universal sense, in so far as to say “Things are, but their Being is not true, for it likewise involves their non-being; or they are changeable
- HoP 2",279
7118,"For example, this day is to-day, but to-morrow is also to-day, &c; it is day now but night is also now, &c” Thus of what in this way is allowed to be a determinate, the opposite is also expressed
- HoP 2",203
7121,"The Sceptics have also presented this position in an historic way, and they show that even Homer was a sceptic, because he speaks of the same things in opposite ways
- HoP 2",173
7124,"As philosophic consciousness Scepticism is consequently of later date
- HoP 2",77
7126,"The history of Scepticism, properly so called, is usually commenced with Pyrrho as being its founder; and from him the names Pyrrhonism and Pyrrhonic are derived
- HoP 2",169
7128,"As to the events of Pyrrho’s life, they appear to be as much a matter of doubt as his doctrine; for they are without any connection, and little is known for certain concerning them
- HoP 2",188
7129,"Pyrrho lived in the time of Aristotle and was born at Elis
- HoP 2",66
7130,"I shall not give the names of his instructors; Anaxarchus, a disciple of Democritus, is specially mentioned amongst them
- HoP 2",128
7131,"We cannot discover where he really lived, for the most part at least
- HoP 2",76
7132,"As a proof of how very much he was esteemed during his life, it is said that his native town chose him as head priest, and the town of Athens gave him the right of citizenship
- HoP 2",183
7133,"It is finally stated that he accompanied Alexander the Great in his journey to Asia; and that there he had considerable dealings with magicians and Brahmins
- HoP 2",164
7134,"We are told that Alexander had him put to death because he desired the death of a Persian satrap; and this fate befel him in his ninetieth year
- HoP 2",151
7135,"If all this is to be accepted, since Alexander spent between twelve and fourteen years in Asia, Pyrrho must at the earliest have set out on his travels in his seventy-eighth year
- HoP 2",186
7136,"Pyrrho does not appear to have come forward as a public teacher, but merely to have left behind him individual friends who had been educated by him
- HoP 2",155
7140,"It is also very clear that such stories are simply invented with the object of ridiculing the sceptical philosophy, by following out its principle to such extreme consequences
- HoP 2",183
7143,"Dr Paul collected them in an essay, but in it much is given that is meaningless
- HoP 2",87
7144,"Goethe and Schiller certainly show more capacity in works of a similar nature
- HoP 2",85
7146,"Ænesidemus was the first to reawaken Scepticism; he was of Cnossus in Crete, and lived in Cicero’s time in Alexandria,190 which soon began to compete with Athens for the honour of being the seat of Philosophy and the sciences
- HoP 2",233
7147,"Subsequently, when the Academy lost itself in Scepticism, we see the latter, from which the former is all the same only separated by a thin partition, taking up a position of predominance as representing the purely negative point of view
- HoP 2",245
7150,"He was a physician, and that he was an empirical physician, who did not act according to theory but in accordance with what appears, his name tells us
- HoP 2",158
7152,"There were in all eleven books, six of which are actually directed against mathematicians, but the other five against the philosophers
- HoP 2",142
7153,"The distinction between the Academy and Scepticism was a matter as to which the Sceptics exercised themselves much
- HoP 2",122
7155,"The Sceptics are, on the whole, very careful to distinguish their own from other systems
- HoP 2",96
7156,"I c 1, §§ 1-4) distinguishes three philosophies: “He who seeks an object must either find it or deny that it can be found, or persevere in the search
- HoP 2",157
7157,"Now the same holds good with philosophic investigations; some assert that they have found the truth; others deny that it can be grasped; a third set are still engaged in search
- HoP 2",184
7158,"The first, like Aristotle, Epicurus, the Stoics, and others, are the so-called Dogmatists; those who assert incomprehensibility are the Academicians; the Sceptics still continue to seek
- HoP 2",193
7160,"I c 7, § 13; c 10, §§ 19-20) says: “The Sceptic does not dogmatize, but only assents to the affections into which he is impelled, not of his own will, by the conceptions; thus, if for example, he is warm or cold, he will certainly not say, I seem not to be cold or warm
- HoP 2",277
7161,"But if it be asked if the subject is as it appears, we allow appearance (φαίνεσθαι); yet we do not investigate the thing that appears, but only the predicate predicate (ὃ λέγεται)194 expressing its appearance
- HoP 2",216
7162,"Thus, whether anything is sweet or not, we consider only as regards the Notion Notion (ὄσον ἐπὶ τῷ λόγῳ); but that is not what appears, but what is said of what appears
- HoP 2",176
7164,"According to Sextus they say (Pyrrh
- HoP 2",43
7165,"I c 7, § 14; c 28, § 206): “The Sceptic makes use of his propositions—for example, determine nothing (οὐδὲν ὁρίζειν), not the more (οὐδὲν μᾶλλον), nothing is true, &c—not as if they really did exist
- HoP 2",206
7166,"For he believes, for instance, that the proposition, everything is false, asserts that itself as well as the others is false, and consequently limits it (συμπεριγράφει)
- HoP 2",176
7168,"Pure Scepticism merely makes this objection to the Academy, that it is still impure
- HoP 2",91
7169,"Sextus says (Pyrrh
- HoP 2",26
7170,"I c 33, §§ 226-233): “But clearly they differ from us in the judgment of good and evil
- HoP 2",94
7172,"But this is nothing more than a mere form, for the content immediately destroys that which in form appears to be an assertion
- HoP 2",133
7173,"If we say: “Something is a good, thought assents to it,” and then ask, “But what is the good to which thought assents?” the content here is that it should not assent
- HoP 2",173
7174,"Hence the form is, “It is a good,” but the content is that nothing should be held to be good or true
- HoP 2",108
7175,"Thus the Sceptics also assert this: To the Sceptics “all conceptions are alike in trustworthiness or untrustworthiness in relation to the ground,” to truth
- HoP 2",163
7177,"Hence the same result is obtained, that we have already seen in systems of philosophy immediately preceding this
- HoP 2",120
7178,"Thus as soon as anything is held to be truth to self-consciousness, we find the result that to self-consciousness this truth is the universal reality, passing beyond itself, and in regard to this, self-consciousness esteems itself as nothing
- HoP 2",249
7179,"But this external and determinate truth, as finite, is not implicitly existent, so that its necessity is to vacillate and give way
- HoP 2",138
7180,"Then when this security disappears, self-consciousness itself loses its equilibrium, and becomes driven hither and thither in unrest, fear and anguish; for its stability and rest is the permanence of its existence and truth
- HoP 2",231
7182,"I c 6, § 12, c 12, §§ 25-30), “is the hope of attaining to security
- HoP 2",75
7185,"For if he holds anything to be good or evil by nature, he never is at rest, whether it be that he does not possess what he holds to be good, or that he thinks himself vexed and assailed by natural evil
- HoP 2",209
7186,"But he who is undecided respecting that which is good and beautiful in nature, neither shuns nor seeks anything with zeal; and thus he remains unmoved
- HoP 2",158
7187,"What happened to the painter Apelles, befalls the Sceptic
- HoP 2",65
7190,"But if to Scepticism existence was only a manifestation or conception, it was yet esteemed by it as that in respect to which the Sceptics directed their conduct, both in what they did, and what they left undone
- HoP 2",218
7192,"Thus the universal method of Scepticism was, as Sextus Empiricus puts it (Pyrrh
- HoP 2",87
7194,"From this the suspension of judgment (ἐποχή) results, in conformity with which we select and posit nothing, and thereby complete freedom from all mental emotion is attained
- HoP 2",180
7195,"The principle of Scepticism is thus found in the proposition that each reason is confronted by another, which holds equally good
- HoP 2",136
7197,"In as far as Scepticism limits itself to this, it is a moment in Philosophy itself, which last, having an attitude of negativity in relation to both, only recognizes them as true in their abrogation
- HoP 2",206
7198,"But Scepticism thinks that it reaches further; it sets up a pretension of venturing against the speculative Idea and conquering it; Philosophy, however, since Scepticism itself is present in it as a moment, rather overcomes it (supra, p 330)
- HoP 2",249
7199,"As far as what is sensuous and what is thought in their separation are concerned, it certainly may conquer, but the Idea is neither the one nor the other, and it does not touch on the rational at all
- HoP 2",207
7200,"The perpetual misunderstanding which those who do not know the nature of the Idea are under concerning Scepticism, is that they think that the truth necessarily falls into the one form or the other, and is thus either a determinate Notion or a determinate Being
- HoP 2",269
7201,"Against the Notion as Notion, ie against the absolute Notion, Scepticism does not in any way proceed; the absolute Notion is rather its weapon of defence, though Scepticism has no consciousness of this
- HoP 2",209
7202,"But though, according to this, Scepticism always expresses itself as if everything were in appearance only, the Sceptics go further than those who support the newer and purely formal idealism
- HoP 2",199
7203,"For they deal with content, and demonstrate of all content that it is either experienced by the senses or thought, and consequently that it has something in opposition to it
- HoP 2",181
7204,"Thus they show in the same thing the contradiction that exists, so that of everything that is presented the opposite also holds good
- HoP 2",140
7205,"This is the objective element in Scepticism in its manifestation, and that through which it is not subjective idealism
- HoP 2",126
7206,"I c 13, §§ 32, 33) says: “Thus, for instance, the sensuous is set against the sensuous by our being reminded of the fact that the same tower when looked at near is square and when regarded in the distance looks round;” and hence the one assertion is as good as the other
- HoP 2",278
7207,"This, indeed, is a very trivial example, but its interest lies in the thought that is present in it
- HoP 2",107
7209,"For it is frozen water, but water has no colour and hence is black; consequently snow must be the same
- HoP 2",110
7210,"We must now consider further the method in which the Sceptics proceed, and it consists in this, that they have brought the universal principle that each definite assertion has to be set over against its ‘other,’ into certain forms, not propositions
- HoP 2",256
7213,"Now since what sort of thoughts reveal themselves is a matter of contingency, the manner and mode of grasping them is contingent likewise; for in one the contradiction appears thus and in another otherwise
- HoP 2",213
7216,"Now since the sceptical doctrine consists in the art of demonstrating contradictions through these tropes, we only require to elucidate these modes
- HoP 2",155
7217,"The Sceptics themselves, like Sextus, for example (Pyrrh
- HoP 2",64
7218,"From a specification of these it will be shown that the earlier are directed against the ordinary consciousness generally and belong to a thought of little culture, to a consciousness which has sensuous existence immediately before it
- HoP 2",242
7219,"For they proceed against what we call common belief in the immediate truth of things, and refute it in a manner which is immediate likewise, not through the Notion but through the existence which is opposed to it
- HoP 2",220
7220,"In their enumeration, too, there is this same absence of the Notion
- HoP 2",75
7224,"But this Scepticism was really far from holding things of immediate certainty to be true; thus it actually stands in contrast to modern Scepticism, in which it is believed that what is in our immediate consciousness, or indeed, all that is sensuous, is a truth (supra, pp
- HoP 2",279
7225,"As distinguished from this, the older Scepticism, the modes of which we would now consider further, is directed against the reality of things
- HoP 2",149
7227,"From all alike, in relation to immediate knowledge, is the insecurity demonstrated of that of which we say “it is” Sextus Empiricus (Pyrrh
- HoP 2",146
7228,"I c 14, § 38) even remarks, that “all the tropes may be summed up in three: the one is the judging subject; the other that respecting which the judgment is made; the third that which contains both sides”—the relation of subject and object
- HoP 2",246
7229,"If thought is developed further, it embraces things in these more general determinations
- HoP 2",96
7231,"For instance, the jaundiced patient sees as yellow what to others appears white,” and as green, what to the latter seems blue
- HoP 2",133
7232,"But if we say “That is,” we mean something fixed, maintaining itself under all conditions; whereas in opposition to this the Sceptics show that everything is variable
- HoP 2",174
7234,"But certainly it is implied in this that the first sensuous universality is not true universality, because it is one immediate and unknown; and in it as sensuous existence, its non-universality is rightly demonstrated within itself through another universality
- HoP 2",268
7235,"As against the statement “This is blue because I see it as such,” which clearly makes sight the ground of its being asserted to be blue, it is quite fair to point to another who has immediate perception of the object and for whom it is not blue
- HoP 2",252
7236,"The second trope, the diversitude of mankind in reference to feelings and conditions, amounts very much to the same thing as in the first case
- HoP 2",150
7237,"In respect to difference in constitution of body, the Sceptics discover many idiosyncrasies
- HoP 2",99
7239,"Because such great bodily differences are present amongst men, and the body is the image of the soul, men must have a diversity of mind likewise and give the most contradictory judgments, so that no one can know whom to believe
- HoP 2",235
7241,"But a belief like this, that is ready to believe anything, is, as a matter of fact, incapable of understanding what is said; it is an immediate acceptance of an immediate proposition
- HoP 2",190
7242,"For it did not demand the reason; but the reason is, in the first place, the mediation and the meaning of the words of the immediate proposition
- HoP 2",152
7243,"Diversitude in men is really something which now likewise appears in other forms
- HoP 2",88
7244,"It is said that men differ in regard to taste, religion, &c; that religion must be left for each to decide for himself; that each, from a standpoint of his own, must settle how things are to be regarded as far as religion is concerned
- HoP 2",242
7245,"The consequence of this is that in regard to religion there is nothing objective or true, everything ends in subjectivity, and the result is indifference to all truth
- HoP 2",174
7246,"For then there is no longer a church; each man has a church and a liturgy of his own, each has his own religion
- HoP 2",119
7248,"If the principle of the Stoics, as it is in its immediacy, holds good, the opposite principle, that of the Epicureans, has just as much truth, and holds equally good
- HoP 2",173
7249,"In this way, when it is said that some particular philosophy asserts and maintains certain propositions, the greatest diversity is undoubtedly to be found
- HoP 2",162
7250,"For here we have the talk which we censured earlier (Vol
- HoP 2",64
7253,"Philosophy is quite the reverse of this immediacy of a proposition, because in that the very knowledge that is essential is not taken into account; hence such men see everything in a philosophy excepting Philosophy itself, and this is overlooked
- HoP 2",253
7254,"However different the philosophic systems may be, they are not as different as white and sweet, green and rough; for they agree in the fact that they are philosophies, and this is what is overlooked
- HoP 2",206
7255,"But as regards the difference in philosophies, we must likewise remark upon this immediate validity accorded to them, and upon the form, that the essence of Philosophy is expressed in an immediate manner
- HoP 2",211
7256,"As regards this ‘is’ the trope undoubtedly does its work, for all tropes proceed against the ‘is,’ but the truth is all the time not this dry ‘is,’ but genuine process
- HoP 2",175
7258,"The consciousness is required that the unthinking description which ascribes existence to blue, square, &c, one after the other, does not exhaust and express the Being of the thing; they are only predicates which do not express the thing as subject
- HoP 2",256
7259,"It is always important to keep in mind that the different senses grasp the same thing in contradictory ways, for by this the nullity of sensuous certainty is revealed

7276,"If it is different, it again is a relative
- HoP 2",50
7277,"That is to say, what is different is related to something, for it is set forth in relation to that from which it is distinguished” Relativity, generally, is present in what is absolutely predicated, for relationship is a relationship in itself and not to another

7278,"Relationship contains opposition: what is in relation to another is on the one hand independent on its own account, but on the other, because it is in relationship, it is likewise not independent

- HoP 2",132
7287,"As regards the ordinary understanding respecting the validity of this and that maxim, eg that the son has to pay the debts of his father, the ultimate and indeed only ground lies in its being said that this is true in its immediacy, for it holds good as law or custom

7289,"The natural man has no consciousness of the presence of opposites; he lives quite unconsciously in his own particular way, in conformity with the morality of his town, without ever having reflected on the fact that he practises this morality

- HoP 2",59
7305,"The first trope is the diversitude in opinions (ἀπὸ τῆς διαφωνίας), and that not among animals and men, but expressly among philosophers; of this matter we have just spoken above (pp
- HoP 2",190
7306,"Sextus, and an Epicurean quoted by Cicero (Vol
- HoP 2",54
7307,"I p 16), adduce the manifold nature of dogmas, and from this the conclusion is drawn that the one has just as much support as the other
- HoP 2",143
7309,"This diversitude in philosophic opinion is said to be an invincible weapon against Philosophy; but the category of difference is very barren, and we have said in the introduction (Vol
- HoP 2",191
7310,"The Idea of Philosophy is to all philosophers one and the same, even if they themselves are not aware of it; but those who speak so much of this diversity know as little about it
- HoP 2",186
7311,"The true difference is not a substantial one, but a difference in the different stages of development; and if the difference implies a one-sided view, as it does with the Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics, in their totality undoubtedly we first reach truth
- HoP 2",263
7313,"Consequently no permanent ground can be pointed out, for each continues to press further and further back, and yet finally a cessation must be made
- HoP 2",155
7314,"In more recent times many have plumed themselves on this trope, and, in fact, it is as regards the understanding and the so-called syllogism (supra, pp
- HoP 2",159
7315,"For if deduction from reasons is made the power of knowledge, we must, on the other hand, remember that by so doing we have premises which are quite ungrounded
- HoP 2",167
7316,"It is that what is maintained shows itself as it appears, partly merely in relation to the judging subject and partly to other things, but not as it is in itself by nature
- HoP 2",179
7317,"If the dogmatist has the right to pre-suppose an axiom as unproved, the sceptic has equally the right, or, if we choose to say so, equally no right, to pre-suppose the opposite as unproved
- HoP 2",196
7318,"One is as good as the other
- HoP 2",35
7319,"Thus all definitions are pre-suppositions
- HoP 2",49
7320,"For instance, Spinoza pre-supposes definitions of the infinite, of substance, of attribute, &c; and the rest follows consistently from them

7321,"Nowadays men prefer to give assurances and speak of facts of consciousness
- HoP 2",82
7322,"To the question, “What is the ground of the phenomenon?” the reply is “Power,” but this is itself merely deduced from the moments of the phenomenon
- HoP 2",155
7323,"Now Sextus shows (Pyrrh
- HoP 2",31
7325,"This is the first trope
- HoP 2",31
7326,"If not, we must withhold our judgment
- HoP 2",45
7327,"But if it is to be solved, the question is, ‘How shall we decide?’” What is to contain the criterion, the standard, the implicit?
- HoP 2",137
7328,"The case is, however, similar if what is thought is the criterion, or if the implicit is made to rest on it
- HoP 2",115
7329,"This reason is, however, something thought likewise, and it again requires a reason; thus this, too, passes into the infinite” From effect men thus reach cause; nevertheless this too is not original, but is itself an effect; and so on
- HoP 2",242
7330,"But if men thus progress into infinitude, they have no first original ground to stand on, for what is accepted as first cause is itself merely effect; and since they merely progress continually, it is implied that no ultimate is posited
- HoP 2",244
7331,"The false belief that this progression is a true category, is also to be found in Kant and Fichte; but there is really no true ultimate, or, what is the same, no true first
- HoP 2",180
7332,"The understanding represents infinite progression as something great; but its contradiction is that men speak of a first cause and it is then shown that it is only an effect
- HoP 2",181
7333,"Men only attain to the contradiction and constant repetition of the same, but not to the solution of it, and consequently to the true prius
- HoP 2",147
7334,"In this way each would be founded without there having been a progression into infinitude; but then that which founds would also be that which is founded, and there would merely be a passing from one to the other
- HoP 2",220
7335,"Thus, in the third place, this falls into the trope of Reciprocity, in which, however, there is no more than there was before any true foundation
- HoP 2",153
7336,"For in it each merely exists through the other, neither is really set forth absolutely, but each is the implicit only for the other, and this is self-abrogation
- HoP 2",168
7337,"But if an assumption such as this were to be allowed, it would also be legitimate for anyone to assume the contrary
- HoP 2",123
7339,"Everything, however, then, comes round to this, that because the ‘I’ is absolute, the ‘not-I’ cannot be absolute
- HoP 2",120
7341,"But as it is absurd to do so, so also is the other absurd
- HoP 2",65
7342,"Men set to work in the finite sciences in a similar way
- HoP 2",63
7343,"But when, as in a dogmatism like this, a man asserts his right of pre-supposing something, every other man has equally the right of pre-supposing something
- HoP 2",163
7344,"Consequently the modern immediate revelation of the subject now appears
- HoP 2",79
7345,"It does no good for any man to affirm, for example, that he finds in his consciousness that God exists; since anyone has the right to say that he finds in his consciousness that God does not exist
- HoP 2",204
7347,"The same holds good with what is thought; as the universal object of thought it likewise has the form of being something for another
- HoP 2",140
7348,"If we sum this up in a general way, the determinate, whether it is existent or thought, is (α) really, as determinate, the negative of another, ie it is related to another and exists for the same, and is thus in relationship; in this everything is really exhausted
- HoP 2",272
7349,"And for the reason that I really again consider this universal as a determinate, it is conditioned by another like the one that goes before, and so on into infinity
- HoP 2",172
7350,"And if the universal as the basis has its reality in the existent, and this existent its reality in the universal, this forms the Reciprocity whereby what in themselves are opposites mutually establish one another
- HoP 2",221
7351,"Or we might say more shortly that the deficiency in all metaphysics of the understanding lies partly in (α) the Demonstration, by which it falls into the infinite; and partly in (β) the Hypotheses, which constitute an immediate knowledge
- HoP 2",245
7352,"These tropes thus form an effective weapon against the philosophy of the ordinary understanding, and the Sceptics directed them with great acuteness, sometimes against the common acceptation of things, and sometimes against principles of philosophic reflection
- HoP 2",268
7354,"To the Sceptics, the Notion of dogmatic philosophy is in effect that something is asserted as the implicit; it is thus opposed to idealism by the fact of its maintaining that an existence is the absolute
- HoP 2",211
7355,"But there is a misunderstanding or a formal understanding in considering that all philosophy that is not Scepticism is Dogmatism
- HoP 2",136
7356,"Dogmatism, as the Sceptics quite correctly describe it, consists in the assertion that something determinate, such as ‘I’ or ‘Being,’ ‘Thought’ or ‘Sensation,’ is the truth
- HoP 2",180
7357,"In the talk about idealism, to which dogmatism has been opposed, just as many mistakes have been made, and misunderstandings taken place
- HoP 2",144
7359,"By idealism that is likewise held to be dogmatism in which, as is the case in Plato and Spinoza, the absolute has been made the unity of self-consciousness and existence, and not self-consciousness opposed to existence
- HoP 2",226
7361,"But though its principle can be given the form of a proposition, to the Idea what pertains to the proposition as such is not essential, and the content is of such a nature that it really abrogates this immediate existence, as we find with the Academicians
- HoP 2",263
7362,"As a matter of fact, that which is now called a proposition, absolutely requires a mediation or a ground; for it is an immediate determinate that has another proposition in opposition to it, which last is again of a similar nature, and so on into infinitude
- HoP 2",265
7363,"Consequently, each, as being a proposition, is the union of two moments between which there is an inherent difference, and whose union has to be mediated
- HoP 2",161
7364,"Now dogmatic philosophy, which has this way of representing one principle in a determinate proposition as a fundamental principle, believes that it is therefore universal, and that the other is in subordination to it
- HoP 2",224
7365,"And undoubtedly this is so
- HoP 2",34
7366,"But at the same time, this its determinateness rests in the fact that it is only universal; hence such a principle is always conditioned, and consequently contains within it a destructive dialectic
- HoP 2",205
7367,"As against all these dogmatic philosophies, such criticism and idealism not excepted, the sceptical tropes possess the negative capacity of demonstrating that what the former maintain to be the implicit is not really so
- HoP 2",227
7368,"For implicitude such as this is a determinate, and cannot resist negativity, its abrogation
- HoP 2",99
7369,"To Scepticism is due the honour of having obtained this knowledge of the negative, and of having so definitely thought out the forms of negativity
- HoP 2",154
7370,"Scepticism does not operate by bringing forward what is called a difficulty, a possibility of representing the matter otherwise; that would merely indicate some sort of fancy which is contingent as regards this asserted knowledge
- HoP 2",237
7371,"Scepticism is not an empiric matter such as this, for it contains a scientific aim, its tropes turn on the Notion, the very essence of determinateness, and are exhaustive as regards the determinate
- HoP 2",205
7373,"These tropes are necessary contradictions into which the understanding falls; even in our time progression into infinitude and pre-supposition (immediate knowledge) are particularly common (supra, p 363)
- HoP 2",211
7374,"Now, speaking generally, this is the method of Scepticism, and it is most important
- HoP 2",91
7375,"Because the sceptical conscience demonstrates that in all that is immediately accepted there is nothing secure and absolute, the Sceptics have taken in hand all particular determinations of the individual sciences, and have shown that they are not fixed
- HoP 2",261
7377,"Sextus, for example, takes up the individual sciences concretely, thereby demonstrating much capacity for abstraction, and he shows in all their determinations the opposite of themselves
- HoP 2",194
7378,"Thus he sets the definitions of mathematics against one another, and that not externally, but as they are in themselves; he lays hold of the fact (adv
- HoP 2",158
7379,"On the one hand it is the negation of space, and, on the other, inasmuch as it is the limit of space, it touches space
- HoP 2",126
7380,"Thus this negation of space participates in space, itself occupies space, and thus it is in itself null, but at the same time it is also in itself a dialectic
- HoP 2",166
7381,"Scepticism has thus also treated of ideas which are, properly speaking, speculative, and demonstrated their importance; for the demonstration of the contradiction in the finite is an essential point in the speculatively philosophic method
- HoP 2",246
7382,"The two formal moments in this sceptical culture are firstly the power of consciousness to go back from itself, and to take as its object the whole that is present, itself and its operation included
- HoP 2",206
7383,"The second moment is to grasp the form in which a proposition, with whose content our consciousness is in any way occupied, exists
- HoP 2",138
7384,"An undeveloped consciousness, on the other hand, usually knows nothing of what is present in addition to the content
- HoP 2",124
7385,"For instance, in the judgment “This thing is one,” attention is paid only to the one and the thing, and not to the circumstance that here something, a determinate, is related to the one
- HoP 2",193
7386,"But this relation is the essential, and the form of the determinate; it is that whereby this house which is an individual, makes itself one with the universal that is different from it
- HoP 2",192
7387,"It is this logical element, ie the essential element, that Scepticism brings to consciousness, and on this it depends; an example of this is number, the one, as the hypothetical basis of arithmetic
- HoP 2",205
7388,"Scepticism does not attempt to give the thing, nor does it dispute as to whether it is thus or thus, but whether the thing itself is something; it grasps the essence of what is expressed, and lays hold of the whole principle of the assertion
- HoP 2",249
7389,"As to God, for example, the Sceptics do not inquire whether He has such and such qualities, but turn to what is most inward, to what lies at the ground of this conception, and they ask whether this has reality
- HoP 2",217
7390,"This is the way to penetrate to reality
- HoP 2",47
7391,"In these ways the operations of Scepticism are undoubtedly directed against the finite
- HoP 2",94
7392,"But however much force these moments of its negative dialectic may have against the properly-speaking dogmatic knowledge of the understanding, its attacks against the true infinite of the speculative Idea are most feeble and unsatisfactory
- HoP 2",247
7393,"For this last is in its nature nothing finite or determinate, it has not the one-sided character which pertains to the proposition, for it has the absolute negative in itself; in itself it is round, it contains this determinate and its opposite in their ideality in itself
- HoP 2",280
7397,"That is to say it comprehends it falsely and then proceeds to contradict it
- HoP 2",83
7398,"Or it first of all gives the infinite the itch in order to be able to scratch it
- HoP 2",88
7399,"The Scepticism of modern times, with which for crudity of comprehension and false teaching the old cannot compare, is specially noteworthy in this respect
- HoP 2",162
7400,"Even now what is speculative is transformed into something crude; it is possible to remain faithful to the letter, and yet to pervert the whole matter, because the identity of the determinate has been carried over to the speculative
- HoP 2",240
7402,"Now, here, according to the conception of the non-speculative sciences, it is placed in this dilemma: the principle is either an unproved hypothesis or demands a proof which in turn implies the principle
- HoP 2",211
7405,"The Notion is a self-movement, and not, as in a proposition, a desire to rest; nor is it true that the proof brings forward another ground or middle term and is another movement; for it has this movement in itself
- HoP 2",221
7406,"Sextus Empiricus (adv
- HoP 2",29
7407,"VII, 310-312), for example, thus reaches the speculative Idea regarding reason, which, as the thought of thought, comprehends itself, and is thus in its freedom at home with itself
- HoP 2",188
7408,"We saw this (pp
- HoP 2",23
7411,"But the relationship of whole and part is not a relationship of reason to itself, being much too unimportant, and quite unworthy of being brought into the speculative Idea
- HoP 2",179
7412,"In the second place Scepticism is wrong in allowing this relationship to hold good immediately, as it does in the ordinary and arid conception, where we make no objection to it
- HoP 2",184
7413,"But the whole is just the being opposed to itself
- HoP 2",57
7414,"On the one hand it is as whole simply identical with its parts, and, on the other hand, the parts are identical with the whole, since they together constitute the whole
- HoP 2",176
7415,"The self-comprehension of reason is just like the comprehension by the whole of all its parts, if it is taken in its real speculative significance; and only in this sense could this relationship be dealt with here
- HoP 2",221
7417,"Outside of the whole there thus undoubtedly remains another, namely itself as the manifold of its parts
- HoP 2",111
7420,"Hence this difference is not what remains good, but what has to be abrogated
- HoP 2",84
7421,"The general point of view adopted by self-consciousness in this second period, the attainment of the freedom of self-consciousness through thought, is common to all these philosophies
- HoP 2",191
7422,"In Scepticism we now find that reason has got so far that all that is objective, whether of Being or of the universal, has disappeared for self-consciousness
- HoP 2",165
7423,"The abyss of the self-consciousness of pure thought has swallowed up everything, and made entirely clear the basis of thought
- HoP 2",133
7424,"It not only has comprehended thought and outside of it a universe in its entirety, but the result, positively expressed, is that self-consciousness itself is reality
- HoP 2",173
7425,"External objectivity is not an objective existence nor a universal thought; for it merely is the fact that the individual consciousness exists, and that it is universal
- HoP 2",176
7426,"But though for us there is an object, yet this is for it no object, and thus it still has itself the mode of objectivity
- HoP 2",128
7427,"Scepticism deduces no result, nor does it express its negation as anything positive
- HoP 2",91
7430,"On another side its simple thought is the immovability of self-identity, but its reality, its unity with itself is something that is perfectly empty, and the actual filling in is any content that one chooses
- HoP 2",215
7431,"As this simplicity, and at the same time pure confusion, Scepticism is in fact the wholly self-abrogating contradiction
- HoP 2",127
7432,"For in it the mind has got so far as to immerse itself in itself as that which thinks; now it can comprehend itself in the consciousness of its infinitude as the ultimate
- HoP 2",178
7434,"Then because here the mind can only seek reconciliation and eudæmonism inwardly through cultured thought, and the whole aim of the world is merely the satisfaction of the individual, good can only be brought forth as individual work in each particular case
- HoP 2",264
7436,"This solitude of mind within itself is then truly Philosophy; but the thought is abstractly at home with itself as dead rigidity, and as to outward things it is passive
- HoP 2",176
7437,"If it moves it only moves while bearing with it a contempt of all distinctions
- HoP 2",86
7438,"Scepticism thus belongs to the decay both of Philosophy and of the world
- HoP 2",80
7439,"The stage next reached by self-consciousness is that it receives a consciousness respecting that which it has thus become, or its essential nature becomes its object
- HoP 2",173
7440,"Self-consciousness is to itself simple essence; there is for it no longer any other reality than this, which its self-consciousness is
- HoP 2",142
7441,"In Scepticism this reality is not yet an object to it, for to it its object is merely confusion
- HoP 2",103
7442,"Because it is consciousness, something is for it; in this opposition only the vanishing content is for the sceptical consciousness, without its having been comprehended in its simple permanence
- HoP 2",201
7443,"Its truth, however, is its immersion in self-consciousness, and the fact of self-consciousness becoming an object to itself
- HoP 2",131
7444,"Thus reality has indeed the form of a universal in existence or in thought, but in this its self-consciousness is really not a foreign thing as it is in Scepticism
- HoP 2",171
7445,"In the first place it is not simple as immediate and merely existent, a complete ‘other,’ as when we speak of the soul being simple; for this last is the simple negative that turns back out of movement, out of difference, as the universal, into itself
- HoP 2",259
7449,"With this third development, which is the concrete result of all that has gone before, an entirely new epoch begins
- HoP 2",123
7450,"Philosophy is now on quite a different footing, since, with the rejection of the criterion for subjective knowledge, finite principles in general also disappear; for it is with these that the criterion has to do
- HoP 2",219
7451,"This then is the form which Philosophy takes with the Neo-Platonists, and which is closely connected with the revolution which was caused in the world by Christianity
- HoP 2",174
7453,"But with this complete entering into and abiding within itself of infinite subjectivity, Philosophy had reached the standpoint at which self-consciousness knew itself in its thought to be the Absolute (Vol
- HoP 2",213
7456,"The manifold forms which this knowledge assumes do not belong to the history of Philosophy, but to the history of consciousness and culture
- HoP 2",147
7457,"This principle appears as a universal principle of justice, by which the individual man, in virtue of his existence, has absolute value as a universal being recognized by all
- HoP 2",182
7458,"Thus, as far as external politics are concerned, this is the period of the development of private rights relating to the property of individual persons
- HoP 2",159
7459,"But the character of Roman culture, under which this form of philosophy falls, was at the same time abstract universality (Vol
- HoP 2",134
7460,"Cicero, for example, shows, as few philosophers do, an utter want of appreciation of the state of affairs in his country
- HoP 2",128
7461,"Thus the world has in its existence separated into two parts; on the one side we have the atoms, private individuals, and on the other side a bond connecting them, though only externally, which, as power, had been relegated to one subject, the emperor
- HoP 2",259
7462,"The Roman power is thus the real Scepticism
- HoP 2",51
7465,"Or, in other words, we see here on the one hand the return to God, on the other hand the manifestation of God, as He comes before the human mind absolutely in His truth
- HoP 2",176
7466,"This forms the transition to the mind’s restoration, by the fact of thought, which had conceived itself only subjectively, now becoming objective to itself
- HoP 2",163
7467,"Thus in the Roman world the necessity became more and more keenly felt of forsaking the evil present, this ungodly, unrighteous, immoral world, and withdrawing into mind, in order here to seek what there no longer can be found
- HoP 2",234
7468,"For in the Greek world the joy of spiritual activity has flown away, and sorrow for the breach that has been made has taken its place
- HoP 2",141
7469,"These philosophies are thus not only moments in the development of reason, but also in that of humanity; they are forms in which the whole condition of the world expresses itself through thought
- HoP 2",202
7471,"Up to this time oracles had been given through the medium of trees, animals, &c, in which divine knowledge, as knowledge of the eternal, was not distinguished from knowledge of the contingent
- HoP 2",199
7472,"Now it no longer is the gods that work their wonders, but men, who, setting at defiance the necessities of nature, bring about in the same that which is inconsistent with nature as such
- HoP 2",193
7473,"To this belief in miracle, which is at the same time disbelief in present nature, there is thus allied a disbelief in the past, or a disbelief that history was just what it was
- HoP 2",184
7474,"All the actual history and mythology of Romans, Greeks, Jews, even single words and letters, receive a different meaning; they are inwardly broken asunder, having an inner significance which is their essence, and an empty literal meaning, which is their appearance
- HoP 2",272
7475,"Mankind living in actuality have here forgotten altogether how to see and to hear, and have indeed lost all their understanding of the present
- HoP 2",150
7476,"Sensuous truth is no longer accepted by them; they constantly deceive us, for they are incapable of comprehending what is real, since it has lost all meaning for their minds
- HoP 2",181
7477,"Others forsake the world, because in it they can now find nothing, the real they discover in themselves alone
- HoP 2",117
7478,"As all the gods meet together in one Pantheon, so all religions rush into one, all modes of representation are absorbed in one; it is this, that self-consciousness—an actual human being—is absolute existence
- HoP 2",215
7479,"It is to Rome that all these mysterious cults throng, but the real liberation of the spirit appeared in Christianity, for it is therein that its true nature is reached
- HoP 2",175
7480,"Now it is revealed to man what absolute reality is; it is a man, but not yet Man or self-consciousness in general
- HoP 2",121
7483,"It is this knowledge, but knows this knowledge not; it has merely an intuition of it, or knows it only immediately, not in thought
- HoP 2",138
7484,"Knowing it only immediately means that to the World-spirit this reality as spirit is doubtless absolute self-consciousness, but in existent immediacy it is an individual man
- HoP 2",181
7485,"As an immediacy of thought, absolute reality is immediate in self-consciousness, or only like an inward intuition, in the same way that we have pictures present in our mind
- HoP 2",180
7486,"The other form is that this concrete is grasped in a more abstract way, as the pure identity of thought, and thus there is lost to thought the point of self-hood pertaining to the concrete
- HoP 2",196
7487,"This aspect, expressed as absolute reality in the form of mind in conceiving thought, but yet as in some measure existing immediately in self-consciousness as absolute reality, comes under Philosophy
- HoP 2",207
7488,"But spirit, if complete in every aspect, must have also the natural aspect, which in this form of philosophy is still lacking
- HoP 2",133
7490,"Absolute Spirit implies eternal self-identical existence that is transformed into another and knows this to be itself; the unchangeable, which is unchangeable in as far as it always, from being something different, returns into itself
- HoP 2",242
7491,"It signifies the sceptical movement of consciousness, but in such a form that the transient objective element at the same time remains permanent, or in its permanence has the signification of self-consciousness
- HoP 2",218
7492,"In the Christian religion this spiritual reality was first of all represented as indicating that eternal reality becomes for itself something different, that it creates the world, which is posited purely as something different
- HoP 2",234
7493,"To this there is added later this moment, that the other element in itself is not anything different from eternal reality, but that eternal reality manifests itself therein
- HoP 2",180
7495,"The world recognizes itself in this absolute reality which becomes manifest; it is the world, therefore, which has returned into reality; and spirit is universal Spirit
- HoP 2",176
7499,"With the Stoics the universality of thought has a place, but it is opposed to sensation, to external existence
- HoP 2",118
7500,"Oriental universality is, on the contrary, entirely free; and the principle of universality, posited as particular, is Western Thought
- HoP 2",142
7502,"Even in the Pythagorean philosophy we found difference present as the Triad; then in Plato we saw the simple Idea of spirit as the unity of indivisible substance and other-being, though it was only as a compound of both
- HoP 2",227
7503,"That is the concrete, but only in simple moments, not in the comprehensive manner in which other-being is in general all reality of nature and of consciousness,—and the unity which has returned as this self-consciousness is not only a thought, but living God
- HoP 2",266
7504,"With Aristotle, finally, the concrete is ἐνέργεια, Thought which is its own object, the concrete
- HoP 2",104
7505,"Therefore although this philosophy is known as Neo-Pythagorean and Neo-Platonic, it may also be termed Neo-Aristotelian; for the Alexandrians studied Aristotle just as much as Plato, and valued both very highly, later on combining their philosophies in one unity
- HoP 2",270
7506,"But we must have a clearer grasp of the difference between this point of view and the earlier
- HoP 2",101
7507,"Already in the earlier philosophies we have seen, that νοῦς is the essence of the world, and similarly Aristotle comprehended the whole series of things endued with life and mind in such a way as to recognize the Notion to be the truth of these things
- HoP 2",259
7508,"In the case of the Stoics this unity, this system, was most definitely brought forward, while Aristotle rather followed up the particulars

7510,"Pantheism is the beginning of the elevation of spirit, in that it conceives everything in the world to be a life of the Idea
- HoP 2",132
7512,"But the concrete is the universal which makes itself particular, and in this making of itself particular and finite yet remains eternally at home with itself
- HoP 2",165
7513,"In Pantheism, on the contrary, the one universal substance merely makes itself finite, and thereby lowers itself
- HoP 2",120
7516,"The determination, the specialization, the reality of objectivity, must now be of such a nature that it shall be adequate to the absolute universal; the forms of the gods, as also natural forms and the forms which are known as duties, fail to be thus adequate
- HoP 2",267
7518,"The earlier efforts of thought towards objectivity constitute a passing into determinateness and finitude merely, and not into an objective world adequate to absolute existence
- HoP 2",184
7519,"The universal standpoint of the Neo-Platonic or Alexandrian philosophy now is from the loss of the world to produce a world which in its outwardness shall still remain an inward world, and thus a world reconciled; and this is the world of spirituality, which here begins
- HoP 2",278
7520,"Thus the fundamental Idea was Thought which is its own object, and which is therefore identical with its object, with what is thought; so that we have the one and the other, and the unity of both
- HoP 2",203
7521,"This concrete Idea has again come to the front, and in the development of Christianity, as thought also penetrated there, it became known as the Trinity; and this Idea is absolute reality
- HoP 2",195
7522,"This Idea did not develop directly from Plato and Aristotle, but took the circuitous path of Dogmatism
- HoP 2",110
7523,"Aristotle has thus comprehended the kingdom of Nature; and with Plato development is represented only in a loose multiplicity
- HoP 2",133
7525,"That was the function of Dogmatism, which was then dissolved by Scepticism
- HoP 2",82
7526,"The dissolution of all that is particular and finite, which constitutes the essence of the latter, was not taken in hand by Plato and Aristotle, and therefore the Idea was not posited by them as all-inclusive
- HoP 2",216
7527,"Now the contradiction is done away with, and Mind has attained to its negative rest
- HoP 2",91
7528,"The affirmative, on the other hand, is the repose of mind in itself, and to this freedom from all that is particular Mind now proceeds
- HoP 2",142
7529,"It is the knowledge of what Mind is in itself, after it has come to be reconciled in itself through the dissolution of all finality
- HoP 2",139
7530,"This eternal rest of Mind in itself now constitutes its object; it is aware of the fact, and strives to determine and develop it further by thought
- HoP 2",155
7531,"In this we likewise possess the principle of evolution, of free development; everything except Mind is only finite and transitory
- HoP 2",137

- HoP 2",79
7540,"This new standpoint, which from this time acquires an absolute interest, is therefore not a relation to external things, duties and the like; these are all determined, limited, they are not the all-embracing determination, as that is which has just been spoken of
- HoP 2",271
7541,"In this relation the mere turning of the subject on himself, this talk of the wise man
- HoP 2",94
7543,"This is the standpoint of reverencing and fearing God, so that by man’s turning to this his object, which stands before him free and firm, the object of the subject’s own freedom is attained

7545,"If we adopt this one-sided position, God is on the one side, and man in his freedom is on the other
- HoP 2",107
7546,"A freedom such as this, standing in contrast to the objective, a freedom in which man, as thinking self-consciousness, conceives as the absolute the relation of his pure inwardness to himself, is, however, only formally, and not concretely absolute

7547,"In so far then as the human will determines itself negatively towards the objective, we have the origin of sin, evil in contrast to the absolute Affirmative
- HoP 2",164
7549,"This relation to the world is then a relation to an ‘other,’ which thereby at first appears to be outside of God; but because this relation is His activity, the fact of having this relation in Himself is a moment of Himself

- HoP 2",173
7553,"In this manner, therefore, that which afterwards appears finite is yet produced by Him in Himself—the particular Ideas, the world in God Himself, the Divine world, where God has begun to separate Himself, and has His connection with the temporal world

7561,"The manner in which man represents to himself his relation to God is more particularly determined by the manner in which man represents to himself God
- HoP 2",158
7562,"Since God is the First, He determines the relation, and therefore in order to know what is the truth of the relation, man must know God
- HoP 2",143
7563,"Since therefore thought goes so far as to deny the natural, what we are now concerned with is not to seek truth in any existing mode, but from our inner Being to go forth again to a true objective, which derives its determination from the intrinsic nature of thought

- HoP 2",160
7566,"In him we for the first time see the application of the universal consciousness as philosophical consciousness
- HoP 2",118
7567,"In the reign of Caligula, before whom very heinous charges against the Jews had been brought by Apion, he was, when advanced in years, sent to Rome as ambassador from his people, in order to give to the Romans a more favourable account of the Jews
- HoP 2",255
7568,"Philo was famous for the great extent of his learning, and was well acquainted with Greek philosophy
- HoP 2",108
7569,"He is more especially distinguished for his Platonic philosophy, and also for the pains he took to demonstrate the presence of Philosophy in the sacred writings of the Jews
- HoP 2",180
7570,"In his explanation of the history of the Jewish nation, the narratives and statements therein contained have lost for him the immediate significance of reality
- HoP 2",167
7571,"He reads into them throughout a mystical and allegorical meaning, and finds Plato present in Moses; in short, the endeavour of Philo resembled that of the Alexandrians when they recognized philosophic dogmas in Greek mythology
- HoP 2",234
7572,"He treats of the nature of Mind, not, indeed, as comprehended in the element of thought, but as expressed therein, and this expression is still both far from pure and is associated with all sorts of imageries
- HoP 2",216
7573,"By the spirit of Philosophy the Jews were compelled to seek in their sacred books, as the heathen sought in Homer and in the popular religion, a deeper speculative meaning, and to represent their religious writings as a perfect system of divine wisdom
- HoP 2",259
7574,"That is the character of the time, in consequence of which all that appealed to the finite understanding in popular conceptions has not endured
- HoP 2",151
7575,"The important point, then, is that on the one hand the popular conception is here still allied with the forms of reality; but as, on the other hand, what these forms express only immediately is no longer sufficient, the desire arises to understand them in a deeper sense
- HoP 2",278
7576,"Although in the external histories of the Jewish and heathen religions men had the authority and starting-point of truth, they yet grasped the thought that truth cannot be given externally
- HoP 2",196
7577,"Therefore, men read deep thoughts into history, as the expression is, or they read them out of it, and this latter is the true conception
- HoP 2",145
7578,"For in the case of the Divine Book, whose author is the Spirit, it cannot be said that this spirituality is absent
- HoP 2",122
7579,"The point of importance comes to be, whether this spirituality lies deeper down or nearer to the surface; therefore, even if the man who wrote the book had not the thoughts, they are implicitly contained in the inward nature of the relation
- HoP 2",248
7580,"There is, generally speaking, a great difference between that which is present therein and that which is expressed
- HoP 2",122
7581,"In history, art, philosophy, and the like, the point of importance is that what is contained therein should also be expressed; the real work of the mind is wholly and solely that of bringing to consciousness what is contained therein
- HoP 2",241
7583,"On the one side, the bringing of thought into definite consciousness is a bringing in from without, but on the other side, as far as matter is concerned, there is nothing brought in from without
- HoP 2",202
7584,"Philo’s methods present this aspect in a pre-eminent sense
- HoP 2",66
7585,"All that is prosaic has disappeared, and, therefore, in writers of the period that follows, miracles are of common occurrence, inasmuch as external connection is no longer required as a matter of necessity
- HoP 2",213
7586,"The fundamental conceptions of Philo, and these alone need be taken into consideration, are then somewhat as follows:—  1
- HoP 2",129
7587,"With Philo the main point is the knowledge of God
- HoP 2",57
7588,"In regard to this, he says, in the first place: God can be known only by the eye of the soul, only by Beholding (ὅρασις)
- HoP 2",128
7589,"This he also calls rapture, ecstasy, God’s influence; we often find these terms
- HoP 2",87
7590,"For this it is requisite that the soul should break loose from the body, and should give up its sensuous existence, thus rising to the pure object of thought, where it finds itself nearer to God
- HoP 2",202
7591,"We may term this a beholding by the intelligence
- HoP 2",56
7592,"But the other side is that God cannot be discerned by the eye of the soul; the soul can only know that He is, and not what He is
- HoP 2",136
7593,"His essence is the primordial light208 Philo here speaks in quite Oriental fashion; for light is certainly simple, in contrast with which perception has the signification of knowing something as determined, as concrete in itself
- HoP 2",236
7594,"So long, therefore, as the determination of simplicity is adhered to, this First Light permits not itself to be known, and since Philo says, “This One is God as such,” we cannot know what God is
- HoP 2",202
7595,"In Christianity, on the contrary, simplicity is only a moment, and only in the Whole do we find God the Spirit
- HoP 2",118
7596,"Philo continues: “The First is the space of the universe, encompassing and filling it; this existence is itself place, and is filled by itself
- HoP 2",150
7597,"God is sufficient for Himself; all other things are paltry and meaningless; He fills all other things and gives them coherence, but He Himself is surrounded by nothing, because He Himself is One and All
- HoP 2",210
7598,"Similarly, God exists in the primordial form of time (αἰών),”209 that is, in the pure Notion of time
- HoP 2",108
7599,"Why is it necessary that God should fill Himself with Himself?
- HoP 2",70
7600,"Even the subjective and abstract has need also of an object
- HoP 2",67
7601,"But the all is likewise, as with Parmenides, the abstract, because it is only substance, which remains empty beside that which fills it
- HoP 2",143
7602,"Absolute fulness, on the other hand, is the concrete, and we reach this first in the λόγος, in which we have that which fills, that which is filled, and a third composed of both
- HoP 2",185
7603,"To this Philo now comes in the second place: “God’s image and reflection is thinking reason (λόγος), the Firstborn Son, who rules and regulates the world
- HoP 2",161
7604,"This λόγος is the innermost meaning of all Ideas; God Himself, in contrast to this, as the One, as such, is pure Being (τὸ ὄν) only210—an expression which Plato also used
- HoP 2",178
7605,"Here verily we come upon a contradiction; for the image can only represent what the thing is; if therefore the image is concrete, its original must also be understood to be concrete
- HoP 2",189
7606,"For the rest, it is therefore only logical, after Philo has once limited the name of God to the First Light or to pure Being, to assert that only the Son can be known
- HoP 2",174
7607,"For as this Being God is only abstract existence, or only His own Notion; and it is quite true that the soul cannot perceive what this Being is, since it is really only an empty abstraction
- HoP 2",197
7608,"What can be perceived is that pure existence is only an abstraction, and consequently a nothing, and not the true God
- HoP 2",125
7609,"Of God as the One it may therefore be said that the only thing perceived is that He does exist
- HoP 2",102
7610,"Perception is the knowledge of the concrete self-determination of the living God
- HoP 2",88
7612,"What is begotten is His other, which at the same time is in Him, and belongs to Him, and is thus a moment of Himself, if God is to be thought of as concrete and living it is this that is here by Philo called λόγος
- HoP 2",221
7613,"In Christianity the name of God is therefore not limited to Essence, but the Son is conceived of as a determination which itself belongs to the true Essence of God
- HoP 2",171
7614,"That which God is, He is therefore as Spirit only, and that is the unity of these moments
- HoP 2",97
7615,"God’s differences therefore, according to Philo, constitute the finite understanding (λόγος) itself, which is then the archangel (ἀρχάγγελος), a realm of thought which contains determinateness
- HoP 2",200
7616,"That is man as heavenly man, primeval man, who is also represented under the name of Wisdom (σοφία, תגמה), as Adam Kadmon, as the rising of the sun—man in God
- HoP 2",166
7617,"This finite understanding now separates itself into Ideas, which by Philo are also named angels or messengers (ἄγγελοι)
- HoP 2",127
7618,"This mode of conception is not yet conception in pure thought, for forms of the imagination are still interwoven with it
- HoP 2",128
7619,"Moreover there comes in here for the first time that which determines, where God is looked on as activity, which so far Being was not
- HoP 2",141
7620,"This λόγος is therefore itself, we might say, the first restful world of thought, although it is already differentiated; but another λόγος is that which gives utterance (λόγος προφορικός) as speech
- HoP 2",205
7621,"That is the activity, the creation of the world, as the former is its preservation, its permanent understanding
- HoP 2",119
7622,"Speech has always been regarded as a manifestation of God, because it is not corporeal; as sound it is momentary and immediately disappears; its existence is therefore immaterial
- HoP 2",186
7623,"For natural things are upheld only in their laws; but self-conscious beings know also of these laws, and this is wisdom
- HoP 2",127
7624,"Thus the λόγος is the high priest, who is the mediator between God and man, the Spirit of the Godhead, who teaches man—even the self-conscious return of God into Himself, into that first unity of the primordial light
- HoP 2",224
7625,"That is the pure intelligible world of truth itself, which is nothing other than the Word of God212  3
- HoP 2",110
7626,"In the third place, since thought has come to negativity, the sensuous existent world stands in opposition to this ideal world
- HoP 2",134
7628,"It exists, in so far as there is placed within it a resemblance to implicit truth
- HoP 2",89
7629,"Philo had the true perception that the opposite of Being is just as positive as Being
- HoP 2",93
7630,"If this seems absurd to anyone, he need only be reminded that really when we posit Being, the negative of Being is thinking—which is something very positive
- HoP 2",164
7631,"But the next step, the Notion of this opposition, and the passing of Being into non-being, is not to be found in Philo
- HoP 2",126
7632,"In general this philosophy is less a metaphysic of the Notion or of Thought itself, than a philosophy in which Mind appears only in pure Thought, and not here in the mode of ordinary conception—Notions and Ideas are still represented as independent forms
- HoP 2",262
7633,"Thus, for instance, it is said: “In the beginning the Word of God created the heavens, which consist of the purest Being and are the dwelling-place of the purest angels, which do not appear, and are not perceptible by the senses,” but by thought alone; these are the Ideas
- HoP 2",280
7634,"Philo now proceeds according to the Mosaic record
- HoP 2",57
7635,"In the Old Testament history of creation, grass, plants, and trees are created on the third day, and on the fourth day lights in the firmament of heaven, the sun and moon
- HoP 2",178
7636,"Philo therefore says (De mundi opificio, pp
- HoP 2",51
7637,"The Cabalistic philosophy and the Gnostic theology both occupied themselves with these same conceptions which Philo also had
- HoP 2",132
7638,"To them also the First is the abstract, the unknown, the nameless; the Second is the unveiling, the concrete, which goes forth into emanation
- HoP 2",149
7639,"Cabala is the name given to the secret wisdom of the Jews, with which, however, much that is dark and mysterious is mingled; regarding its origin also many fables are related
- HoP 2",182
7640,"Jezirah, the more important of these two books, is ascribed to a certain Rabbi Akibha; it is about to be published in a more complete form by Herr von Mayer, in Frankfort
- HoP 2",178
7641,"The book has certain very interesting general principles, and this better portion of it consists of ideas, which in some respects resemble those of Philo, though they are more fancifully presented, and often sink into the fantastic
- HoP 2",239
7642,"It is not of the antiquity which those who reverence the Cabala would assign to it; for they relate that this heavenly book was given to Adam to console him after his fall
- HoP 2",179
7643,"It is a medley of astronomy, magic, medicine, and prophecy; sundry traces followed up historically indicate that such were cultivated in Egypt
- HoP 2",150
7645,"The second book is said to have been the work of his disciple, Rabbi Simeon Ben Jochai, who was called the Great Light, the Spark of Moses215 Both books were translated into Latin in the seventeenth century
- HoP 2",214
7646,"A speculative Israelite, Rabbi Abraham Cohen Irira, also wrote a book, the Door of Heaven (Porta c\nlorum); it is later, dating from the fifteenth century, and sundry references to the Arabians and Scholastics are contained in it
- HoP 2",237
7647,"These are the sources of the high cabalistic wisdom
- HoP 2",59
7650,"Further particulars of the Cabala are these
- HoP 2",51
7651,"One is expressed as the principle of all things, as it is likewise the first source of all numbers
- HoP 2",106
7652,"As unity itself is not one number among the rest, so is it with God, the basis of all things, the En-Soph
- HoP 2",113
7653,"The emanation therewith connected is the effect of the first cause by the limitation of that first infinite whose boundary (ὅρος) it is
- HoP 2",143
7654,"In this one cause all is contained eminenter, not formaliter but causaliter
- HoP 2",83
7655,"The second element of importance is the Adam Kadmon, the first man, Kether, the first that arose, the highest crown, the microcosm, the macrocosm, with which the world that emanated stands in connection as the efflux of light
- HoP 2",233
7656,"By further expansion the other spheres or circles of the world came into being; and this emanation is represented as streams of light
- HoP 2",141
7657,"In the first place there come forth ten of such emanations, Sephiroth, forming the pure world Azilah, which exists in itself and changes not
- HoP 2",148
7658,"The second is the world Beriah, which does change
- HoP 2",57
7659,"The third is the created world, Jezirah, the world of pure spirits set in matter, the souls of the stars—that is, further distinctions into which this dark and mysterious philosophy proceeds
- HoP 2",198
7660,"In the fourth place comes the created world, the Asijja: it is the lowest, the vegetative and sensible world216   2
- HoP 2",123
7661,"Though there are various sects of the Gnostics, we find certain common determinations constituting their basis
- HoP 2",118
7662,"Their general aim was that of knowledge (γνῶσις); whence they also derived their name
- HoP 2",93
7663,"One of the most distinguished Gnostics is Basilides
- HoP 2",59
7664,"For him, too, the First is the unspeakable God (θεὸς ἄῤῥητος)—the En-Soph of the Cabala; He is, as with Philo also, that which is (τὸ ὄν), He who is (ὁ ὤν), the nameless one (ἀνωνόμαστος)—that is, the immediate
- HoP 2",218
7665,"The second is then the Spirit (νοῦς), the first-born, also λόγος, the Wisdom (σοφία), Power (δύναμις): more closely defined, it is Righteousness (δικαιοσύνη), and Peace (εἰρήνη)
- HoP 2",185
7666,"These are followed by principles still further determined, which Basilides names archons, heads of spiritual kingdoms
- HoP 2",125
7667,"One main point in this is likewise the return, the refining process of the soul, the economy of purification (οἰκονονία καθάρσεων): the soul from matter must come back to wisdom, to peace
- HoP 2",195
7668,"The First Essence bears all perfection sealed up in Himself, but only in potentiality; Spirit, the first-born, is the first revelation of the latent
- HoP 2",156
7672,"Æons, particular expositions, are Notions
- HoP 2",49
7673,"The second step is likewise termed limitation (ὅρος); and inasmuch as the development of life is conceived more clearly by contrast, the key to this is stated to be contained in two principles, which appear in the form of male and female
- HoP 2",245
7674,"The one is required to perfect the other, each has its complement (σύζυγος) in the other; from their conjunction (σύνθεσις, συξυγία), which first constitutes the real, a perfect whole proceeds
- HoP 2",200
7676,"Ptolemæus assigns two conjunctions (σύζυγους) to the abyss, and two separations, which are pre-supposed throughout all temporal existence, Will and Perception (θέλημα καὶ ἔννοια)
- HoP 2",186
7677,"Complicated and motley forms here appear, but the fundamental determination is the same throughout, and abyss and revelation are the most important matters
- HoP 2",163
7678,"The revelation which has come down is also conceived as the glory (δόξα, Shekinah) of God; as heavenly wisdom, which is itself a beholding of God; as unbegotten powers which encircle Him and are radiant with the most brilliant light
- HoP 2",240
7680,"I have, however, merely been desirous of calling these forms to remembrance, in order to indicate their connection with the universal
- HoP 2",141
7681,"The unity of self-consciousness and Being appears in more philosophical and intelligent form in the Alexandrian School, which constitutes the most important, and at the same time the most characteristic form of philosophy pertaining to this sphere
- HoP 2",255
7682,"For Alexandria had for some time past, mainly through the Ptolemies, become the principal seat of the sciences
- HoP 2",118
7684,"This endeavour has doubtless given birth to much that is dim and mystical; its purer product is the Alexandrian Philosophy
- HoP 2",130
7685,"The bringing together of the philosophies naturally succeeded better than those connections which, on the side of religion, are only the mystic products of a Reason that as yet is unintelligible to itself
- HoP 2",212
7686,"For while in fact there is but one Idea in Philosophy, it annuls by its own means the special form which it has adopted, the one-sidedness in which it expresses itself
- HoP 2",175
7687,"In Scepticism had been reached this negative stage of seeing annulled the definite modes of Being in which the Absolute was posited
- HoP 2",139
7691,"Diogenes is also earlier than the Alexandrian School; but Potamo, according to Suidas (sv
- HoP 2",97
7692,"III, p 161), was tutor of the stepsons of Augustus, and for the instructor of princes eclecticism is a very suitable creed
- HoP 2",130
7693,"Therefore, because this Potamo is an Alexandrian, Brucker has bestowed on the Alexandrian philosophy the name of Eclectic; but that is neither consistent with fact, nor is it true to history
- HoP 2",198
7695,"Such an eclecticism gives nothing but an aggregate which lacks all inward consistency
- HoP 2",93
7697,"An eclectic philosophy is something that is altogether meaningless and inconsequent: and such a philosophy the Alexandrian philosophy is not
- HoP 2",148
7698,"In France the Alexandrians are still called Eclectics; and there, where système is synonymous with narrowness of views, and where indeed one must have the name which sounds least systematic and suspicious, that may be borne with
- HoP 2",236
7699,"In the better sense of the word the Alexandrians may, however, very well be called eclectic philosophers, though it is quite superfluous to give them this designation at all
- HoP 2",181
7701,"Therefore we find in them no refutation of the views of the philosophers whom they quote
- HoP 2",96
7702,"To this higher culture there more especially belongs the deeper principle that absolute essence must be apprehended as self-consciousness, that its very essence is to be self-consciousness, and that it is therefore in the individual consciousness
- HoP 2",254
7703,"This is not to be understood as signifying that God is a Spirit who is outside of the world and outside self-consciousness, as is often said, but as indicating that His existence as self-conscious spirit is really self-consciousness itself
- HoP 2",247
7704,"The Platonic universal, which is in thought, accordingly receives the signification of being as such absolute essence
- HoP 2",125
7705,"In the higher sense a wider point of view as regards the Idea thus signifies its concretely blending into one the preceding principles, which contain only single one-sided moments of the Idea
- HoP 2",199
7706,"This really indicates a deeper knowledge of the philosophical Idea which is known concretely in itself, so that the more abstract principles are contained in the deeper form of the Idea
- HoP 2",193
7707,"For after some divergence has taken place in the past it must from time to time come about that the implicit identity of the divergent views is recognized, so that difference has force only as form
- HoP 2",205
7709,"All earlier philosophies could therefore find a place in that of the Alexandrians
- HoP 2",89
7710,"For in Alexandria the Ptolemies had attracted to themselves science and the learned, partly by reason of their own interest in science, and partly on account of the excellence of their institutions
- HoP 2",205
7711,"They founded the great and celebrated library for which the Greek translation of the Old Testament was made; after Cæsar had destroyed it, it was again restored
- HoP 2",168
7712,"There was also there a museum, or what would nowadays be called an Academy of Science, where philosophers and men of special learning received payments of money, and had no other duties than that of prosecuting scientific study
- HoP 2",235
7713,"In later times such foundations were instituted in Athens also, and each philosophic school had its own public establishment,221 without favour being shown to one philosophy or to the other
- HoP 2",197
7714,"Thus the Neo-Platonic philosophy arose beside the others, and partly upon their ruins, and overshadowed the rest, until finally all earlier systems were merged therein
- HoP 2",175
7715,"It, therefore, did not constitute an individual philosophical school similar to those which went before; but, while it united them all in itself, it had as its leading characteristic the study of Plato, of Aristotle, and of the Pythagoreans
- HoP 2",248
7716,"These commentaries on the early philosophers were either given in lectures or written; and many of them have come down to us, some in the number being excellent
- HoP 2",168
7717,"Aristotle’s works were commented on by Alexander Aphrodisiensis, Andronicus Rhodius, Nicolaus Damascenus, and also Porphyrius
- HoP 2",133
7718,"Plato had as commentators Numenius and Maximus Tyrius
- HoP 2",61
7719,"Other Alexandrians combined a commentary on Plato with study of the other philosophic maxims or philosophies, and managed to grasp the point of unity of the various modes of the Idea very successfully
- HoP 2",208
7720,"The best commentaries date from this period; most of the works of Proclus are commentaries on single dialogues of Plato and similar subjects
- HoP 2",148
7721,"This school has the further peculiarity of expressing speculation as actual divine Being and life, and, therefore, it makes this appear to be mystical and magical
- HoP 2",170
7722,"Ammonius Saccas, that is, the sack-bearer, is named as one of the first or most celebrated teachers of this school; he died AD 243222 But we have none of his writings, nor have any traditions regarding his philosophy come down to us
- HoP 2",240
7723,"Among his very numerous disciples Ammonius had many men celebrated in other branches of science, for example, Longinus and Origen; it is, however, uncertain if this were the Christian Father of that name
- HoP 2",211
7724,"But his most renowned disciple in philosophy is Plotinus, through whose writings as they are preserved to us we derive our chief knowledge of the Neo-Platonic philosophy
- HoP 2",177
7725,"The systematized fabric of this philosophy is, indeed, ascribed to him by those who came after, and this philosophy is known specially as his philosophy
- HoP 2",160
7727,"From the same disciple we have an account of the life of Plotinus; what is remarkable in it is that the strictly historical facts recounted are mixed up with a great variety of marvellous episodes
- HoP 2",204
7728,"This is certainly the period when the marvellous plays a prominent part; but when the pure system of Philosophy, the pure meaning of such a man, is known, it is impossible to express all one’s astonishment at anecdotes of this kind
- HoP 2",239
7729,"Plotinus was an Egyptian; he was born at Lycopolis about AD 205, in the reign of Septimius Severus
- HoP 2",106
7730,"After he had attended the lectures of many teachers of Philosophy, he became melancholy and absorbed in thought; at the age of eight and twenty he came to Ammonius, and, finding here at last what satisfied him, he remained for eleven years under his instruction
- HoP 2",269
7732,"At the age of forty he proceeded to Rome, and remained there until his death, twenty-six years later
- HoP 2",108
7733,"In Rome his outward demeanour was most remarkable; in accordance with the ancient Pythagorean practice, he refrained from partaking of flesh, and often imposed fasts on himself; he wore, also, the ancient Pythagorean dress
- HoP 2",230
7734,"As a public lecturer, however, he gained a high reputation among all classes
- HoP 2",84
7735,"The Emperor of those days, Gallienus, whose favour Plotinus enjoyed, as well as that of the Empress, is said to have been inclined to hand over to him a town in Campania, where he thought to realize the Platonic Republic
- HoP 2",228
7737,"It does little credit to the sagacity of Plotinus that this idea ever entered into his head; but we do not exactly know if his plan were limited to the Platonic Republic, or if it did not admit of some extension or modification thereof
- HoP 2",243
7738,"Of course an actual Platonic state was contrary to the nature of things; for the Platonic state is free and independent, which such an one as this, within the Roman Empire, could of course not be
- HoP 2",203
7740,"In his teaching Plotinus adopted, as has been already mentioned, the method of commenting in his lectures on the writings of various earlier philosophers
- HoP 2",161
7741,"The writings of Plotinus are known as Enneads, and are six in number, each of them containing nine separate treatises
- HoP 2",125
7742,"The books do not, however, form a connected whole; but in each book, in fact, there are special matters brought forward and philosophically handled; and it is thus laborious to go through them
- HoP 2",200
7744,"Other Enneads are of a metaphysical nature
- HoP 2",50
7745,"Porphyrius says in his Life of Plotinus (pp

- HoP 2",148
7748,"Creuzer is preparing to bring out an edition of Plotinus
- HoP 2",64
7749,"To give an account of him would be a difficult task, and would amount to a systematic explanation
- HoP 2",105
7750,"The mind of Plotinus hovers over each of the particular matters that he deals with; he treats them rationally and dialectically, but traces them all back to one Idea
- HoP 2",173
7751,"Many beautiful detached quotations could be made from Plotinus, but as there is in his works a continual repetition of certain leading thoughts, the reading of them is apt to prove wearisome
- HoP 2",198
7754,"The main point is that he is not to be taken as placing Plato and Aristotle in opposition; on the contrary, he went so far as to adopt even the Logos of the Stoics
- HoP 2",171
7755,"It is very difficult to give a systematic account of his philosophy
- HoP 2",75
7756,"For it is not the aim of Plotinus, as it was of Aristotle, to comprehend objects in their special determinations, but rather to emphasize the truth of the substantial in them as against the phenomenal
- HoP 2",208
7757,"The point of greatest importance and the leading characteristic in Plotinus is his high, pure enthusiasm for the elevation of mind to what is good and true, to the absolute
- HoP 2",180
7758,"He lays hold of knowledge, the simply ideal, and of intellectual thought, which is implicitly life, but not silent nor sealed
- HoP 2",133
7760,"The whole tenor of his philosophy thus leads up to virtue and to the intellectual contemplation of the eternal, as source of the same; so that the soul is brought to happiness of life therein
- HoP 2",199
7761,"Plotinus then enters to some extent on special considerations of virtue, with the view of cleansing the soul from passions, from false and impure conceptions of evil and destiny, and also from incredulity and superstition, from astrology and magic and all their train
- HoP 2",275
7762,"This gives some idea of the general drift of his teaching
- HoP 2",65
7767,"Fanaticism like this places truth in an existence which stands midway between reality and the Notion, but is neither the one nor the other,—and therefore only a creature of the imagination
- HoP 2",196
7768,"From this view of ecstasy, however, Plotinus is far removed
- HoP 2",67
7770,"Partly, however, the imputation is due to the manner in which Plotinus speaks in general of Notions, spiritual moments as such, as if they had a substantial existence of their own
- HoP 2",187
7772,"For the magician is just he who attributes to certain words and particular sensuous signs a universal efficacy, and who attempts by prayers, &c, to lift them up to the universal
- HoP 2",185
7775,"Upholding as they did the belief in the gods of heathendom, they asserted in reference to the worship of images that these really were filled with the divine power and presence
- HoP 2",184
7777,"But what the philosophers taught is utterly remote therefrom; except the quite theoretical observation regarding the images of the gods which we mentioned above, the writings of Plotinus contain nothing in any way related thereto
- HoP 2",237
7780,"For Plato most certainly speaks with enthusiasm of the elevation of the spirit into thought, or rather the Platonic enthusiasm proper consists in rising into the sphere of the movement of thought
- HoP 2",203
7782,"But we are not speaking of this or that animal perceived by our senses, but of its essential reality, and this is the Notion of it
- HoP 2",138
7783,"The essential reality of the animal is not present as such in the animal of our senses, but as being one with the objective individuality, as a mode of that universal; as essence it is our Notion, which indeed alone is true, whereas what the senses perceive is negative
- HoP 2",277
7784,"Thus our Notion of absolute essence is the essence itself, when it is the Notion of absolute essence, not of something else
- HoP 2",131
7785,"But this essence does not seem to be co-extensive with the idea of God; for He is not only Essence or His Notion, but His existence
- HoP 2",139
7786,"His existence, as pure essence, is our thought of Him; but His real existence is Nature
- HoP 2",95
7787,"In this real existence the ‘I’ is that which has the faculty of individual thought; it belongs to this existence as a moment present in it, but does not constitute it
- HoP 2",174
7788,"From the existence of essence as essence we must pass over to existence, to real existence as such
- HoP 2",106
7789,"As such, God is doubtless a Beyond to individual self-consciousness, that is to say, of course, in the capacity of essence or pure thought; thus to a certain extent He, as individual reality, is Nature which is beyond thought
- HoP 2",233
7790,"But even this objective mode comes back into essence, or the individuality of consciousness is overcome
- HoP 2",111
7791,"Therefore what has brought upon Plotinus the reproach of fanaticism is this, that he had the thought of the essence of God being Thought itself and present in Thought
- HoP 2",174
7793,"In further defining the relation of individual self-consciousness to the knowledge of absolute essence, Plotinus asserts (Ennead
- HoP 2",136
7794,"The principle of the philosophy of Plotinus is therefore the Reason which is in and for itself
- HoP 2",102
7795,"The condition of ecstasy through which alone that which has true Being comes to be known, is named by Plotinus (Ennead
- HoP 2",126
7797,"This withdrawal of the soul from the body takes place through pure thought; thought is the activity and at the same time the object
- HoP 2",139
7798,"It is thus a tranquil state, without any wild turmoil of the blood or of the imagination
- HoP 2",96
7799,"Ecstasy is not a mere rapturous condition of the senses and fancy, but rather a passing beyond the content of sensuous consciousness; it is pure thought that is at home with itself, and is its own object
- HoP 2",211
7801,"Yet his figurative mode of expression separates itself still more from the, in great measure, confused mythical ideas
- HoP 2",125
7803,"As for the determinate principle of Plotinus, the objective, the content, which is at home with itself in this ecstasy, in this Being of Thought—this content, as regards its chief moments in the universal, is that already dealt with
- HoP 2",240
7804,"The three principles are for him the One, the νοῦς and the soul
- HoP 2",71
7805,"The first, the absolute, the basis, is here, as with Philo, pure Being, the unchangeable, which is the basis and the cause of all Being that appears, whose potentiality is not apart from its actuality, but is absolute actuality in itself
- HoP 2",245
7806,"It is the unity which is likewise essence, or unity as the essence of all essence
- HoP 2",89
7807,"The true principle is not the multiplicity of present Being, the ordinary substantiality of things, according to which each appears as one separated from the others, for really and truly their unity is their essence
- HoP 2",223
7808,"This unity is, properly speaking, not All; for All is nothing but the result of the units, the comprehension of them—forming the basis, as they do, as essence—in a unity which is strange to them
- HoP 2",202
7812,"And up to this point all is beautiful, but it is more than beautiful (ὑπέρκαλος) and better than the best (ἐπέκεινα τῶν ἀρίστων), the superlatively good, bearing free rule, exercising royal rights in Thought (βασιλεύων ἐν τῷ νοητῷ)
- HoP 2",239
7813,"But it is itself by no means that whose principle it is
- HoP 2",63
7814,"For when thou hast said “the Good,” add nothing thereto, and think of nothing beyond
- HoP 2",92
7815,"And when thou hast Being thus before thee, and regardest it in this purity, wonder will lay hold of thee”228  Of absolute Being Plotinus then asserted that it is unknowable—which Philo also said—and that it remains in itself
- HoP 2",232
7817,"All such predicates as Being and substance do not conform to it in the opinion of Plotinus; for they express some determination or other
- HoP 2",144
7818,"There is no sensation, no thought, no consciousness; for in all these there lies a distinction
- HoP 2",102
7820,"We term it the One and the Good
- HoP 2",39
7821,"It neither is, nor is it something, nor is it anything, but it is over all
- HoP 2",82
7822,"All these categories are negatived; it has no magnitude, is not infinite
- HoP 2",80
7824,"But out of this First all proceeds, owing to its revealing itself; that is the connection with creation and all production
- HoP 2",130
7825,"But the Absolute cannot be conceived as creative, if it is determinate as an abstract, and is not rather comprehended as the One which has energy in itself
- HoP 2",163
7826,"This transition to the determinate is thus not made by Plotinus philosophically or dialectically, but the necessity of it is expressed in representations and images
- HoP 2",172
7827,"Thus he says (Ennead
- HoP 2",28
7828,"Now what is first begotten by this Unity, the Son, is finite understanding (νοῦς), the second Divine Being, the other principle
- HoP 2",135
7829,"Here the main difficulty confronts us—the task known and recognized long years ago—the comprehension of how the One came to the decision to determine itself; and the endeavour to elucidate this fact still constitutes the essential point of interest
- HoP 2",256
7830,"The ancients did not frame this question in the definite form in which we have it; but they nevertheless occupied themselves with it
- HoP 2",140
7831,"For the νοῦς is nothing more or less than the self-finding of self; it is the pure duality (δυάς), itself and its object; it contains all that is thought, it is this distinction, but pure distinction that remains at the same time identical with itself
- HoP 2",259
7832,"Simple unity is, however, the First
- HoP 2",43
7833,"Plotinus thus also says in a somewhat Pythagorean fashion that things are as numbers in this λόγος
- HoP 2",106
7834,"The first number is the two, but as indeterminate duality; and the one is what determines it; the two is also the soul
- HoP 2",126
7835,"Number is the solid; what sensuous perception takes to be existent, is a later development”231  Plotinus has here (Ennead
- HoP 2",129
7838,"In this pure thought or contemplation the νοῦς is actual; and this is divine activity itself
- HoP 2",100
7840,"But God,” as One, the Good, “is the immovable; and production is a light proceeding from Him who endures
- HoP 2",112
7841,"The One sheds light round about Himself; the finite understanding flows from Him, the enduring one, just as the light from the sun encircles it
- HoP 2",151
7842,"All things which are permanent give forth and diffuse from their substance an essence which is dependent upon them;” or, as Plotinus really says, it is identical with them
- HoP 2",179
7843,"This that is produced merely, however, returns to the One,” the Good, “which is its object, content and fulfilling; and this is finite understanding,”—this the reversion of what is produced to the original unity
- HoP 2",219
7845,"Only there is a difficulty here which makes us pause; and it is found in this development
- HoP 2",97
7846,"The necessity of self-disclosure is not expressed thereby, for it is stated only as something having come to pass
- HoP 2",121
7847,"That the Father begets the eternal Son satisfies the imagination; the Idea is according to its content quite correctly conceived as the Trinity, and this is an important matter
- HoP 2",184
7848,"But although these determinations are true, the form of the immediacy of movement is at the same time neither sufficient nor satisfying for the Notion
- HoP 2",158
7849,"For because the Becoming of the simple unity, as the abrogation of all predicates, is that same absolute negativity which is implicitly the production of itself, we must not begin with unity and only then pass over into duality, but we must grasp them both as one
- HoP 2",271
7850,"For, according to Plotinus, the object of the finite understanding is clearly nothing which is alien or opposite to this or to itself; the manifold Ideas are alone the content of the same
- HoP 2",195
7851,"God therefore through distinction and extension is likewise a return to Himself, that is, this very duality is simply in the unity, and is its object
- HoP 2",157
7852,"The object of thought, that to which thought turns back, is absolute unity; into this, however, as such, there is no forcing a way, and it is not determined, but remains the unknown
- HoP 2",189
7853,"Since thinking is, however, only the fact of having itself as object, it has thus already an object which contains mediation and activity, or, to speak generally, duality in itself
- HoP 2",188
7854,"This is Thought as the thought of Thought
- HoP 2",49
7855,"Or in the perfecting of this thought in itself, inasmuch as it is its own object, there lies for Plotinus the first and truly intellectual world, which thus stands to the world of sense in such a relation that the latter is only a distant imitation of the former
- HoP 2",270
7856,"Things, looked at as they exist in this absolute Thought, are their own Notions and essence (λόγοι); and these are the patterns of sensuous existences, as Plato also expressed it234  That the nature of thought is to think itself, is a quite Aristotelian definition
- HoP 2",272
7858,"Of the relation of these many Notions in the understanding, Plotinus states that they are present there, just as the elements are present in a thing, and therefore not as mutually indifferent species, but as being diverse and yet entirely one
- HoP 2",250
7859,"They are not indifferent through space, but only differ through an inner difference, that is, not in the manner of existent parts235 The finite understanding is thereby expressed as negative unity
- HoP 2",204
7861,"Their Being is really neutrality, in which each of them is abrogated as indifferent and existent: therefore their unity is negative unity, the inner essence, the principle of individuality as containing in itself elements that differ
- HoP 2",241
7862,"Further, there is for it a three-fold mode of thinking: in the first place it thinks the unchangeable, its unity, as object
- HoP 2",131
7863,"This first mode is the simple undifferentiated contemplation of its object, or it is light; not matter, but pure form, activity
- HoP 2",135
7864,"Space is the abstract pure continuity of this activity of light, not the activity itself, but the form of its uninterruptedness
- HoP 2",135
7865,"The understanding, as the thought of this light, is itself light, but light real in itself, or the light of light236 In the second place the understanding thinks the difference between itself and essence; the differentiated multiplicity of the existent is object for it
- HoP 2",277
7866,"It is the creation of the world; in it everything has its determinate form in regard to everything else, and this constitutes the substance of things
- HoP 2",157
7867,"Since, in the third place, substantiality or permanency in the faculty of thought is determination, its production, or the flowing out of all things from it, is of such a nature that it remains filled with all things, or likewise absorbs all immediately
- HoP 2",261
7868,"It is the abrogation of these differences, or the passing over from one to another; this is its manner of thinking itself, or it is object to itself in this fashion
- HoP 2",172
7869,"This is change; thinking has thus the three principles in it
- HoP 2",68
7870,"Inasmuch as νοῦς thinks of itself as changing, but yet in change remaining simple and at home with itself, the subject of its thought is life as a whole; and the fact of its establishing its moments as existing in opposition to each other is the true, living universe
- HoP 2",275
7871,"This turning round on itself of the outflow from itself, this thinking of itself, is the eternal creation of the world237 It is plain that in these thoughts of Plotinus the Being-another, the foreign element, is abrogated, existent things are implicitly Notions
- HoP 2",269
7872,"The Divine understanding is the thinking of them, and their existence is nothing else than this very fact of their being the object of thought of the Divine understanding; they are moments of thought and, for this very reason, of Being
- HoP 2",243
7873,"The distinction between thought and an external God is thus doubtless at an end; for this reason the Neo-Platonists are accused of being visionaries, and in truth they do themselves propound wondrous things
- HoP 2",214
7874,"The movement to it and around it is the activity of the soul
- HoP 2",68
7875,"Reason (λόγος), which passes from it to the soul, confers on the soul a power of thought, placing nothing between them
- HoP 2",126
7876,"Thinking (νοῦς) is not a manifold; thinking is simple, and consists in the very fact of thinking
- HoP 2",104
7878,"Our soul is partly in the eternal” (light), “a part of the universal soul; this itself is in part in the eternal, and flows out thence, remaining in contemplation of itself, without any designed regulation
- HoP 2",213
7879,"The embellishment of the whole gives to every corporeal object what in view of its determination and nature it is capable of carrying out, just as a central fire diffuses warmth all around it
- HoP 2",199
7881,"Similarly souls must not exist alone, as if what is produced through them should not appear, for in every nature it is immanent to make and bring to light something in conformity with itself, as the seed does from an undivided beginning
- HoP 2",244
7883,"He dwells much on this subject of matter in his philosophy
- HoP 2",66
7884,"Matter is the non-existent (οῦκ ὄν), which presents an image of the existent
- HoP 2",84
7885,"Things differ in their pure form, the difference that distinguishes them; the universal of difference is the negative, and this is matter
- HoP 2",145
7887,"Plotinus describes this pure potentiality very well, and defines it as the negative principle
- HoP 2",101
7888,"He says, “Brass is a statue only in potentiality; for in what is not permanent, the possible, as we have seen, was something utterly different
- HoP 2",150
7889,"But when the grammarian in potentiality becomes the grammarian in actuality, the potential is the same as the actual
- HoP 2",124
7890,"The ignorant man may be a grammarian, as it were by accident (κατὰ συμβεβηκός), and it is not in virtue of his present ignorance that he has the possibility of knowledge
- HoP 2",177
7891,"It is for the very reason of its possessing a certain measure of knowledge that the soul which is actual attains to what it was potentially
- HoP 2",147
7892,"It would not be inappropriate to give the name of form and idea to energy, in so far as it exists as energy and not as mere potentiality—not simply as energy, but as the energy of something determinate
- HoP 2",209
7893,"For we might give the name more properly, perhaps, to another energy, namely that which is opposed to the potentiality which leads to actuality, for the possible has the possibility of being something else in actuality
- HoP 2",226
7894,"But through possibility the possible has also in itself actuality, just as skill has the activity related thereto, and as bravery has brave action
- HoP 2",154
7896,"Should we consider matter to be there as form, as even the soul, although a form, is matter in respect to what is different?
- HoP 2",132
7897,"But, speaking generally, matter is not in actuality, it is what exists in potentiality
- HoP 2",94
7898,"Its Being only announces a Becoming, so that its Being has always to do with future Being
- HoP 2",97
7899,"That which is in potentiality is thus not something, but everything;” energy alone is determinate
- HoP 2",105
7900,"Is it then an image in respect to reality, and therefore a deception?
- HoP 2",77
7901,"This is the same as a true deception, this is the true non-existent;” it is untrue by reason of energy
- HoP 2",110
7902,"If you take away from the false its falseness, you take away all the existence that it has
- HoP 2",98
7903,"Similarly, if you introduce actuality into that which has its Being and its essence in potentiality, you destroy the cause of its substance (ὑποστάσεως), because Being consisted for it in potentiality
- HoP 2",208
7904,"If we would therefore retain matter uninjured, we must keep it as matter; apparently we must therefore say that it is only in potentiality, in order that it may remain what it is”241  In accordance with this, therefore, Plotinus (Ennead
- HoP 2",244
7905,"The Idea of change is itself imperishable, but what is implied in this Idea is changeable
- HoP 2",97
7906,"This matter is nevertheless not without form; and we have seen that the finite understanding has a third relationship to its object, namely in reference to differences
- HoP 2",175
7908,"The Evil likewise, as contrasted with the Good, now begins to be the object of consideration, for the question of the origin of evil must always be a matter of interest to the human consciousness
- HoP 2",203
7909,"These Alexandrians set up as matter the negative of thought, but since the consciousness of the concrete mind entered in, the abstract negative is apprehended in this concrete fashion as within the mind itself, therefore as the mentally negative
- HoP 2",253
7910,"Plotinus regards this question of evil from many sides; but thoughtful consideration of this subject does not yet go very far
- HoP 2",133
7912,"But νοῦς, as we now understand it, contains all things in itself, is all things, and is at home with itself; it has all things while not having them,” because it is in itself ideal
- HoP 2",188
7913,"For it is each thing and everything and not confounded, but absolute
- HoP 2",76
7914,"Νοῦς is the first energy and the first substance of the soul, which has activity in regard thereto
- HoP 2",106
7916,"But there are goods of the first and second and third rank, all surrounding the King over all; and He is the originator of all good, and all is His, and those of the second rank revolve round the second, and those of the third round the third
- HoP 2",250
7917,"If this is the existent and something even higher than the existent, evil is not included in what is existent or higher than the existent; for this is the good
- HoP 2",167
7919,"Thus evil has its root in the non-existent
- HoP 2",50
7920,"In the eighth book of the first Ennead Plotinus says (c 9, 3, 4, 7): “But how is evil recognized?
- HoP 2",105
7921,"It is owing to thought turning away from itself that matter arises; it exists only through the abstraction of what is other than itself
- HoP 2",143
7923,"But why then, when there is the Good, is there also necessarily Evil?
- HoP 2",77
7924,"Because there must be matter in the whole, because the whole necessarily consists of opposites
- HoP 2",102
7925,"It would not be there, if matter were not present; the nature of the world is compounded of νοῦς and necessity
- HoP 2",118
7926,"To be with the gods means to be in thought; for they are immortal
- HoP 2",73
7927,"We may also apprehend the necessity of evil in this wise: As the Good cannot exist alone, matter is a counterpart to the Good, necessary to its production
- HoP 2",162
7928,"Or we might also say that Evil is that which by reason of constant deterioration and decay has sunk until it can sink no lower; but something is necessary after the first, so that the extreme is also necessary
- HoP 2",217
7929,"But that is matter, which has no longer any element of good in it; and this is the necessity of evil”  With Plotinus, as with Pythagoras, the leading of the soul to virtue is also an important subject
- HoP 2",208
7930,"Plotinus has for this reason blamed the Gnostics frequently, especially in the ninth book of the second Ennead (c 15), because “they make no mention at all of virtue and the Good, nor of how they may be reached, and the soul rendered better and purer
- HoP 2",258
7931,"For no purpose is served by saying,243 ‘Look unto God;’ it must also be shown how we can succeed in causing man thus to behold God
- HoP 2",138
7933,"Plotinus honoured the heathen gods, attributing to them a deep meaning and a profound efficacy
- HoP 2",102
7934,"He says in the same treatise (c 16), “It is not by despising the world and the gods in it, and all else that is beautiful, that man attains to goodness
- HoP 2",159
7935,"The wicked man holds the gods in contempt, and it is only when he has completely reached this stage that he becomes utterly depraved
- HoP 2",140
7936,"The above-mentioned reverence of the Gnostics for the intelligible gods (νοητοὺς θεούς) is nothing corresponding with this (ἀσυμπαθὴς ἂν γένοιτο):” that is to say, there is no harmony between thoughts and the real world, when one does not go beyond the object of thought
- HoP 2",278
7937,"Every soul is the daughter of this father
- HoP 2",49
7938,"But souls in the heavenly spheres are more intelligible, and better, and far more nearly related to the higher Power than our souls are
- HoP 2",143
7939,"For how could this world of reality be cut off from that higher sphere?
- HoP 2",79
7940,"Those who despise that which is related thereto know it only in name
- HoP 2",76
7941,"How could it be pious to believe that Divine providence (πρόνοια) does not reach to matters here below?
- HoP 2",111
7942,"Why is God not also here?
- HoP 2",33
7943,"For how otherwise could He know what takes place within this sphere?
- HoP 2",76
7944,"Therefore He is universally present, and is in this world, in whatever way it be, so that the world participates in Him
- HoP 2",127
7945,"If He is at a distance from the world, He is at a distance also from us, and you could say nothing of Him or of what He produces
- HoP 2",136
7946,"This world also partakes of Him, and is not forsaken by Him, and never will be so
- HoP 2",89
7947,"For the whole partakes of the divine much more than the part does, and the world-soul shares in it to a still greater degree
- HoP 2",132
7949,"Severance, emanation, effluence or process, emergence, occurrence, are words which in modern times have also had to stand for much, but in fact nothing is expressed by them
- HoP 2",180
7950,"Scepticism and dogmatism, as consciousness or knowledge, establish the opposition of subjectivity and objectivity
- HoP 2",121
7953,"I quote one example only: our soul belongs not only to the sphere of the finite understanding, where it was perfect, happy, lacking nothing; its power of thought alone belongs to the first, the finite understanding
- HoP 2",222
7954,"Its power of motion, or itself looked on as life, had as its source the intelligent world-soul, but sensation had its source in the soul of the world of sensation
- HoP 2",170
7955,"That is to say, Plotinus makes the first world-soul to be the immediate activity of the finite understanding, which is an object to itself; it is pure soul above the sublunar region, and dwells in the upper heaven of the fixed stars
- HoP 2",240
7956,"This world-soul has power to originate; from it again there flows an entirely sensuous soul

7966,"Porphyry and Iamblichus, who have already been mentioned as the biographers of Pythagoras (Vol
- HoP 2",102
7967,"I p 197), are distinguished followers of Plotinus
- HoP 2",57
7968,"The first, a Syrian, died in 304: the latter, likewise of Syria, in the year 333246 Amongst other works by Porphyrius, we possess an “Introduction to the Organon of Aristotle on Genera, Species, and Judgments,” in which his logic is propounded in its principal elements
- HoP 2",277
7969,"This work is one which has at all times been the text-book of Aristotelian Logic, and also an authority from which the knowledge of its form has been derived; and our ordinary books of logic contain little more than what is found in this Introduction
- HoP 2",258
7970,"The fact that Porphyry devoted himself to logic shows that a determinate form of thought was coming into favour with the Neo-Platonists; but this is something pertaining altogether to the understanding and very formal
- HoP 2",225
7973,"It was likewise in the Pythagorean philosophy that the Neo-Platonists gloried, and more particularly they revived the form of number-determination which pertains to it
- HoP 2",175
7974,"In Iamblichus thought sinks into imagination, the intellectual universe to a kingdom of demons and angels with a classification of the same, and speculation comes down to the methods of magic
- HoP 2",199
7975,"The Neo-Platonists called this theurgy (θεουργία); for in the miracle speculation, the divine Idea, is, so to speak, brought into immediate contact with actuality, and not set forth in a universal way
- HoP 2",208
7976,"As to the work De mysteriis Ægyptiorum, it is not known for certain whether it had Iamblichus as its author or not; later on Proclus makes great ado concerning him, and testifies that he was indebted to Iamblichus for his main ideas247   4
- HoP 2",247
7977,"Proclus, a later Neo-Platonist who has still to be mentioned, is more important
- HoP 2",87
7978,"He was born in 412 at Constantinople, but carried on his studies and spent most of his life with Plutarchus in Athens, where he also died in 485
- HoP 2",152
7979,"His life is written by Marinus, in a style similar to that of the biographies just mentioned
- HoP 2",100
7980,"According to this his parents came from Xanthus in Lycia, a district of Asia Minor; and since Apollo and Minerva were the tutelary deities of this town, he rendered grateful worship to them
- HoP 2",197
7981,"They, themselves, vouchsafed to him, as their favourite, particular regard and personal manifestations; indeed, he was healed of an illness by Apollo touching his head; by Minerva, however, he was called upon to go to Athens
- HoP 2",232
7982,"First of all he went to Alexandria to study rhetoric and philosophy, and then to Athens, to be with Plutarchus and Syrianus, the Platonists
- HoP 2",147
7983,"Here he first studied Aristotelian and then Platonic philosophy
- HoP 2",71
7986,"Proclus is said to have had himself initiated into all the pagan mysteries
- HoP 2",82
7988,"Proclus himself composed many hymns—of which we still possess some that are very beautiful—both in honour of the better known divinities and of those whose fame is entirely local
- HoP 2",186
7990,"It was in Athens that he taught
- HoP 2",39
7993,"Proclus left behind him a great number of writings, many of which we now possess; he was the author of several mathematical works which we also have, such as that on the Sphere
- HoP 2",184
7994,"His more important philosophic works are the Commentaries on Plato’s Dialogues, certain of which have been published from time to time; that on the Timæus was the most famous
- HoP 2",182
7995,"But several were only found in manuscript, and of these Cousin issued in Paris the Commentaries on the Alcibiades (Vols
- HoP 2",127
7996,"The first volume of Cousin’s edition contains some writings by Proclus which now exist only in Latin, on Freedom, Providence, and Evil
- HoP 2",142
7997,"Proclus lived, so to speak, in the worship of science
- HoP 2",61
7998,"His philosophy, like that of Plotinus, has the form of a Commentary on Plato; his book “On the Theology of Plato,” is in this respect his most interesting work
- HoP 2",167
7999,"The main ideas of his philosophy may easily be recognized from this work, which possesses many difficulties for this reason in particular, that in it the pagan gods are considered, and philosophic significations derived from them
- HoP 2",237
8001,"His philosophy is an intellectual system; we must see how we can work it out
- HoP 2",84
8002,"His way of putting it is not perfectly clear, but leaves much to be desired
- HoP 2",83
8003,"Proclus differs first of all from Plotinus in not making Being his principle or purely abstract moment, but by beginning from unity, and for the first time understanding Being or subsistence as the third; thus to him everything has a much more concrete form
- HoP 2",265
8004,"But the self-development of this unity is not made the necessity of the Notion with Proclus any more than with Plotinus; we must once for all give up seeking here for the Notion of disunion
- HoP 2",197
8005,"The relation to difference of the unity which brings forth is, however, not an issuing forth from self, for an issuing forth would be a change, and unity would be posited as no more self-identical
- HoP 2",204
8007,"What distinguishes Plotinus is his more profound study of the Platonic dialectic; in this way he occupies himself in his Platonic theology with the most acute and far-reaching dialectic of the One
- HoP 2",204
8008,"It is necessary for him to demonstrate the many as one and the one as many, to show forth the forms which the One adopts
- HoP 2",128
8009,"But it is a dialectic which to a greater or less extent is externally worked out, and which is most wearisome
- HoP 2",117
8011,"Proclus now shows, according to the Platonic dialectic, how all determinations, and particularly that of multiplicity, are resolved into themselves and return into unity
- HoP 2",177
8013,"But since we now ascribe no substantiality, no proper Being to a thought, all such determinations are only moments of a thing in thought
- HoP 2",144
8015,"From this they say it by no means follows that all actual things are not actual substances, that they have not different principles independent of one another, and even that they are not different substances, each of which is separated from the other and in and for itself
- HoP 2",280
8018,"Respecting these negations (ἀποφάσεις) Proclus now says (Theol
- HoP 2",70
8019,"The mode (τρόπος) of negations is thus to be taken as perfection which remains in unity, issues forth from everything, and is in an inexpressible and ineffable preponderance of simplicity
- HoP 2",195
8020,"On the other hand, God must likewise be derived from these negations; else there would be no Notion (λόγος) of them, and also no negation
- HoP 2",145
8021,"The Notion of the inexpressible revolves round itself, never resting, and it strives with itself;” ie the one implies its determinations ideally, the whole is contained in the one
- HoP 2",187
8022,"Multiplicity is not taken empirically and then merely abrogated; the negative, as dividing, producing, and active, not merely contains what is privative, but also affirmative determinations
- HoP 2",197
8023,"In this way the Platonic dialectic wins for Proclus a positive significance; through dialectic he would lead all differences back to unity
- HoP 2",146
8024,"The submersion of everything in unity remains, however, merely beyond this unity, instead of which this very negativity must really be grasped as signifying its production
- HoP 2",179
8025,"That which brings forth, according to Proclus, furthermore brings forth through a superfluity of power
- HoP 2",110
8026,"There certainly also is a bringing forth through want; all need, all desire, for example, becomes cause through want; and its bringing forth is its satisfaction
- HoP 2",168
8027,"The end here is incomplete, and the energy arises from the endeavour to complete itself, so that only in production the need becomes less, the desire ceases to be such, or its abstract Being-for-self disappears
- HoP 2",218
8028,"Unity, on the other hand, goes forth out of itself through the superfluity of potentiality, and this superabundant potentiality is actuality generally: this reflection of Proclus is quite Aristotelian
- HoP 2",208
8029,"Hence the coming forth of the unity consists in the fact that it multiplies itself, pure number comes forth; but this multiplication does not negate or diminish that first unity, but rather takes place in the method of unity (ἑνιαίως)
- HoP 2",242
8030,"The many partakes of the unity, but the unity does not partake of multiplicity250 The absolute unity which multiplies itself into many ones has consequently generated multiplicity as it is in these ones
- HoP 2",210
8031,"Proclus makes use of a many-sided dialectic to show that the many does not exist in itself, is not the creator of the many, that everything goes back into unity, and thus unity is also the originator of the many
- HoP 2",219
8032,"It is, however, not made clear how this is the negative relation of the one to itself; what we see is then a manifold dialectic, which merely passes backwards and forwards over the relationship of the one to the many
- HoP 2",224
8033,"To Proclus an important characteristic of this progression is the fact that it takes place through analogy, and what is dissimilar to the truth is the further removed from the same
- HoP 2",188
8034,"The many partakes of unity, but it is in a measure likewise not one, but dissimilar to one
- HoP 2",98
8035,"But since the many is also similar to what produces it, it likewise has unity as its essence; hence the many are independent unities (ἑνάδες)
- HoP 2",149
8036,"They contain the principle of unity within themselves, for if as being many they are likewise different, they are, so to speak, only many for a third, being in and for themselves unities
- HoP 2",194
8037,"These unities again beget others which must, however, be less perfect, for the effect is not exactly like the cause, that which is brought forth is not quite similar to what brings it forth
- HoP 2",197
8038,"These next unities are wholes, ie, they are no longer real unities, unities in themselves, since in them the unity is only an accident
- HoP 2",142
8039,"But because things themselves are in their synthetic nature merely wholes because their souls bind them together, they are dissimilar to the first unity, and cannot be immediately united to it
- HoP 2",200
8040,"The abstractly conceived multiplicity is thus their mean; multiplicity is analogous to absolute unity, and is that which unites unity with the whole universe
- HoP 2",165
8041,"Pure multiplicity makes the different elements like one another, and hence unites them to unity; but things only have similarity to unity
- HoP 2",145
8042,"Thus things that are begotten ever remove themselves more and more from unity, and partake of it less and less251  The further determination of the Idea is known as the trinity (τριάς)
- HoP 2",192
8043,"Of this Proclus (Theol
- HoP 2",30
8044,"This trinity is certainly interesting in the Neo-Platonists, but it is specially so in the case of Proclus, because he did not leave it in its abstract moments
- HoP 2",167
8045,"For he again considers these three abstract determinations of the absolute, each on its own account, as a totality of triunity, whereby he obtains one real trinity
- HoP 2",171
8047,"Because each of these differences in the Idea, as remaining in unity with itself, is really again the whole of these moments, there are different orders in production; and the whole is the process of the three totalities establishing themselves in one another as identical
- HoP 2",280
8048,"It will be shown directly which orders these are, and Proclus occupies himself much with these, because he tries to demonstrate the different powers again in them
- HoP 2",170
8049,"Proclus is hence much more detailed, and he went much further than did Plotinus; it may indeed be said that in this respect we find in him the most excellent and best that was formulated by any of the Neo-Platonists
- HoP 2",223
8050,"As regards the further details of his trinity there are, according to his account, three abstract moments present in it, which are worked out in his Platonic theology—the one, the infinite and the limitation; the last two we have likewise seen in Plato (p 68)
- HoP 2",267
8051,"The first, God, is just the absolute unity already frequently discussed, which by itself is unknowable and undisclosed, because it is a mere abstraction; it can only be known that it is an abstraction, since it is not yet activity
- HoP 2",238
8052,"This unity is the super-substantial (ὑπερούσιον), and in the second place its first production is the many ones (ἑνάδες) of things, pure numbers
- HoP 2",152
8053,"In these we have the thinking principles of things, through which they partake of absolute unity; but each partakes of it only through a single individual unity, through the one, while souls do so through thought-out, universal unities
- HoP 2",243
8054,"To this Proclus refers the forms of ancient mythology
- HoP 2",61
8055,"That is to say, as he calls that first unity God, he calls these numerous unities of thought that flow from it, gods, but the following moments are likewise so called
- HoP 2",174
8056,"He says, (Institut
- HoP 2",26
8057,"For everything divine is inexpressible on its own account and unknowable as forming part of the inexpressible one; but from differentiation, from change, it comes to pass that we know its characteristics
- HoP 2",211
8058,"Thus there are gods capable of being known, which radiate true Being; hence true Being is the knowable divine, and the incommunicable is made manifest for the νοῦς” But there always remains a compulsion to represent mythology in the determinateness of the Notion
- HoP 2",270
8059,"These gods or unities do not correspond to the order of things in such a way that there are just as many and such unities (ἑνάδες) or gods as there are things; for these unities only unite things with the absolute unity
- HoP 2",227
8061,"But to such abstractions the name gods is not applicable, for it is as returning that we first of all see them as divine
- HoP 2",128
8062,"Proclus says (Theol
- HoP 2",27
8064,"In all opposition which is found in species that are divine, what is more excellent belongs to limitation, and what is less excellent to the infinite
- HoP 2",157
8065,"From these two principles everything derives its progress until it steps forth into Being
- HoP 2",97
8066,"Thus the eternal, in so far as it is measure as intellectual, partakes of limitation, but in so far as it is the cause of unceasing effort after Being, of infinitude
- HoP 2",173
8068,"Now according to Proclus (Theol
- HoP 2",39
8069,"Now if we consider further the nature of what is mingled we find the three triads likewise, for each of those three abstract principles is itself a similar complete triad, but under one or these particular forms
- HoP 2",219
8070,"Proclus says (Theol
- HoP 2",27
8071,"The first of what is mingled is the first of all existence, the life and the spirit are the two other orders; everything is consequently in triads
- HoP 2",154
8072,"These three triads determine themselves thus as absolute Being, life and spirit; and they are spiritual and to be grasped in thought” According to this only the intelligible world is true for Proclus
- HoP 2",207
8073,"But that Proclus did not make the understanding proceed immediately from the unity, is the second point in which he differs from Plotinus; in this Proclus is more logical, and he follows Plato more closely
- HoP 2",213
8074,"His sequence is excellent, and he is right in placing the understanding, as the richer, last, since it is not until after the development of the moments which are present in life that the understanding springs forth, and from it in turn the soul253 Proclus says (Theol
- HoP 2",276
8075,"As a matter of fact we find more distinction and clearness in Proclus than in the turbidity of Plotinus; he is quite correct in recognizing the νοῦς as the third, for it is, that which turns back
- HoP 2",203
8076,"Regarding the relationship of the three orders Proclus now expresses himself in the passage already quoted (Theol
- HoP 2",121
8077,"But the understanding is the limit of the existent, and it is thought as known (ὁ νοητὸς νοῦς), for in what is thought is thinking, and in thinking what is thought
- HoP 2",171
8078,"But in what is thought thinking is in the mode of thought (νοητῶς), in thinking what is thought is in the mode of thinking (νοερῶς)
- HoP 2",139
8081,"The understanding itself is that which knows, but life is thinking, and Being is just what is thought
- HoP 2",109
8082,"Now if the whole of what exists is mingled, but the first existence (τὸ αὐτοόν) is substance, the substance that comes from the three principles (ὑφισταμένε) is mingled
- HoP 2",176
8083,"What is mingled is thus substance as thought; it is from God, from whom also come the infinite and limitation
- HoP 2",117
8084,"There are thus four moments, since what is mingled is the fourth” The first is the monad, the absolute one, then come the many which themselves are units, the infinite of Plato; the third is limitation
- HoP 2",209
8085,"The one is clearly all-penetrating, remaining at home with itself, all-embracing; it does not thus appear as one of the three moments, for Proclus adds a fourth which then likewise appears as the third moment, since it is the totality
- HoP 2",242
8086,"The limit and the infinite are, according to Proclus (Theol
- HoP 2",67
8087,"In the abstract trinity everything is thus contained in itself
- HoP 2",70
8088,"Proclus says (Theol
- HoP 2",27
8090,"The limit is God going forth to the culminating point of thought from the uncommunicable and first God, measuring and determining everything, admitting all that is paternal and coherent, and the unblemished race of gods
- HoP 2",227
8091,"But the infinite” (quantity) “is the inexhaustible potentiality of this God, that which makes all productions and orders to appear, and the whole infinitude, the primeval essence as well as the substantial, and even the ultimate matter
- HoP 2",243
8093,"It is the greatest height reached by thought and likewise really the turning back, as this likewise appears in Plotinus; and this first begets in its culminating point the second order which in the whole is life, and culminates in its turn in the νοῦς
- HoP 2",259
8094,"This second triad is placed in the determination of the infinite
- HoP 2",72
8095,"On making this step forward Proclus (Theol
- HoP 2",50
8097,"The unity of both these is Life (ζωή),” the centre, or what gives determinateness to the whole order; “the second existence is life as thought, for in the most external thought Ideas have their subsistence (ὑπόστασιν)
- HoP 2",225
8099,"Limitation determines the first trinity, the unlimited the second, the concrete (μικτόν) the third
- HoP 2",106
8101,"This third triad does not resemble cause (κατ̓ αἰτίαν), like the first existence, nor does it reveal the all like the second; but it is all as act and expression (ἐκφανῶς); hence it is also the limit of all that is thought
- HoP 2",230
8102,"The first triad remains concealed in limit itself, and has all subsistence of intellectuality fixed in it
- HoP 2",113
8103,"The second is likewise enduring, and at the same time steps forward;” the living appears, but is in so doing led back to unity
- HoP 2",134
8104,"And all this is one thought, one Idea: persistence, progression and return” Each is a totality on its own account, but all three are led back into one
- HoP 2",158
8105,"In the νοῦς the first two triads are themselves only moments; for spirit is just the grasping in itself of the totality of the first two spheres
- HoP 2",152
8106,"The expression “mystic” often appears with the Neo-Platonists
- HoP 2",69
8107,"Thus Proclus for example says (Theol
- HoP 2",44
8108,"However, μυστήριον has not to the Alexandrians the meaning that it has to us, for to them it indicates speculative philosophy generally
- HoP 2",143
8109,"The mysteries in Christianity have likewise been to the understanding an incomprehensible secret, but because they are speculative, reason comprehends them, and they are not really secret, for they have been revealed
- HoP 2",224
8110,"In conclusion, Proclus institutes a comparison between these triads
- HoP 2",75
8112,"The individuality of consciousness is partially in the form of an actuality, as magic and theurgy; this often appears among the Neo-Platonists and with Proclus, and is called making a god
- HoP 2",195
8113,"The element of theurgy is thus brought into relation with the heathen divinities: “The first and chief names of the gods, one must admit, are founded in the gods themselves
- HoP 2",180
8114,"Divine thought makes names of its thoughts, and finally shows the images of the gods; each name gives rise, so to speak, to an image of a god
- HoP 2",149
8116,"This connecting fact—that the Neo-Platonists have even inspired the mythical element with the divine—is thereby expressed, so that in images, &c, the divine power is present
- HoP 2",181
8117,"Nevertheless I have only wished to call this moment to mind because it plays a great part at this particular time
- HoP 2",121
8118,"In Proclus we have the culminating point of the Neo-Platonic philosophy; this method in philosophy is carried into later times, continuing even through the whole of the Middle Ages
- HoP 2",188
8119,"Proclus had several successors who were scholarchs at Athens—Marinus, his biographer, and then Isidorus of Gaza, and finally Damascius
- HoP 2",142
8120,"Of the latter we still possess some very interesting writings; he was the last teacher of the Neo-Platonic philosophy in the Academy
- HoP 2",140
8121,"For in 529 AD the Emperor Justinian caused this school to be closed, and drove all heathen philosophers from his kingdom: amongst these was Simplicius, a celebrated commentator on Aristotle, several of whose commentaries are not yet printed
- HoP 2",248
8122,"They sought and found protection and freedom in Persia under Chosroïs
- HoP 2",77
8124,"Although the Neo-Platonic school ceased to exist outwardly, ideas of the Neo-Platonists, and specially the philosophy of Proclus, were long maintained and preserved in the Church; and later on we shall on several occasions refer to it
- HoP 2",242
8125,"In the earlier, purer, mystical scholastics we find the same ideas as are seen in Proclus, and until comparatively recent times, when in the Catholic Church God is spoken of in a profound and mystical way, the ideas expressed are Neo-Platonic
- HoP 2",250
8127,"Here we witness a great revolution, and with this the first period, that of Greek philosophy, closes
- HoP 2",108
8128,"The Greek principle is freedom as beauty, reconciliation in imagination, natural free reconciliation that is immediately realized, and thus represents an Idea in sensuous guise
- HoP 2",184
8129,"Through philosophy thought, however, desires to tear itself away from what is sensuous, for philosophy is the constitution of thought into a totality beyond the sensuous and the imaginary
- HoP 2",195
8130,"Herein is this simple progression contained, and the points of view which we have noticed are, as cursorily surveyed, the following
- HoP 2",139
8131,"First of all we saw the abstract in natural form: then abstract thought in its immediacy, and thus the one, Being
- HoP 2",121
8132,"These are pure thoughts, but thought is not yet comprehended as thought; for us these thoughts are merely universal thoughts to which the consciousness of thought is still lacking
- HoP 2",187
8133,"Socrates is the second stage, in which thought appears as self, the absolute is the thought of itself; the content is not only determined, eg Being, the atom, but is concrete thought, determined in itself and subjective
- HoP 2",227
8134,"The self is the most simple form of the concrete, but it is still devoid of content; in as far as it is determined it is concrete, like the Platonic Idea
- HoP 2",161
8135,"This content, however, is only implicitly concrete and is not yet known as such; Plato, beginning with what is given, takes the more determinate content out of sensuous perception
- HoP 2",187
8136,"Aristotle attains to the highest idea; the thought about thought takes the highest place of all; but the content of the world is still outside of it
- HoP 2",156
8137,"Now in as far as this manifold concrete is led back to the self as to the ultimate simple unity of the concrete, or, on the other hand, the abstract principle has content given to it, we saw the systems of dogmatism arising
- HoP 2",231
8138,"That thought of thought is in Stoicism the principle of the whole world, and it has made the attempt to comprehend the world as thought
- HoP 2",143
8139,"Scepticism, on the other hand, denies all content, for it is self-consciousness, thought, in its pure solitude with itself, and likewise reflection on that beginning of pre-suppositions
- HoP 2",193
8140,"In the third place the absolute is known as concrete, and this is as far as Greek philosophy goes
- HoP 2",105
8142,"But each sphere is a trinity in itself, so that each of the abstract moments of this triad is itself likewise grasped as a totality
- HoP 2",139
8143,"Only that which manifests itself, and therein retains itself as the one, is held to be true
- HoP 2",99
8145,"The Neo-Platonic standpoint is thus not a philosophic freak, but a forward advance on the part of the human mind, the world and the world-spirit
- HoP 2",152
8146,"The revelation of God has not come to it as from an alien source
- HoP 2",72
8147,"What we here consider so dry and abstract is concrete
- HoP 2",61
8148,"The philosophers are in so doing nearer to God than those nurtured upon spiritual crumbs; they read or write the orders as they receive them in the original; they are obliged to continue writing on
- HoP 2",205
8149,"Philosophers are the initiated ones—those who have taken part in the advance which has been made into the inmost sanctuary; others have their particular interests—this dominion, these riches, this girl
- HoP 2",209
8150,"Hundreds and thousands of years are required by the world-spirit to reach the point which we attain more quickly, because we have the advantage of having objects which are past and of dealing with abstraction
- HoP 2",216
8151,"The second period extends to the sixteenth century, and thus again embraces a thousand years, to pass over which we must provide ourselves with seven-leagued boots
- HoP 3",171
8152,"While Philosophy has hitherto found its place in the religion of the heathen, from this time on it has its sphere within the Christian world; for Arabians and Jews have only to be noticed in an external and historic way
- HoP 3",227
8153,"Through the Neo-Platonic philosophy we have come into quite familiar acquaintance with the Idea of Christianity, as the new religion which has entered into the world
- HoP 3",173
8154,"For the Neo-Platonic philosophy has as its essential principle the fact that the Absolute is determined as spirit in a concrete way, that God is not a mere conception
- HoP 3",174
8155,"Although the Absolute is Thought, it must, in order to be true, be concrete in itself and not abstract; in what we have just seen we have, then, the first appearance of the absolutely existent spirit
- HoP 3",207
8156,"But in spite of their profound and true speculation, the Neo-Platonists still had not proved their doctrine that the Trinity is the truth, for there is lacking to it the form of inward necessity
- HoP 3",202
8157,"The Neo-Platonists begin from the One that determines itself, that sets a limit to itself from which the determinate proceeds; this, however, is itself an immediate method of presentation, and it is this that makes such philosophers as Plotinus and Proclus so tiresome
- HoP 3",276
8158,"Undoubtedly dialectic considerations enter in, in which the opposites which are conceived as absolute are shown to be null; but this dialectic is not methodical, but occurs only disconnectedly
- HoP 3",200
8160,"To them spirit is thus not individual spirit; and this deficiency is made good through Christianity, in which spirit is found as actual, present spirit, immediately existent in the world here and now, and the absolute spirit is known in the immediate present as man
- HoP 3",273
8162,"Man must be qualified to have this truth present to him; he must further be convinced of this possibility
- HoP 3",113
8163,"This is the absolute demand and necessity; the consciousness must be arrived at that this alone is true
- HoP 3",111
8166,"Hence the doctrine of reconciliation is that God is known as reconciling Himself with the world, ie as we have seen in the Neo-Platonic philosophy, that He particularizes Himself and does not remain abstract
- HoP 3",215
8167,"Not external nature alone, but the whole world pertains to the particular; above all must human individuality know itself in God
- HoP 3",136
8168,"The interest of the subject is itself involved, and here it plays an essential rôle in order that God may be realized and may realize Himself in the consciousness of individuals who are spirit and implicitly free
- HoP 3",220
8169,"Thus through the process these accomplish that reconciliation in themselves, actualize their freedom; that is to say, they attain to the consciousness of heaven upon earth, the elevation of man to God
- HoP 3",208
8170,"Thus the true intellectual world is not a beyond, but the so-called finite is an element in it, and no division exists between this side and that
- HoP 3",153
8171,"The real concrete in regard to the absolute Idea is the knowing of the mundane, the ‘other’ in God, as implicitly divine, as universal, as the world of intellect, as having its root in God, but only the root
- HoP 3",215
8172,"In God man is accepted only in his truth, and not in his immediacy, and thus this doctrine is not what we call Pantheism, for that leaves the immediate just as it is
- HoP 3",173
8173,"Man then has himself to accomplish the process of reconciliation in himself in order to attain to his truth
- HoP 3",115
8174,"We have thus seen that man possesses the determination and attributes of God as the first begotten son, Adam Kadmon, the first man; we may call this unity the concrete Idea, which, however, is still only implicit
- HoP 3",220
8175,"But the fact that because man is capable of the divine, the identity of the divine and human nature must likewise be present for him, has in an immediate way become known to him in Christ, as one in whom the divine and human nature are implicitly one
- HoP 3",258
8176,"In the world what has come to pass is that the Absolute has been revealed as the concrete, and, further, not only in thought in a general way as intelligible world, but because it has in itself proceeded to its ultimate point of intensity
- HoP 3",246
8177,"Thus it is an actual self, an “I,” the absolute universal, the concrete universal, that is God; and also the absolute opposite of this determination, the clearly finite as it exists in space and time, but this finite determined in unity with the eternal as self
- HoP 3",269
8178,"The Absolute comprehended as concrete, the unity of these two absolutely different determinations, is the true God; each of them is abstract, and either of them taken by itself is thus not the true God
- HoP 3",209
8179,"The fact that the concrete is thus known to men in this perfection as God, brings about the whole revolution that has taken place in the world’s history
- HoP 3",160
8180,"The Trinity is thereby not only present in conception, which would not yet constitute the perfect concrete, but actuality is perfectly united to it
- HoP 3",155
8181,"In the consciousness of the world it has consequently broken in upon men that the Absolute has attained to this “culminating point” of immediate actuality, as Proclus says; and that is the manifestation of Christianity
- HoP 3",226
8182,"The Greeks were anthropomorphic, their gods were humanly constituted; but the deficiency in them is that they were not anthropomorphic enough
- HoP 3",149
8184,"Thus man reaches this truth, because for him it becomes a sure intuition that in Christ the λόγος has become Flesh
- HoP 3",122
8185,"Now since man really is this process of being the negation of the immediate, and from this negation attaining to himself—to a unity with God—he must consequently renounce his natural will, knowledge, and existence
- HoP 3",221
8186,"This giving up of his natural existence is witnessed in Christ’s sufferings and death, and in His resurrection and elevation to the right hand of the Father
- HoP 3",164
8187,"Christ became a perfect man, endured the lot of all men, death; as man He suffered, sacrificed Himself, gave up His natural existence, and thereby elevated Himself above it
- HoP 3",180
8188,"In Him this process, this conversion of His other-being into spirit, and the necessity of pain in the renunciation of the natural man is witnessed; but this pain, the pain of feeling that God Himself is dead, is the starting point of holiness and of elevation to God
- HoP 3",274
8189,"Thus what must come to pass in the subject—this process, this conversion of the finite—is known as implicitly accomplished in Christ
- HoP 3",140
8190,"This constitutes the great leading Idea of Christianity
- HoP 3",63
8191,"From what has been said it follows, in the second place, that the world must not be left in its immediate naturalness
- HoP 3",125
8192,"The original, implicitly existent, is found only in the strictest conception of mind, or as its determination: immediately, man is only a living being, who has indeed the capacity to become actual spirit—but spirit does not pertain to nature
- HoP 3",249
8193,"Man is thus not by nature this particular in which the spirit of God lives and dwells: man is not by nature what he ought to be
- HoP 3",135
8194,"The animal is by nature what it ought to be
- HoP 3",51
8195,"But what has to be noticed in this respect is that natural things merely remain in their implicit Notion, or their truth does not enter into their sensuous life, for this their natural individuality is only a fleeting fact that cannot look back on itself
- HoP 3",262
8198,"Thus consciousness does not signify remaining in the sphere of nature, but the existence of the process whereby the universal becomes object or end to man
- HoP 3",162
8199,"Man makes himself divine, but in a spiritual, that is to say not in an immediate way
- HoP 3",92
8200,"In the ancient religions the divine is also united to the natural or human; but this unity is no reconciliation, but an immediate, undeveloped, and thus unspiritual unity, just because it is merely natural
- HoP 3",213
8201,"But because mind is not natural but only that into which it makes itself, the spiritual is first met with in this very process of producing unity
- HoP 3",153
8202,"To this spiritual unity pertains the negation of nature, of the flesh, as that in which man must not rest; for nature is from the beginning evil
- HoP 3",152
8203,"Man is likewise naturally evil, for all the wickedness that man does proceeds from a natural desire
- HoP 3",107
8204,"Now because man is in himself the image of God, but in existence is only natural, that which is implicit must be evolved, while the first natural condition must be abrogated
- HoP 3",181
8207,"In order to bring about the conclusion that this is the historic idea of Christianity, we should have to enter upon an historic disquisition; but because we cannot deal with this here, we must accept it as an historic axiom
- HoP 3",231
8208,"On the other hand, in so far as this question falls within the history of Philosophy, the assertion that this is the idea of Christianity has another ground to stand on than that of history, and this constitutes the third point of interest
- HoP 3",247
8209,"In connection with the preceding forms it has been shown that this Idea of Christianity must have now come forth, and indeed become the universal consciousness of the nations
- HoP 3",182
8210,"The fact that it has come forth as the world-religion, is the content of history; it is this necessity in the Idea which has to be expounded more clearly in the philosophy of history
- HoP 3",190
8212,"The recognition of this necessity has been called the à priori construction of history; there is no good in decrying it as inadmissible, and indeed as arrogant
- HoP 3",167
8213,"The development of history may be represented as contingent
- HoP 3",67
8214,"Or, if the providence and government of God are seriously accepted, these are represented as though Christianity were so to speak ready made in the mind of God; then, when thrust into the world, it appears to be contingent
- HoP 3",230
8215,"But the rationality and likewise the necessity of this decree of God’s has now to be considered, and this may be called a theodicy, a justification of God, ie a vindication of our Idea
- HoP 3",192
8217,"It is this which is shown forth in temporal history, and as history, indeed, just because mind is the living movement, proceeding from its immediate existence to beget revolutions in the world, as well as in individuals
- HoP 3",227
8218,"Since it is hereby presupposed that this Idea must necessarily become universal religion, there is, in the fourth place, present in it the source of a method of knowledge proper to the particular consciousness
- HoP 3",217
8219,"That is to say, the new religion has made the intelligible world of Philosophy the world of common consciousness
- HoP 3",120
8222,"That through which this Idea appears as religion, belongs, however, to the history of religion, and this development of its form must here be passed over
- HoP 3",161
8225,"Through this original sin, it is further signified, man has drawn upon himself the wrath of God
- HoP 3",103
8226,"Now if these forms be adhered to, we have in the first place there the first parents in time, and not in thought; but the thought of these first parents is none other than man as he is in and for himself
- HoP 3",211
8228,"But it is again not merely represented that he simply partook of the fruit, but that he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; it is as man that he must partake of it, and not as beast
- HoP 3",204
8229,"The fundamental characteristic, however, through which he distinguishes himself from the animal, is the very fact that he knows what good and evil are
- HoP 3",158
8231,"The second point is that man is by nature evil and transmits the evil
- HoP 3",77
8232,"On the other hand, it is said: “Why should the sinner suffer punishment seeing that there is no responsibility for what is inborn in him?” As a matter of fact the statement that man is implicitly or by nature evil would seem to be a hard saying
- HoP 3",252
8234,"The abrogation of mere naturalness is known to us simply as education, and arises of itself; through education subjection is brought about, and with that a capacity for becoming good is developed
- HoP 3",203
8235,"Now if this appears to come to pass very easily, we must recollect that it is of infinite importance that the reconciliation of the world with itself, the making good, is brought about through the simple method of education
- HoP 3",231
8236,"This task once more falls into three separate divisions
- HoP 3",63
8237,"In the first place we have the dissemination of the Christian religion and the bringing of it within the hearts of men; this, however, lies outside the limits of our consideration
- HoP 3",187
8238,"The heart signifies the subjective man as ‘this,’ and through this principle the latter has a different position from before; it is essential that this subject should be present
- HoP 3",185
8239,"The individual subject is the object of divine grace; each subject, or man as man, has on his own account an infinite value, is destined to partake of this spirit which must, as God, be born within the heart of every man
- HoP 3",228
8240,"Man is determined for freedom, he is here recognized as implicitly free; this freedom is, however, at first only formal, because it remains within the principle of subjectivity
- HoP 3",184
8242,"For the philosophic Idea is the Idea of God, and thought has the absolute right of reconciliation, or the right to claim that the Christian principle should correspond with thought
- HoP 3",188
8243,"The Fathers have rendered the service of thus elaborating the Christian religion in thinking knowledge; but neither have we to consider further this development of the Christian principle, since it belongs to the history of the Church
- HoP 3",242
8244,"We have only here to give the point of view adopted regarding the relation of the Fathers to Philosophy
- HoP 3",111
8245,"They for the most part lived within the ancient Roman world and in Latin culture, though the Byzantines likewise are included with them
- HoP 3",143
8249,"Hence at the time of the Reformation no particular system was built up, but what was originally there was purified from later additions; it is a complicated erection, in which the most intricate pieces of workmanship are to be found
- HoP 3",240
8251,"As regards the title of Philosophy and the Fathers to bring Philosophy into Christianity we have the following remarks to make
- HoP 3",134
8254,"This signifies that it is the conceptions which we bring along with us which have in the letter to give efficacy to themselves
- HoP 3",134
8255,"Now these reflections brought along with us may be grasped by the most ordinary human understanding, which is what is indicated in modern times when we say that dogmas must be popular
- HoP 3",191
8256,"In that way the right to act upon the letter with the spirit is assumed, ie the right to approach it with our individual judgment; but to the Fathers this is forbidden
- HoP 3",175
8257,"They did act upon it with the Spirit; and it is expressly said that the Spirit dwells within the Church, directs, teaches, and illuminates it
- HoP 3",149
8258,"The Fathers have hence a similar right to relate themselves with the Spirit to the positive, to what is given by the senses
- HoP 3",131
8259,"Only it will depend absolutely upon what the nature of the Spirit is, for spirits are very different
- HoP 3",108
8260,"The assertion that the spirit must give life to the mere letter is certainly more definitely stated as that spirit has only to expound what is given, ie it must leave the actual sense of what is immediately contained in the words
- HoP 3",237
8261,"We must, however, be far behind in culture if we do not see the fallacy in the attitude here adopted
- HoP 3",108
8262,"To expound without the individual spirit, as though the sense were one entirely given, is impossible
- HoP 3",108
8263,"To elucidate signifies to make clear, and it must be made clear to me; this can be done by nothing excepting what was already present in me
- HoP 3",147
8264,"It must be in conformity with my subjective judgment, the necessities of my knowledge, of my apprehension, of my heart, &c; thus only is it for me
- HoP 3",154
8265,"It is hence very difficult to make clear to ourselves those foreign religions which lie far below our spiritual needs; but yet they touch a side of my spiritual necessities and standpoints, although it is but a dim and sensuous side
- HoP 3",240
8267,"Thus have men made of the Bible what may be called a nose of wax
- HoP 3",72
8268,"This man finds this thing, the other man that; what was secure now shows itself as insecure, because it is considered by the subjective spirit
- HoP 3",150
8270,"This also is expressly said in the text itself
- HoP 3",54
8271,"Christ says: “If I depart, I will send the Comforter, the Holy Ghost
- HoP 3",76
8272,"He will guide you into all truth,” He—and not Christ’s earthly presence nor His spoken words
- HoP 3",100
8273,"It was only to be after Him, and after His teaching through the text, that the Spirit was to come into the Apostles, and that they were to become full of the Spirit
- HoP 3",172
8274,"It might almost be said that when Christianity is carried back to its first appearing, it is brought down to the level of unspirituality, for Christ Himself says that the Spirit will not come until He Himself has departed
- HoP 3",229
8276,"His friends have seen Him, heard His doctrine, seen His miracles, and have thereby been brought to believe in Him
- HoP 3",121
8277,"But Christ Himself sternly rebukes those who demand miracles of Him; if He thus be made as God to man, God in the heart of man, He cannot have a sensuous and immediate presence
- HoP 3",184
8278,"The Dalai-lama, in the form of a sensuous man, is God to the inhabitants of Thibet, but in the Christian principle, where God dwells in the hearts of men, He cannot be present to them in sensuous form
- HoP 3",208
8279,"The second point then is that the sensuous and present form must disappear, so that it may be taken into the Mnemosyne, into the realm of popular conception; then for the first time can the spiritual consciousness, the spiritual relation, enter in
- HoP 3",255
8280,"To the question of whither Christ has gone, the answer is given, “He sits on the right hand of God,” which signifies that it is only now that God can be known as this concrete One, as the One who has the other moment, His Son (λόγος, σοφία), in Himself
- HoP 3",260
8281,"Thus to know what is the principle of Christianity as truth, the truth of the Idea of spirit must be known as concrete spirit, and this is the form peculiar to the Fathers of the Church
- HoP 3",193
8282,"This other moment in the divine must not, however, be grasped in the mode of an intelligible world, or, as we certainly have it in the ordinary conception, of a kingdom of heaven with many angels, who are also finite, limited, thus approaching closer to humanity
- HoP 3",270
8283,"But it is not sufficient that the concrete moment should be known in God, for the further knowledge is requisite that Christ is an actual present man
- HoP 3",157
8284,"This moment of Christ’s actual present humanity is of immense importance to Christianity, because it is the union of the most tremendous opposites
- HoP 3",154
8285,"This higher conception could not have been present in the text, in the first manifestation; the greatness of the Idea could only come in later on, after the Spirit had perfected the Idea
- HoP 3",194
8286,"That the revelation of Christ has this significance is the belief of Christians, while the profane, immediate and direct significance of this history is that Christ was a mere prophet and met the fate of all the prophets in being misunderstood
- HoP 3",251
8287,"But the fact that it has the significance given by us is known through the Spirit, for the Spirit is revealed in this history
- HoP 3",133
8288,"This history is the Notion, the Idea of Spirit itself, and the world-history has in it found its end, which is in this immediate way to know the truth
- HoP 3",158
8289,"It is therefore the Spirit which so comprehends that history, and at the time of Pentecost this is shown in an immediate and evident manner
- HoP 3",147
8290,"For before this time the Apostles did not know the infinite significance of Christ; they did not yet know that this is the infinite history of God; they had believed in Him, but not yet as seeing in Him this infinite truth
- HoP 3",230
8291,"This is the truth which the Fathers developed; the general relation of the first Christian Church to Philosophy is hereby given
- HoP 3",135
8293,"These two elements are essentially intermingled in this Christian system, the Idea itself, and secondly the form as it presents itself through its connection with a single individuality present in time and space
- HoP 3",219
8294,"To the Fathers this history had thus the Idea as its principle; the true Idea of the Spirit was consequently to them likewise in the determinate form of history
- HoP 3",168
8295,"But the Idea was not yet, as such, separated from history; because the Church thus held to this Idea in historic form, it determined the doctrines
- HoP 3",154
8296,"This, then, is the general character of the time
- HoP 3",56
8297,"From this Idea as comprehended through the Spirit, many so-called heresies arose in the first centuries after Christ
- HoP 3",124
8298,"Among such heretics must be included those of the Gnostics who take the Christian literature as their basis, but give a spiritual significance to everything therein present
- HoP 3",180
8299,"For they did not remain at this historical form of the Idea of Spirit, since they interpreted the history and deprived it of its historical value
- HoP 3",153
8300,"The reflections which they introduced are, as we have seen (Vol
- HoP 3",71
8301,"In conformity with their principles they adopted a speculative attitude, but they proceeded into extravagances both of the imagination and morality, although in this dim fantastic region the elements which we found in history may always be recognized
- HoP 3",258
8302,"But the form of immediate existence, an essential moment in Christ, is by them etherealized into a universal thought, so that the determination of the individual as a ‘this’ disappears
- HoP 3",192
8303,"The Docetæ, for example, said that Christ had only a phantom body, a phantom life; yet in such assertions thought still constituted the background
- HoP 3",154
8304,"From the East other forms of opposition in the principles than those we mentioned in connection with the Gnostics have been introduced, namely, Light and Darkness, Good and Evil
- HoP 3",185
8305,"But more particularly has this Parsee opposition emerged in Manichæism, in which God, as the Light opposes the evil, non-existent (οὐκ ὄν), the ὕλη, the material, self-annihilating
- HoP 3",188
8308,"That is the world-soul (ψυχὴ ἁπάντων); it was swallowed up by the material, and this intermixture is the basis of the whole creation
- HoP 3",140
8310,"This captive soul Mani likewise called the Son of Man—that is, of the primitive man, the heavenly man, of Adam Kadmon
- HoP 3",125
8311,"But only a part of the Light-principle which was destined to strive with the Kingdom of Evil is in this manner delivered over; being too weak, it incurred the danger of being vanquished, and had to deliver over to matter a part of its armour, this soul
- HoP 3",260
8313,"But that delivering soul remains in the second and visible light which is still distinguished from the first and unapproachable, having its seat there, and by means of sun and moon exercising influence in the purification of nature
- HoP 3",239
8314,"To Mani the whole course of the physical as of the spiritual world appears as a process of purification by means of this soul
- HoP 3",133
8315,"The captive principle of Light required to be raised from the cycle of metempsychosis to an immediate re-union with the Kingdom of Light
- HoP 3",144
8316,"Hence the pure heavenly soul came down to earth and appeared in the semblance of human form in order to reach to the suffering soul (to the νοῦς παθητικός of Aristotle?)
- HoP 3",177
8317,"The Manichæans also express themselves to the effect that God, the Good, goes forth, illumines, and thus produces an intelligible world
- HoP 3",143
8318,"What comes third is Spirit as turning round, establishing the unity of the second and first, and experiencing feeling, and this feeling is Love
- HoP 3",151
8319,"This heresy fully recognizes the Idea, but does away with the form of individual existence in which the Idea is presented in the Christian religion
- HoP 3",155
8320,"The crucifixion of Christ is consequently taken as merely a semblance, as allegorical only, simply an image
- HoP 3",115
8321,"That merely phantom crucifixion of the non-suffering Jesus, the fellow-suffering, only imaginary certainly, of the soul unmingled with matter, shows forth the actual suffering of the captive soul
- HoP 3",203
8322,"Thus as the forces of Darkness could exercise no power over Christ, they must also show themselves powerless over the soul allied thereto
- HoP 3",145
8323,"With the Manichæans originates the conception of a Jesus who is crucified in all the world and in the soul; the crucifixion of Christ thus mystically signifies only the wounds of our suffering souls
- HoP 3",206
8324,"Through vegetation the particles of light were held fast, and thus held fast they were brought forth as plants
- HoP 3",118
8325,"The earth becoming fruitful brings forth the suffering (patibilis) Jesus, who is the life and salvation of men and is crucified on every tree
- HoP 3",149
8326,"The νοῦς which appeared in Jesus signifies all things2 The Church has likewise made a principal point of asserting the unity of the divine and human nature
- HoP 3",163
8327,"But because this unity in the Christian religion attained to conceiving consciousness, human nature was in its actuality taken as ‘this,’ and not merely in an allegorical or philosophic sense
- HoP 3",199
8329,"They took Christ to be a man, accorded to Him indeed a higher nature, not, however, making Him a moment of God, of Spirit itself
- HoP 3",136
8330,"The Arians did not indeed go so far as the Socinians, who accepted Christ merely as a man of noble nature, a teacher, and so on; this sect hence did not form part of the Church at all, being simply heathen
- HoP 3",213
8331,"But still the Arians, since they did not recognize God in Christ, did away with the idea of the Trinity, and consequently with the principle of all speculative philosophy
- HoP 3",178
8333,"The Pelagians again, denied original sin, and maintained that man has by nature sufficient virtue and religion
- HoP 3",118
8334,"But man should not be what he is by nature; he should be spiritual
- HoP 3",74
8335,"And thus this doctrine is likewise excluded as heretical
- HoP 3",64
8336,"Therefore the Church was ruled by Spirit, to enable it to hold to the determinations of the Idea, though always in the historic form
- HoP 3",140
8337,"This is the philosophy of the Fathers; they produced the Church, as the developed Spirit required a developed doctrine, and nothing is so out of place as the endeavour or desire of some men of the present day to lead the Church back to her original form
- HoP 3",261
8338,"The Idea which man, self-consciousness, should recognize, must become altogether objective to him, so that he may truly apprehend himself as spirit and the Spirit, and then that he may be spiritual in a spiritual, and not in an emotional way
- HoP 3",249
8339,"The first objectification is found in the first immediate consciousness of the Idea, where it appeared as an individual object, as the individual existence of a man
- HoP 3",172
8340,"The second objectivity is the spiritual worship and communion extended to the Church
- HoP 3",92
8341,"But this is not supposed to come to pass on earth; that imagination is relegated to heaven, ie to some other place, that is to say, it is put off until death
- HoP 3",165
8342,"Each living actuality directs his feelings, actions, and affairs in a very different way from this
- HoP 3",106
8343,"On the appearance of Christianity it is first of all said: “My kingdom is not of this world;” but the realization has and ought to be in the present world
- HoP 3",162
8344,"In other words the laws, customs, constitutions, and all that belongs to the actuality of spiritual consciousness should be rational
- HoP 3",140
8345,"The kingdom of rational actuality is quite a different one, and must be organized and developed thinkingly and with understanding; the moment of the self-conscious freedom of the individual must maintain its rights against objective truth and objective command
- HoP 3",268
8346,"This, then, is the true and actual objectivity of mind in the form of an actual temporal existence as state, just as Philosophy is the objectivity of thought which comes to us in the form of universality
- HoP 3",211
8347,"Such objectivity cannot be in the beginning, but must come forth after being worked upon by mind and thought
- HoP 3",116
8348,"In Christianity these absolute claims of the intellectual world and of spirit had become the universal consciousness
- HoP 3",124
8349,"Christianity proceeded from Judaism, from self-conscious abjectness and depression
- HoP 3",90
8350,"This feeling of nothingness has from the beginning characterized the Jews; a sense of desolation, an abjectness where no reason was, has possession of their life and consciousness
- HoP 3",187
8352,"This is a second creation which came to pass after the first; in it Mind became aware of itself as I = I, that is, as self-consciousness
- HoP 3",144
8353,"This second creation has first of all appeared in self-consciousness equally directly in the form of a sensuous world, in the form of a sensuous consciousness
- HoP 3",166
8354,"As much of the Notion as has entered in was adopted by the Fathers from the philosophers already mentioned; their Trinity, in so far as a rational thought, and not a mere ordinary conception, comes from these, and certain other ideas also
- HoP 3",246
8355,"But what mainly distinguishes them is the fact that for the Christian this intelligible world had likewise this immediate sensuous truth of an ordinary course of events—a form which it must have and retain for the majority of men
- HoP 3",237
8356,"This new world has therefore, however, to be adopted by a new race of men, by Barbarians; for it is characteristic of barbarians to apprehend the spiritual in a sensuous way
- HoP 3",181
8357,"And it must be by northern barbarians, for it is the northern self-containedness alone that is the immediate principle of this new world-consciousness
- HoP 3",158
8358,"What it had to overcome was on the one hand this sensuous immediacy of its intelligible world, and secondly the opposed sensuous immediacy of actuality, by its consciousness held as null
- HoP 3",194
8359,"It excludes the sun, replaces it with tapers, is furnished with images merely; it is in itself alone, and inward, not reconciled for consciousness—to self-consciousness a sinful, wicked world is present
- HoP 3",210
8360,"For the intelligible world of Philosophy had not yet completed in itself the task of making itself the actual world—of recognizing the intelligible in the actual, as well as the actual in the intelligible
- HoP 3",212
8361,"It is one thing to have the Idea of Philosophy, to recognize absolute essence as absolute essence, and quite another thing to recognize it as the system of the universe, of nature, and of individual self-consciousness, as the whole development of its reality
- HoP 3",266
8362,"The Neo-Platonists had found that principle of realization—namely, this real substance which again places itself in quite opposed, though in themselves real determinations—but having got so far they did not find the form, the principle of self-consciousness
- HoP 3",265
8363,"On the Teutonic nations the world-spirit imposed the task of developing an embryo into the form of the thinking man
- HoP 3",123
8364,"An intelligible world has thus in the conception of men established itself in the mode of this same actuality, like a far-away land that is just as really conceived of by us, peopled and inhabited, as the world we see, but which is hidden from us as though by a mountain
- HoP 3",278
8365,"It is not the Greek or any other world of gods and of mythology—a simple, undivided faith; for there is likewise present in it the highest negativity, that is, the contradiction between actuality and that other world
- HoP 3",224
8366,"This intellectual world expresses the nature of real absolute existence
- HoP 3",79
8367,"It is on it that Philosophy tries its powers, and on it that thought also moils and toils

8369,"Our first view of Philosophy, as revealed in Christianity (pp

8370,"There is no venture too rash for the imagination to undertake, because, impelled by reason, it cannot satisfy itself with beautiful images, but has to pass beyond them
- HoP 3",175
8371,"There is likewise no extravagance of reason into which it does not fall, because it cannot obtain the mastery of the image, but within this element is merely in the act of warfare with it
- HoP 3",195
8372,"Later on than this Western self-immersion, there arose in the East expansion, negation of all that is concrete, abstraction from all determinations; this pure contemplation or pure thought present in Mohammedanism corresponds to the Christian descent into self
- HoP 3",268
8373,"Within Christianity itself, however, the intellectual world is set in opposition to that first Cabalistic principle; in it pure conceptions rule which constitute the ideas present in thought, and with this we enter upon the Scholastic philosophy
- HoP 3",253
8374,"Through the presupposition of the immediately present and accepted truth, thought had lost its freedom and the truth its presence in conceiving consciousness; and philosophy sank into a metaphysics of the understanding and into a formal dialectic
- HoP 3",254
8375,"We have thus in this period first of all to consider philosophy in the East, and secondly in the West; that is, the philosophy of the Arabians first, and subsequently the philosophy of the Schools
- HoP 3",204
8376,"The Schoolmen are the principal figures in this period; they represent European philosophy in the European Middle Ages
- HoP 3",126
8377,"The third stage is the dissolution of what is upheld in the scholastic philosophy; new meteor-like apparitions are now seen, which precede the third period, the genuine revival of free Philosophy

8378,"SECTION ONE  ARABIAN PHILOSOPHY   In the West the Germanic tribes had obtained possession of what had hitherto formed a section of the Roman Empire, and their conquests were attaining to shape and solidity, when another religion dawned in the East, namely the Mohammedan
- HoP 3",278
8379,"The East purified itself of all that was individual and definite, while the West descended into the depths and actual presence of spirit
- HoP 3",144
8381,"Philosophy was fostered and cherished among the Arabians; the philosophy of the Arabians must therefore be mentioned in the history of Philosophy
- HoP 3",153
8382,"What we have to say, however, chiefly concerns the external preservation and propagation of Philosophy
- HoP 3",110
8383,"In Syria, which formed a Greek kingdom, at Antioch, especially in Berytus and Edessa, there were great institutes of learning; and thus the Syrians constituted the connecting link between Greek philosophy and the Arabians
- HoP 3",229
8384,"Syrian was the language of the people even in Bagdad3  Moses Maimonides, a learned Jew, gives further historical particulars in his Doctor Perplexorum of this transition of Philosophy to the Arabians

8386,"They set up principles which served the purpose both of confirming their faith and of refuting the opposite teaching of the philosophers
- HoP 3",144
8387,"The external sequence of events is this
- HoP 3",47
8388,"Syriac versions of Greek works were to be had, and these were now translated into Arabic by the Arabians; or translations were made from the Greek directly into Arabic
- HoP 3",175
8389,"In the reign of Harun al-Raschid several Syrians are named who lived in Bagdad, and who had been called upon by the Caliphs to translate these works into Arabic
- HoP 3",168
8390,"They were the first scientific teachers among the Arabians, and were chiefly physicians; hence the works they translated were on medicine
- HoP 3",145
8391,"Among these translators was Johannes Mesue of Damascus, who lived in the reigns of Al-Raschid (d AD 786), Al-Mamun (d AD 833) and Al-Motawakkil (d AD 847), rather earlier than the rise of the Turks to supremacy (AD 862); he was a hospital superintendent in Bagdad
- HoP 3",271
8392,"Al-Raschid appointed him to make translations from Syriac into Arabic; he opened a public school for the study of medicine and all the sciences then known
- HoP 3",162
8394,"Another is Ebn Adda, an eminent dialectician, who is quoted by Abulfaraj5 Among the works of the Greek philosophers it was almost exclusively the writings of Aristotle which were translated by these Syrians, and the later commentaries on the same
- HoP 3",254
8395,"It was thus not the Arabians themselves who translated the above works
- HoP 3",78
8396,"In the Arabic philosophy, which shows a free, brilliant and profound power of imagination, Philosophy and the sciences took the same bent that they had taken earlier among the Greeks
- HoP 3",190
8399,"A particular description of Arabian philosophy has in some parts but little interest; in other parts it will be found that the main dogmas of this philosophy have much in common with those of the Scholastics
- HoP 3",215
8400,"We may say of the Arabians that their philosophy constitutes no characteristic stage in the development of philosophy
- HoP 3",125
8401,"The principal points in this, as in the later philosophy, were the question whether the world is eternal, and the task of proving the unity of God and similar dogmas
- HoP 3",173
8402,"One great consideration in all this, however, was to defend the doctrines of Mohammedanism, and owing to this all philosophizing had to be carried on within the limits of these doctrines
- HoP 3",194
8403,"But according to all that we know of them, they established no principle of self-conscious reason that was truly higher, and thus they brought Philosophy no further
- HoP 3",172
8404,"They have no other principle than that of revelation, therefore only a principle that is external
- HoP 3",105
8405,"The Medabberim are specially mentioned by Moses Maimonides as a widely extended philosophic school or sect of considerable eminence
- HoP 3",139
8406,"He speaks (More Nevochim, P I c 71, pp
- HoP 3",46
8408,"They insisted on that, and that alone, which concurred with their opinions, even though it were in the most remote degree, through a hundred links of reasoning
- HoP 3",167
8409,"The earliest of their learned men adopted this practice, though professing that they reached these reflections through speculation alone, without reference to any preconceived opinion
- HoP 3",191
8411,"Maimonides says (P I c 71, p 135; c 73, p 149): “The ground-principle of the Medabberim is that men can have no certain knowledge of the nature of things, because in the understanding the contrary may ever exist and be thought
- HoP 3",234
8412,"Besides this they in the majority of instances confound imagination with understanding, and give to the former the name of the latter
- HoP 3",141
8413,"They adopted as a principle, atoms and empty space,” where all connection appears as something contingent
- HoP 3",113
8414,"They have thus in the more advanced cultivation of thought brought to consciousness the main standpoint, then as now the standpoint of the Orientals—that of substance, the one substance
- HoP 3",193
8415,"This pantheism, or Spinozism, if you like to call it so, is thus the universal view of Oriental poets, historians and philosophers
- HoP 3",138
8416,"The Medabberim go on to say: “Substances, ie individuals, which,” for the rest, “are created by God, have many accidental qualities, as in snow every particle is white
- HoP 3",175
8417,"But no quality can endure for two moments; as it comes, it goes again, and God creates another and yet another in its place” All determinations are thus fleeting or perishable; the individual alone is permanent
- HoP 3",218
8418,"But they say that God creates all qualities instantaneously, without natural means and without the help of anything else” General permanence is substance, and the particular is altered every moment, and so exists through the substance
- HoP 3",242
8420,"In the same way knowledge also is an accident, which is created by God at every moment that I know anything; to-day we no longer possess the knowledge which we yesterday possessed
- HoP 3",187
8421,"A man,” when writing, “does not move the pen when he thinks he moves it, but the motion is an accident of the pen, created by God at the moment” In this way God alone is in truth the operative cause; but He might have made everything differently
- HoP 3",253
8422,"The ninth proposition is that accidents have nothing to do with one another; they have no causal connection or other relation; in every substance all accidents may exist
- HoP 3",177
8423,"The tenth proposition is transition (‎‏אִפִשָׁרות‏‎, transitus, possibilitas):” “All that we can fancy may also pass over into the understanding, ie be possible
- HoP 3",168
8424,"But in this way everything is possible,” since there are no laws of the understanding; this transition of thought is thus perfectly accidental
- HoP 3",150
8425,"Everything may just as well be something else as what it is, and there is no reason at all why anything should be one way rather than another
- HoP 3",149
8427,"But at the same time this is certainly also a complete dissolution of all that pertains to reasonableness, in harmony of course with Eastern exaltation of spirit, which allows of nothing definite
- HoP 3",203
8429,"The activity of God is thus represented as perfectly devoid of reason
- HoP 3",77
8430,"This abstract negativity, combined with the permanent unity, is thus a fundamental conception in the Oriental way of looking at things
- HoP 3",142
8431,"Oriental poets are in a marked degree pantheists; the pantheistic is their ordinary point of view
- HoP 3",105
8432,"Thus the Arabians developed the sciences and philosophy, without further defining the concrete Idea; their work is rather the dissolution of all that is definite in this substance, with which is associated mere changeableness as the abstract moment of negativity
- HoP 3",270
8434,"Many of these commentaries are still extant
- HoP 3",51
8435,"The Arabians developed the metaphysics of the understanding and a formal logic
- HoP 3",86
8436,"Some of the famous Arabians lived as early as the eighth and ninth centuries; their progress was therefore very rapid, for the West had as yet made very little advance in culture
- HoP 3",186
8438,"The commentaries on Aristotle and the collections of passages from his writings become thus for the Western world a fountain of philosophy
- HoP 3",146
8439,"For such translations were made from Arabic into Latin by Spanish Arabs, and especially by Jews in the south of Spain and Portugal and in Africa; there was often even a Hebrew translation between
- HoP 3",203
8440,"With the Arabians are closely connected the Jewish philosophers, among whom the above-mentioned Moses Maimonides held a distinguished place
- HoP 3",147
8441,"He was born at Cordova, in Spain, AD 1131 (Anno Mundi 4891, or, according to others, 4895), and lived in Egypt13 Besides More Nevochim, which has been translated into Latin, he composed other works; of him and other Jews much more of a literary character might be said
- HoP 3",276
8442,"In their philosophy a strong Cabalistic element, on the one hand, makes itself felt throughout, in astrology, geomancy, &c; on the other hand, we find in Moses Maimonides, as in the Fathers, that the foundation is laid in history
- HoP 3",237
8443,"He deals with this in a strictly abstract system of metaphysics, which is connected, in Philo’s fashion, with the Mosaic books and their interpretation
- HoP 3",159
8444,"The whole effect of the scholastic philosophy is a monotonous one
- HoP 3",73
8445,"In vain have men hitherto endeavoured to show in this theology, which reigned from the eighth or even sixth century almost to the sixteenth, particular distinctions and stages in development
- HoP 3",198
8447,"It is not interesting by reason of its matter, for we cannot remain at the consideration of this; it is not a philosophy
- HoP 3",128
8448,"The name, however, properly speaking indicates a general manner rather than a system—if we may speak of a philosophic system
- HoP 3",132
8449,"Scholasticism is not a fixed doctrine like Platonism or Scepticism, but a very indefinite name which comprehends the philosophic endeavours of Christendom for the greater part of a thousand years
- HoP 3",203
8451,"The more general acceptance of the Aristotelian writings has merely brought forth a difference of degree and caused no real scientific progress
- HoP 3",151
8452,"Here there is indeed a history of men, but speaking properly none of scientific knowledge; the men are noble, pious, and in all respects most distinguished
- HoP 3",163
8453,"The study of the scholastic philosophy is a difficult one, even if its language only be considered
- HoP 3",106
8454,"The Scholastics certainly make use of a barbaric Latin, but this is not the fault of the Scholastics but of their Latin culture
- HoP 3",135
8456,"It cannot be expected of anyone to know at first hand this philosophy of the Middle Ages, for it is as comprehensive and voluminous as it is barren and ill-expressed
- HoP 3",173
8457,"Of the great schoolmen we still have many works left to us which are very lengthy, so that it is no easy task to study them: the later they are, the more formal do they become
- HoP 3",183
8458,"The Schoolmen did not only write compendiums—for the writings of Duns Scotus amount to twelve, and those of Thomas Aquinas to eighteen folios
- HoP 3",149
8459,"Abstracts of them are to be found in various works
- HoP 3",58
8460,"The principal sources from which we obtain our knowledge are: 1, Lambertus Danæus in the Prolegomena to his Commentarius in librum primum sententiarum Petri Lombardi, Genevæ, 1580
- HoP 3",187
8461,"In Tiedemann’s History of Philosophy extracts from the Scholastics are also to be found, as likewise in Tennemann; Rixner also makes judicious extracts

8466,"In place of the patres ecclesiæ there thus arose later on the doctores
- HoP 3",78
8467,"The scholastic philosophy is thus really theology, and this theology is nothing but philosophy
- HoP 3",102
8469,"All these matters, however, do not pertain to the nature of God and its relation to mankind
- HoP 3",99
8470,"The one essential object of theology as the doctrine of God, is the nature of God, and this content is in its nature really speculative; those theologians who consider this are therefore nothing less than philosophers
- HoP 3",225
8471,"The science of God is nothing but Philosophy
- HoP 3",52
8472,"Philosophy and theology have hence here also been counted one, and it is their separation that constitutes the transition into modern times, seeing that men have thought that for thinking reason something could be true which is not true for theology
- HoP 3",257
8473,"Down to the Middle Ages, on the contrary, it was held as fundamental that there should be but one truth
- HoP 3",111
8474,"Thus the theology of the scholastics is not to be represented as though, as with us, it merely contained doctrines about God, &c, in historic guise, for in fact it also has within it the profoundest speculations of Aristotle and of the Neo-Platonists
- HoP 3",258
8475,"Their philosophy, and much in them that is excellent, is found in Aristotle, only in a simpler and purer form; and to them too the whole lay beyond actuality and mingled with Christian actuality as it is represented to us
- HoP 3",229
8476,"From Christianity, within whose bounds we now have our place, Philosophy has to re-establish its position
- HoP 3",113
8477,"In heathendom the root of knowledge was external nature as thought devoid of self, and subjective nature as the inward self
- HoP 3",131
8478,"Both Nature and the natural self of mankind, and likewise thought, there possessed affirmative significance; hence all this was good
- HoP 3",140
8479,"In Christianity the root of truth has, however, quite another meaning; it was not only the truth as against the heathen gods, but as against Philosophy also, against nature, against the immediate consciousness of man
- HoP 3",224
8480,"Nature is there no longer good, but merely a negative; self-consciousness, the thought of man, his pure self, all this receives a negative position in Christianity
- HoP 3",171
8481,"Nature has no validity, and affords no interest; its universal laws, as the reality under which the individual existences of nature are collected, have likewise no authority: the heavens, the sun, the whole of nature is a corpse
- HoP 3",236
8482,"Nature is given over to the spiritual, and indeed to spiritual subjectivity; thus the course of nature is everywhere broken in upon by miracles
- HoP 3",151
8483,"With this surrender of natural necessity we have the fact associated that all further content, all that truth which constitutes the universal of that nature, is given and revealed
- HoP 3",187
8484,"The one starting-point, the contemplation of nature, is thus for knowledge undoubtedly not present
- HoP 3",106
8485,"Then this fact is likewise set aside that I am present as a self
- HoP 3",72
8486,"The self as this immediate certainty has to be abrogated; it must also merge itself in another self, but in one beyond, and only there does it have its value
- HoP 3",165
8488,"A real sense of self is thus abandoned, but what self-consciousness on the other hand gains is not a universal, a thought
- HoP 3",129
8489,"In thought I have real affirmative significance, not as an individual, but as universal ‘I’; the content of truth is now, however, plainly individualized, and thus the thought of the ‘I’ falls away
- HoP 3",205
8491,"This absolute is itself ‘this’ first of all as this concrete, not as abstraction, but as the unity of universal and individual; this concrete consciousness is for the first time truth
- HoP 3",191
8492,"The reason of the former content being also true, comes to me as something not pertaining to myself, but as a thing received outside of self
- HoP 3",148
8493,"The testimony of spirit, indeed, pertains thereto, and my inmost self is present there; but the testimony of spirit is a thing concealed, which does not further reveal itself, does not beget the content from itself, but receives it
- HoP 3",239
8494,"The Spirit which bears witness is further itself distinguished from me as an individual; my testifying spirit is another, and there only remains to me the empty shell of passivity
- HoP 3",187
8495,"Conditioned by this inflexible standpoint, Philosophy had to go forth once more
- HoP 3",87
8496,"The first working up of this content, the inward operation of universal thought in the same, is the task scholastic philosophy has to undertake
- HoP 3",151
8498,"In this scholastic activity thought pursues its work quite apart from all regard to experience; we no longer hear anything of taking up actuality and determining it through thought
- HoP 3",188
8500,"Still less, in the second place, was the greater part of the content permeated by Notions, for this content was taken up superficially into the form of thought—more especially with the Stoics and Epicureans
- HoP 3",214
8501,"The scholastic philosophy altogether dissociates itself from any such endeavours; it leaves actuality to exist alongside itself as if it were despised and had no interest
- HoP 3",178
8502,"For reason found its true existence, its actualization, in another world and not in this; the whole progress of the cultivated world goes, however, to the re-instalment of a faith in the present world
- HoP 3",208
8503,"Nevertheless, at first all knowledge and action, and whatever relates to an interest in this world, were entirely banished
- HoP 3",130
8505,"Likewise law and right, the recognition of the actual man, were not esteemed as pertaining to the social relationships of life, but to some other sphere
- HoP 3",160
8507,"Now thought as sundered has a content, the intelligible world, as an actuality existent for itself, to which thought applies itself
- HoP 3",139
8510,"Now the scholastic philosophy was here given over to the infinite movement of determinate Notions; the categories of possibility and actuality, freedom and necessity, constitution and substance, &c, are of this nature, they are not fixed, but pure movements
- HoP 3",265
8511,"Anything whatever, determined as potential, transforms itself equally into the opposite, and must necessarily be surrendered; and determination can only save itself by a new distinction, because it must, on the one hand, be given up, and on the other retained
- HoP 3",267
8512,"The scholastics are thus decried on account of the endless distinctions which they draw
- HoP 3",95
8513,"For the sake of these determinations through the abstract Notion the Aristotelian philosophy was predominant, though not in its whole extent
- HoP 3",148
8514,"It was the Aristotelian Organon that was held in such favour, and that indeed just as much for its laws of thought as for its metaphysical conceptions—the categories
- HoP 3",173
8515,"These abstract Notions constituted in their determinateness the understanding of the scholastic philosophy, which could not pass beyond itself and attain to freedom, nor seize upon the freedom given by reason
- HoP 3",216
8516,"From one determination we pass on to another, and such determinations, as particular, are finite; the determination there relates itself externally and not as self-comprehensive and self-embracing
- HoP 3",204
8517,"The result of this determination is that thought will really act as if it brought about conclusions, for to draw conclusions is the mode of formal logical progression
- HoP 3",174
8518,"Philosophy thus consists of a methodical and syllogistic reasoning
- HoP 3",74
8519,"Just as the Sophists of Greece wandered about amongst abstract conceptions on behalf of actuality, so did the scholastics on behalf of their intellectual world
- HoP 3",167
8520,"To the former Being had validity; it they had rescued and delivered as against the negativity of the Notion, while along with that they had justified it through the same
- HoP 3",177
8521,"The principal endeavour of the scholastics was in the same way to vindicate the Christian intellectual world as against the confusion of the Notion, and through the latter to demonstrate its conformity with the same
- HoP 3",223
8522,"The universal form of the scholastic philosophy thus consisted in this—that a proposition was laid down, the objections to it brought forward, and these contradicted through counter-propositions and distinctions
- HoP 3",219
8523,"Philosophy was hence not separated from theology, as it is not in itself, for Philosophy is the knowledge of absolute existence, that is to say, theology
- HoP 3",161
8524,"But to that theology the Christian absolute world was a system which was held to be an actuality, as was ordinary actuality for the Greek sophists
- HoP 3",154
8525,"Of Philosophy proper there thus remained only the laws of thought and abstractions
- HoP 3",90
8526,"Philosophy with the scholastics had consequently the same quality of want of independence as it had before this with the Christian Fathers and the Arabians
- HoP 3",163
8527,"The Church as already constituted established itself amongst the Teutonic nations, and through its constitution it conditioned philosophy
- HoP 3",145
8529,"But the Church in time became dominant, and the Roman emperors, both of the East and of the West, embraced Christianity
- HoP 3",127
8530,"Thus the Church attained to a position openly recognized and undisturbed, from which it exercised much influence upon the world
- HoP 3",135
8531,"The political world, however, fell into the hands of the Teutonic nations, and thereby a new form arose, and to this the scholastic philosophy pertains
- HoP 3",159
8532,"Fresh races inundated the ancient Roman world and established themselves therein; they thus erected their new world on the ruins of the old—a picture which Rome in its present aspect still presents
- HoP 3",205
8533,"There the splendour of the Christian temples is due in part to the remnants of the ancient, and new palaces are built on ruins and have ruins all around
- HoP 3",160
8534,"The principal feature in the Middle Ages is found in this disunion, the two sides here present; there are revealed in it two nations, two manners of speech
- HoP 3",163
8535,"We see people who have hitherto ruled, a previous world having its own language, arts, and sciences, and on this to them foreign element the new nations grafted themselves, and these thus started upon their course internally dissevered
- HoP 3",243
8536,"In this history we have thus before us not the development of a nation from itself, but one proceeding from its opposite, and one which is and remains burdened by this opposite, and which takes it up into itself and has to overcome it
- HoP 3",242
8537,"Hence these people have in this way represented in themselves the nature of the spiritual process
- HoP 3",105
8539,"Hence in the Roman as in the Byzantine world, Christianity has triumphed as a Church; but neither of these worlds was capable of effectuating the new religion in itself and of bringing forth a new world from this principle
- HoP 3",230
8540,"For in both there was a character already present—customs, laws, a juridical system, a constitution (if it can be called constitution), a political condition, capacities, art, science, spiritual culture—in short, everything was there
- HoP 3",241
8541,"The nature of spirit, on the contrary, requires that the world thus constituted should be begotten from it, and that this process of begetting should take place through the agency of reaction, through the assimilation of something which has gone before
- HoP 3",260
8542,"These conquerors have thus established themselves in a foreign sphere, and have become the rulers over it; but at the same time they have come under the dominion of a new spirit which has been imposed upon them
- HoP 3",218
8543,"Although on the one hand predominant, on the other they have come under the dominion of the spiritual element, because they conducted themselves passively in regard to it
- HoP 3",178
8544,"The spiritual Idea or spirituality has become imposed upon the dulness, both in mind and spirit, of these rough barbarians; their hearts were thereby pricked
- HoP 3",165
8545,"The rough nature has in this way become immanent in the Idea as an eternal opposition, or there is kindled in them infinite pain, the most terrible suffering—such that it may even be represented as a crucified Christ
- HoP 3",224
8546,"They had to sustain this conflict within themselves, and one side of it is found in the philosophy which later on made its appearance amongst them, and was first of all received as something given
- HoP 3",204
8547,"They are still uncultured people, but for all their barbaric dulness they are deep in heart and mind; on them, then, has the principle of mind been bestowed, and along with it this pain, this war between spiritual and natural, has necessarily been instituted
- HoP 3",266
8548,"Culture here begins from the most terrible contradiction, and this has to be by it resolved
- HoP 3",99
8549,"It is a kingdom of pain, but of purgatory, for that which is in the pain is spirit and not animal, and spirit does not die, but goes forth from its grave
- HoP 3",161
8550,"The two sides of this contradiction are really thus related to one another in such a way that it is the spiritual which has to reign over the barbarians
- HoP 3",160
8552,"The dominion that exists must take up this position, that spirit is in subjective spirit in harmony with itself
- HoP 3",119
8553,"The universal is thus that opposition in which the one can only have supremacy by the subjection of the other, but which already contains the principle of resolution in itself because mind must necessarily bear rule
- HoP 3",223
8554,"And hence the consequent development is only this, that mind as reconciliation attains the mastery
- HoP 3",106
8555,"To this it pertains that not the subjective consciousness, mind and heart alone, but also the worldly rule, laws, institutions, the human life, in so far as these rest in mind, must become rational
- HoP 3",205
8556,"In the Republic of Plato we have met with the idea that the philosophers are those who ought to reign
- HoP 3",109
8557,"Now is the time in which it is said that the spiritual are to govern, but this talk about the spiritual has been made to bear the significance that ecclesiasticism and the ecclesiastics ought to govern
- HoP 3",209
8558,"The spiritual is thus made a particular form, an individual, but the real meaning that it bears is that the spiritual as such ought to be the determining factor; and this has passed current until the present day
- HoP 3",219
8561,"The divine and spiritual is thus implanted in my subjective spirit, is identical with me; I myself am the universal, and it has efficacy for me only as I directly know it
- HoP 3",178
8562,"This form of reconciliation is the newest, but the most one-sided
- HoP 3",73
8563,"For the spiritual is not there determined as objective, but is only comprehended as it is in my subjectivity, in my consciousness: my conviction as such is taken as ultimate, and that is the formal reconciliation of subjectivity with itself
- HoP 3",248
8564,"If the reconciliation has this form, the point of view of which we spoke before has no longer any interest; it is past and a mere matter of history
- HoP 3",155
8565,"If the conviction as it immediately reveals itself within every subject is the true, the absolute, this process of mediation between God, as the true and absolute, and mankind, is no longer in us a necessity
- HoP 3",215
8566,"The doctrines of the Christian religion have likewise the position of something foreign, pertaining to a particular time, that with which certain men have occupied themselves
- HoP 3",182
8567,"The conception that the Idea is absolutely concrete, and is as spirit in a relation of opposition to the subject, has disappeared, and only shows itself as having passed away
- HoP 3",182
8569,"We have now to consider further the character of the opposition to any agreement with Philosophy; and to do this we must shortly call to mind the historical aspect of the case, although we need only treat of the main points therein
- HoP 3",239
8570,"The first matter to consider is the opposition that exists in the world
- HoP 3",79
8571,"This form of opposition as it appears in history is as follows
- HoP 3",70
8572,"Spirituality as such should be the spirituality of the heart; spirit, however, is one, and thus the communion of those who have this spirituality is asserted
- HoP 3",165
8573,"Hence a community arises, which then becomes an external order, and thus, as we have seen (pp
- HoP 3",101
8574,"In as far as spirit is its principle, it is, as spiritual, immediately universal, for isolation in feeling, opinion, &c, is unspiritual
- HoP 3",143
8575,"The Church organizes itself, but yet it goes forth into worldly existence, attains to riches, possesses goods, and even becomes worldly and imbued with all the brute passions; for the spiritual is merely the original principle
- HoP 3",234
8576,"The heart that is set on ordinary existence, on the world, and the whole of such human relationships as are hereby involved, is guided by these inclinations, desires and passions, by all this grossness and vulgarity
- HoP 3",223
8577,"Thus the Church merely has the spiritual principle within itself without its being truly real, and in such a way that its further relationships are not yet rational; for such is their character before the development of the spiritual principle in the world
- HoP 3",264
8578,"The worldly element without being conformable to the spiritual, is present as existence, and is the immediately natural worldly element; in this way the Church comes to have in itself the immediately natural principle
- HoP 3",225
8579,"All the passions it has within itself—arrogance, avarice, violence, deceit, rapacity, murder, envy, hatred—all these sins of barbarism are present in it, and indeed they belong to its scheme of government
- HoP 3",212
8580,"This government is thus already a rule of passion, although it professes to be a spiritual rule, and thus the Church is for the most part wrong in its worldly principles, though right in its spiritual aspect
- HoP 3",215
8581,"Hence the new religion separated our whole conception of the world into two different worlds, the intellectual but not subjectively conceived world, and the temporal world
- HoP 3",179
8582,"Therefore life as a whole fell into two parts, two kingdoms
- HoP 3",67
8583,"Directly opposite the spiritual worldly kingdom there stands the independent worldly kingdom, emperor against pope, papacy and Church—not a state, but a worldly government; there the world beyond, here the world beside us
- HoP 3",229
8584,"Two absolutely essential principles conflict with one another; the rude ways of the world, the ruggedness of the individual will, beget an opposition most terrible and severe
- HoP 3",182
8585,"The culture which now begins to show itself is confronted by this incomplete reality, as an actual world in opposition to its world of thought; and it does not recognize the one as present in the other
- HoP 3",209
8586,"It possesses two establishments, two standards of measure and of weight, and these it does not bring together but leaves mutually estranged
- HoP 3",147
8588,"The worldly kingdom must thus be subject to the spiritual become worldly; the emperor is hence defender and protector of the Church (advocatus ecclesiæ)
- HoP 3",160
8589,"The worldly element, in a certain sense, takes up a position of independence, no doubt, but it is still in unity with the other in such a way that it recognizes the spiritual as dominant
- HoP 3",194
8590,"In this opposition a war must arise both on account of the worldly element which is present in the Church itself, and likewise on account of the directly worldly element of violence and of barbarism in worldly rule as it exists per se
- HoP 3",242
8591,"The war must at first, however, prove disastrous to the worldly side, for just as its own position is asserted, the other is likewise recognized by it, and it is forced humbly to submit to this last, to the spiritual and its passions
- HoP 3",241
8593,"In the second place, as regards morality in the individual, we see on the one hand religion in its truly noble and attractive form in a few isolated individuals alone
- HoP 3",174
8594,"I refer to those solitary spirits who are dead to the world and far removed therefrom, who find in their emotions what satisfies them, and, living in a little circle, can limit themselves to the sphere of religion
- HoP 3",221
8595,"This is the case with women in the Middle Ages, or with the monks or other solitaries who were able to preserve themselves in a restricted and contracted state of fervour such as this, in which the spiritual side makes itself infinitely felt, although it lacks actuality
- HoP 3",278
8596,"The one truth stood isolated and alone in man, the whole actuality of mind was not yet penetrated by it
- HoP 3",111
8598,"This circle in which mind is realized—the human life—is, however, at first separated from the spiritual region of truth
- HoP 3",127
8600,"All that pertains to actuality is hence not perfected by the truth, which remains a heavenly truth alone, a Beyond
- HoP 3",122
8601,"Actuality, the earthly element, is consequently God-forsaken and hence arbitrary; a few isolated individuals are holy, and the others are not holy
- HoP 3",154
8602,"In these others we first see the holiness of a moment in the quarter of an hour of worship, and then for weeks a life of rudest selfishness and violence and the most ruthless passion
- HoP 3",190
8603,"Individuals fall from one extreme into another, from the extreme of rude excess, lawlessness, barbarism, and self-will, into the renunciation of all things without exception, the conquest of all desires
- HoP 3",210
8604,"The great army of the Crusaders gives us the best example of this
- HoP 3",73
8605,"They march forth on a holy errand, but on the way they give free vent to all the passions, and in this the leaders show the example; the individuals allow themselves to fall into violence and heinous sin
- HoP 3",211
8607,"But this is only a moment which follows upon months of frenzy, foolishness and grossness, which everywhere displayed itself on their march
- HoP 3",146
8608,"Animated by the loftiest bravery, they go on to storm and conquer the sacred citadel, and then they bathe themselves in blood, revel in endless cruelties, and rage with a brutal ferocity
- HoP 3",194
8610,"This comes to pass because the principle is only present in them in its implicitude as an abstract principle, and the actuality of man is not as yet spiritually formed and fashioned
- HoP 3",189
8611,"This is the manner in which the opposition in actuality manifests itself
- HoP 3",80
8612,"In the third place, we reach the opposition existing in the content of religion, in the religious consciousness; this has many forms, though we have here only to call to mind those that are most inward
- HoP 3",209
8613,"On the one hand, we have the Idea of God—that He is known as the Trinity; on the other, we have worship, ie the process of individuals making themselves conformable to spirit, to God, and reaching the certainty of entering the kingdom of God
- HoP 3",249
8614,"A present and actual church is an actuality of the kingdom of God upon earth, in such a way that this last is present for every man—every individual lives and must live in the kingdom of God
- HoP 3",198
8615,"In this disposition we have the reconciliation of every individual; thereby each becomes a citizen of this kingdom, and participates in the enjoyment of this certainty
- HoP 3",175
8616,"But this reconciliation is allied to the fact that in Christ the unity of the divine and human nature is shown forth, that is to say, the way in which the spirit of God must be present in man
- HoP 3",199
8617,"This Christ thus cannot be one who is past and gone, and the life of reconciliation cannot be a mere recollection of that past
- HoP 3",134
8618,"For as the just behold Christ in heaven, so must Christ be an object on earth which may likewise be beheld
- HoP 3",114
8620,"The mediating element to which the individual relates himself in worship, is ever present in the mass as the objective of which the individual must be made to partake, as the Host and the act of partaking of the same
- HoP 3",224
8621,"This Host, on the one hand, as objective, is held to be divine, and, on the other, it is in form an unspiritual and external thing
- HoP 3",138
8622,"But that is the lowest depth of externality reached in the Church; for in this perfect externality it is before the thing that the knee must be bowed, and not in as far as it is an object that may be partaken of
- HoP 3",219
8624,"But in the Church of the Middle Ages, in the Catholic Church generally, the Host is honoured even as an external thing; thus if a mouse eats of the Host, both it and its excrements are reverenced; there the divine element has altogether the form of externality
- HoP 3",268
8625,"This is the central point of intense opposition which is on the one hand dissolved, and on the other remains in perfect contradiction, so that the Host, still held to be a merely external thing, must nevertheless be thus high and absolute
- HoP 3",246
8626,"With this externality the other side is connected—the consciousness of this relation—and here we then have the consciousness of what is spiritual, of what is the truth, in the possession of a priesthood
- HoP 3",210
8627,"Thus as thing it is naturally also in the possession of another, from whom, since it is something distinguished by itself, it has to receive its distinction—or it must be consecrated—and this last is likewise an external action only, performed by individuals
- HoP 3",266
8628,"The power to give this distinction to the thing is in the possession of the Church; from the Church the laity receive it
- HoP 3",128
8629,"But besides all this, the relationship of the subject in himself, the fact that he belongs to the Church and is a true member of the same, must be considered
- HoP 3",165
8630,"After the admission of individuals into the Church their participation therein must likewise be brought about—that is, their purification from sin
- HoP 3",154
8631,"To this it is, however, essential, in the first place, that it should be known what evil is, and secondly, that the individual should desire the good and that pertaining to religion; and thirdly, that sin should be committed from an innate and natural sinfulness
- HoP 3",270
8633,"Against this sinfulness positive commands and laws are now given, so that from the nature of spirit men cannot know what is good and evil
- HoP 3",145
8637,"These are the main facts as regards externality in religion itself, on which all further determinations depend
- HoP 3",118
8638,"We have now obtained a better idea of the elements present in this philosophy; but in barbaric nations Christianity could have this form of externality alone, and this pertains to history
- HoP 3",195
8639,"For the dulness and frightful barbarism of such nations must be met by servitude, and through this service must their education be accomplished
- HoP 3",151
8640,"Man serves under this yoke; this fearful discipline had to be gone through if the Teutonic nations were to be raised into spiritual life
- HoP 3",144
8641,"But this severe and wearisome service has an end, an object; infinite spring and infinite elasticity, the freedom of spirit, is the prize
- HoP 3",145
8642,"The Indians are in equal servitude, but they are irrevocably lost—identified and identical with nature, yet in themselves opposed to nature
- HoP 3",147
8643,"Knowledge is thus limited to the Church, but in this very knowledge a positive authority is firmly rooted, and it is a prominent feature of this philosophy, whose first quality is consequently that of lack of freedom
- HoP 3",224
8645,"In theological form it may be said that, in general, the Middle Ages signify the dominion of the Son and not of Spirit; for this last is still in the possession of the priesthood
- HoP 3",186
8646,"The Son has differentiated Himself from the Father, and is regarded as remaining in this differentiation, so that the Father in Him is only implicit; but in the unity of both we first reach Spirit, the Son as Love
- HoP 3",221
8647,"If we remain a moment too long in the difference without likewise asserting the identity, the Son is the Other; and in this we find the Middle Ages defined and characterized
- HoP 3",181
8648,"The character of Philosophy in the Middle Ages is thus in the second place an attempt to think, to conceive, to philosophize under the burden of absolute hypotheses; for it is not the thinking Idea in its freedom, but set forth in the form of an externality
- HoP 3",265
8649,"We thus find here in Philosophy the same character as is present in the general condition of things, and for this reason I before called to mind the concrete character that prevails; for on every period of time one special characteristic is always imprinted
- HoP 3",265
8650,"The philosophy of the Middle Ages thus contains the Christian principle, which is the highest incentive to thought, because the Ideas therein present are thoroughly speculative
- HoP 3",184
8651,"Of this one side is that the Idea is grasped by the heart, if we call the individual man the heart
- HoP 3",106
8652,"The identity of the immediate individuality with the Idea rests in this, that the Son, the mediator, is known as this man; this is the identity of spirit with God for the heart as such
- HoP 3",192
8653,"But the connection itself, since it is likewise a connection with God in God, is hence immediately mystical and speculative; thus here there is the call to thought which was first of all responded to by the Fathers, and then by the scholastics
- HoP 3",251
8655,"Formal thought directs its course by this; the wanderings of abstract reflection have in such consciousness an aim, which sets a limit upon them, and leads them back to a human concrete
- HoP 3",193
8657,"In this respect the content likewise is unspiritual, and these unspiritual relationships are inverted and carried into the spiritual in so far as advance is made to determinateness of a higher kind
- HoP 3",205
8658,"These three points constitute the main characteristics of this philosophy
- HoP 3",81
8659,"More particularly we would shortly deal with the chief representatives of this philosophy
- HoP 3",97
8660,"Scholastic philosophy is considered to begin with John Scotus Erigena who flourished about the year 860, and who must not be confused with the Duns Scotus of a later date
- HoP 3",178
8661,"With him true philosophy first begins, and his philosophy in the main coincides with the idealism of the Neo-Platonists
- HoP 3",127
8662,"Here and there stray works of Aristotle were likewise known, even to John Scotus, but the knowledge of Greek was very limited and rare
- HoP 3",142
8663,"He shows some knowledge of the Greek and Hebrew tongues, and even of Arabic as well; but we do not know how he attained to this
- HoP 3",135
8664,"He also translated from Greek to Latin writings of Dionysius the Areopagite, a later Greek philosopher of the Alexandrian school, who more especially followed Proclus: namely, De cœlesti hierarchia, and others which Brucker calls (Hist
- HoP 3",243
8665,"Michael Balbus, Emperor of Constantinople, had in the year 824 made a present of these works to the Emperor Louis the Pious; Charles the Bald caused them to be translated by Scotus, who long resided at his court
- HoP 3",219
8667,"Scotus Erigena sets to work philosophically, expressing himself in the manner of the Neo-Platonists, and not freely, and as from himself
- HoP 3",144
8668,"Thus in the method of expression adopted by Plato, and also by Aristotle, we are rejoiced to find a new conception, and on bringing it to the test of philosophy, to find it both correct and profound; but here everything is ready to hand, cut and dry
- HoP 3",257
8669,"Yet, with Scotus, theology is not yet built on exegesis, and on the authority of the Church; the Church in many cases rejected his writings
- HoP 3",147
8672,"Scotus then made a beginning, but properly he does not belong to the scholastics
- HoP 3",88
8674,"The most important and most interesting thoughts which pertain to the scholastics, are, on the one hand, the strife between nominalism and realism; and, on the other, the proof of the existence of God—quite a new manifestation
- HoP 3",234
8675,"The efforts of the scholastics were further directed, firstly, to the building up of the dogmas of the Christian Church on metaphysical bases
- HoP 3",149
8676,"After this, the collected doctrines of the Church were systematically treated
- HoP 3",85
8677,"Then the scholastics had branches or modifications of these dogmas, which were not determined by the doctrinal system
- HoP 3",125
8678,"Those grounds themselves, and then these further and special points of view, were objects handed over for free discussion
- HoP 3",129
8679,"Neo-Platonic philosophy was what lay before the theologians first of all; the manner of this school is recognized in the older and purer scholastics
- HoP 3",156
8680,"Anselm and Abelard are the more distinguished of those who follow later
- HoP 3",79
8681,"Amongst those who wished to give additional proof of the doctrines of the Church through thought, is Anselm, a man of great distinction and high repute
- HoP 3",159
8684,"Those others must be shown through reason how irrationally they strive against us
- HoP 3",89
8685,"The Christian must go on through faith to reason, and not come from reason to faith; but if he cannot attain to comprehension, he must still less depart from faith
- HoP 3",171
8686,"But Anselm and the scholastics maintained the opposite view
- HoP 3",67
8687,"Anselm may be regarded from this point of view as quite specially the founder of scholastic theology
- HoP 3",108
8688,"For the thought of proving through a simple chain of reasoning what was believed—that God exists—left him no rest day and night, and tortured him for long
- HoP 3",162
8690,"This proof was included among the various proofs up to the time of Kant, and—by some who have not yet reached the Kantian standpoint—it is so included even to the present day
- HoP 3",182
8691,"It is different from what we find and read of amongst the ancients
- HoP 3",74
8692,"For it was said that God is absolute thought as objective; for because things in the world are contingent, they are not the truth in and for itself—but this is found in the infinite
- HoP 3",189
8693,"The scholastics also knew well from the Aristotelian philosophy the metaphysical proposition that potentiality is nothing by itself, but is clearly one with actuality
- HoP 3",174
8694,"Later, on the other hand, the opposition between thought itself and Being began to appear with Anselm
- HoP 3",109
8696,"But we reach our profoundest depths in bringing the highest opposition into consciousness
- HoP 3",97
8697,"Only no advance was made beyond the division as such, although Anselm also tried to find the connection between the sides
- HoP 3",129
8698,"But while hitherto God appeared as the absolute existent, and the universal was attributed to Him as predicate, an opposite order begins with Anselm—Being becomes predicate, and the absolute Idea is first of all established as the subject, but the subject of thought
- HoP 3",274
8699,"Thus if the existence of God is once abandoned as the first hypothesis, and established as a result of thought, self-consciousness is on the way to turn back within itself
- HoP 3",179
8700,"Then we have the question coming in, Does God exist?
- HoP 3",60
8702,"The drift of this reasoning is, according to Anselm (Proslogium, c 2), as follows: “It is one thing to say that a thing is in the understanding, and quite another to perceive that it exists
- HoP 3",197
8703,"Even an ignorant person (insipiens) will thus be quite convinced that in thought there is something beyond which nothing greater can be thought; for when he hears this he understands it, and everything that is understood is in the understanding
- HoP 3",252
8704,"But that beyond which nothing greater can be thought cannot certainly be in the understanding alone
- HoP 3",107
8705,"For if it is accepted as in thought alone, we may go on farther to accept it as existent; that, however, is something greater” than what is merely thought
- HoP 3",162
8706,"But that is truly impossible; there thus without doubt exists both in the understanding and in reality something beyond which nothing greater can be thought” The highest conception cannot be in the understanding alone; it is essential that it should exist
- HoP 3",263
8707,"Thus it is made clear that Being is in a superficial way subsumed under the universal of reality, that to this extent Being does not enter into opposition with the Notion
- HoP 3",178
8708,"That is quite right; only the transition is not demonstrated—that the subjective understanding abrogates itself
- HoP 3",119
8709,"This, however, is just the question which gives the whole interest to the matter
- HoP 3",88
8710,"When reality or completion is expressed in such a way that it is not yet posited as existent, it is something thought, and rather opposed to Being than that this is subsumed under it
- HoP 3",190
8711,"This mode of arguing held good until the time of Kant; and we see in it the endeavour to apprehend the doctrine of the Church through reason
- HoP 3",148
8712,"This opposition between Being and thought is the starting point in philosophy, the absolute that contains the two opposites within itself—a conception, according to Spinoza, which involves its existence likewise
- HoP 3",219
8713,"Of Anselm it is however to be remarked that the formal logical mode of the understanding, the process of scholastic reasoning is to be found in him, the content indeed is right, but the form faulty
- HoP 3",205
8714,"For in the first place the expression “the thought of a Highest” is assumed as the prius
- HoP 3",96
8715,"Secondly, there are two sorts of objects of thought—one that is and another that is not; the object that is only thought and does not exist, is as imperfect as that which only is without being thought
- HoP 3",208
8716,"The third point is that what is highest must likewise exist
- HoP 3",67
8717,"But what is highest, the standard to which all else must conform, must be no mere hypothesis, as we find it represented in the conception of a highest acme of perfection, as a content which is thought and likewise is
- HoP 3",224
8719,"In this it is involved that we should first of all have subjective thought, and then distinguished from that, Being
- HoP 3",123
8720,"The assertion “Something that is thought does not exist” is now subsumed under the above standard and is not conformable to it
- HoP 3",134
8721,"But of this opposition nothing here is said
- HoP 3",51
8722,"Undoubtedly God would be imperfect, if He were merely thought and did not also have the determination of Being
- HoP 3",118
8723,"But in relation to God we must not take thought as merely subjective; thought here signifies the absolute, pure thought, and thus we must ascribe to Him the quality of Being
- HoP 3",181
8724,"On the other hand if God were merely Being, if He were not conscious of Himself as self-consciousness, He would not be Spirit, a thought that thinks itself
- HoP 3",163
8725,"Kant, on the other hand, attacked and rejected Anselm’s proof—which rejection the whole world afterwards followed up—on the ground of its being an assumption that the unity of Being and thought is the highest perfection
- HoP 3",227
8727,"That is certainly true: what is only a conception does not exist, but it is likewise not a true content, for what does not exist, is merely an untrue conception
- HoP 3",168
8728,"Of such we do not however here speak, but of pure thought; it is nothing new to say they are different—Anselm knew this just as well as we do
- HoP 3",149
8729,"God is the infinite, just as body and soul, Being and thought are eternally united; this is the speculative, true definition of God
- HoP 3",139
8730,"To the proof which Kant criticizes in a manner which it is the fashion to follow now-a-days, there is thus lacking only the perception of the unity of thought and of existence in the infinite; and this alone must form the commencement
- HoP 3",242
8731,"Other proofs such, for example, as the cosmological, which argues from the contingency of the world to an absolute existence, have thereby not reached the idea of absolute essence as spirit, and are without consciousness of the fact that it is an object of thought
- HoP 3",272
8733,"And then what sort of an understanding is God?
- HoP 3",54
8734,"A different and immediate one; then this spirit is independent
- HoP 3",70
8735,"Further, disorder likewise exists, and thus there must be something else conceived of than this apparent order of nature only
- HoP 3",133
8737,"Here, where we see this form first emerge, absolute existence is clearly to be taken as the Beyond of finite consciousness; this is to itself the null and void, and it has not yet grasped its sense of self
- HoP 3",213
8738,"Its thoughts regarding things are manifold, and the mere fact of being a thing is to it likewise just such a predicate as the rest; but it is thereby not yet turned back within itself, it knows of existence, but not of itself
- HoP 3",233
8739,"In this, says Tennemann (Vol
- HoP 3",36
8740,"I p 121), “Anselm has laid the first formal ground of scholastic theology;” but even before this the same was present, only to a more limited extent, and merely for individual dogmas—as is also the case with Anselm
- HoP 3",222
8741,"His writings bear witness of great penetration and mental ability; and he gave rise to the philosophy of the scholastics, inasmuch as he united theology to philosophy
- HoP 3",174
8742,"The theology of the Middle Ages thus stands much higher than that of modern times; never have Catholics been such barbarians as to say that there should not be knowledge of the eternal truth, and that it should not be philosophically comprehended
- HoP 3",254
8743,"This is one point which has to be specially noted in Anselm, the other is that he apprehended in its unity that highest opposition between thought and Being spoken of above
- HoP 3",180
8744,"With Anselm Peter Abelard is associated, both being mainly concerned in the introduction of philosophy into theology
- HoP 3",124
8746,"He taught at Paris
- HoP 3",26
8747,"Paris about this time was to the theologians what Bologna was to the jurists, the central point of the sciences; it was at that time the seat of philosophizing theology
- HoP 3",176
8748,"Abelard often delivered his lectures there before a thousand listeners
- HoP 3",78
8749,"Theological science and philosophizing regarding it, was in France (as was jurisprudence in Italy) a matter of great importance, which, as most significant in the development of France, has hitherto been too much neglected
- HoP 3",230
8750,"The conception prevailed that philosophy and religion were one and the same; which they absolutely speaking are
- HoP 3",119
8751,"But the distinction was soon reached, “that much may be true in philosophy and false in theology:” this the Church denied
- HoP 3",129
8753,"Peter of Novara in Lombardy was the first of those who brought this to pass; he dates from the middle of the twelfth century, and was the originator of this method
- HoP 3",171
8754,"He died in the year 1164
- HoP 3",32
8755,"Petrus Lombardus set forth a whole system of scholastic theology which remained for several centuries the basis of the doctrine of the Church
- HoP 3",149
8756,"He composed to that end his Quatuor libros sententiarum, and hence he likewise received the name Magister sententiarum
- HoP 3",126
8758,"He himself, indeed, answered these questions, but he caused counter-arguments to follow, and his answer often left the whole matter problematical, so that the questions were not properly decided
- HoP 3",202
8759,"The arguments are thus enumerated on either side; even the Fathers contradicted themselves, and numerous passages from them were quoted by both the opposed sides in support of their respective views
- HoP 3",206
8760,"In this way theses arose, then quæstiones, in reply to these argumenta, then again positiones, and finally dubia; according as men chose to take the words in this sense or that, and followed this or that authority
- HoP 3",221
8761,"Yet a certain degree of method began to enter in
- HoP 3",56
8762,"Speaking generally, this middle of the twelfth century forms the epoch in which scholasticism became more universal as a learned theology
- HoP 3",145
8763,"The book of Lombard was all through the Middle Ages commentated by the doctores theologicæ dogmaticæ, who were now held to be the recognized guardians of ecclesiastical doctrine, while the clergy had charge of the soul
- HoP 3",226
8764,"Those doctors had great authority, they held synods, criticized and condemned this or that doctrine and book as heretical, &c, in synods or as the Sorbonne, a society of such doctors in the University of Paris
- HoP 3",217
8765,"They took the place of assemblages of the Church, and were something like the Fathers in reference to the Christian doctrine
- HoP 3",132
8766,"In particular they rejected the writings of the mystics like Amalrich and his disciple David of Dinant, who, resembling Proclus in their point of view, went back to unity
- HoP 3",178
8768,"The other individual who was equally famous with Peter Lombard, was Thomas Aquinas, born in 1224 of the noble race Aquino, in his paternal castle Roccasicca, in the province of Naples
- HoP 3",191
8769,"He entered the Order of Dominicans, and died in 1274 on a journey to a church council at Lyons
- HoP 3",102
8770,"He possessed a very extensive knowledge of theology, and also of Aristotle; he was likewise called Doctor angelicus and communis, a second Augustine
- HoP 3",156
8772,"Thomas Aquinas likewise added questions, answers and doubts, and he gave the point on which the solution depended
- HoP 3",121
8773,"The main business of scholastic theology consisted in working out the summa of Thomas
- HoP 3",93
8774,"The principal point was to make theology philosophic and more widely systematic; Peter Lombard and Thomas Aquinas are best known in respect of this endeavour, and for long their works formed the basis of all further learned elaborations of doctrine
- HoP 3",256
8775,"With Thomas, Aristotelian forms constitute the basis—that of substance (forma substantialis) is, for instance, analogous to the entelechy (ἐνέργεια) of Aristotle
- HoP 3",169
8776,"In respect of the formal development of philosophic theology a third individual is famous, namely, Duns Scotus, Doctor subtilis, a Franciscan, who was born at Dunston in the county of Northumberland, and who little by little obtained thirty thousand disciples
- HoP 3",267
8777,"In the year 1304 he came to Paris, and in 1308 to Cologne, as a doctor in the university newly instituted there
- HoP 3",119
8778,"He was received with great rejoicings, but he died there of apoplexy soon after his arrival, and is said to have been buried alive
- HoP 3",138
8780,"He was accorded the most excessive praise
- HoP 3",49
8782,"Because he also refuted his arguments in a similar series, everything fell once more asunder; hence he was held to be the originator of the quodlibetan method
- HoP 3",166
8784,"The Latin of Scotus is exceedingly barbarous, but well suited for exact philosophic expression; he invented an endless number of new propositions, terms and syntheses
- HoP 3",174
8785,"These now became much used by them, and were made the subject of further commentaries and discussions
- HoP 3",109
8786,"The veneration, admiration and respect which Aristotle received, now reached its height
- HoP 3",95
8787,"The familiar acquaintance with Aristotle and the Arabians became first evident in Alexander of Hales (died 1245), the Doctor irrefragabilis
- HoP 3",147
8788,"The earlier stages by which this familiarity came about has been shown above (p 35)
- HoP 3",91
8789,"Hitherto the acquaintance with Aristotle was very slight, and through many centuries it was limited, as we saw above (p 37), more especially to his Logic, which had survived from the earliest times and was transmitted in the works of Boethius, Augustine and Cassiodorus
- HoP 3",277
8790,"It was only when we came to Scotus Erigena that we found (p 59) a knowledge of Greek, although it was quite unusual in his day
- HoP 3",134
8791,"In Spain, under the Arabians, the sciences flourished greatly
- HoP 3",69
8792,"Christian doctors there studied medicine under the Jewish-Arabian teachers
- HoP 3",82
8793,"It was principally the Aristotelian metaphysics and physics which were then known, and from these abstracts (summæ) were constructed
- HoP 3",140
8794,"The logic and metaphysics of Aristotle were spun out with extreme fineness into endless distinctions, and brought into genuine syllogistic forms of the understanding, which constituted for the most part the principle for the treatment of the subject dealt with
- HoP 3",268
8795,"In this way dialectic subtlety was much increased, while the properly speculative side in Aristotle remained for the spirit of externality, and consequently also of irrationality, in the background
- HoP 3",205
8796,"At first, indeed, on the first appearance of the Aristotelian writings, the Church made difficulties; the reading of his metaphysics and physics and the abstracts prepared therefrom, as also the exposition of the same, was forbidden by a church synod held at Paris 1209
- HoP 3",277
8798,"Pope Gregory, in a bull issued to the University of Paris in 1231, without mentioning metaphysics, forbade the books of the Physics to be read until they had been examined and purified from all suspicion of error
- HoP 3",220
8800,"Amongst those who distinguished themselves through their commentaries on Aristotle’s writings, we must specially mention Albertus Magnus, the most celebrated German schoolman, of the noble race of Bollstadt
- HoP 3",214
8801,"Magnus either was his family name, or it was given him on account of his fame
- HoP 3",85
8802,"He was born in 1193 or 1205 at Lauingen on the Danube in Swabia, and began by studying at Padua, where his study is still shown to travellers
- HoP 3",149
8803,"In the year 1221 he became a Dominican friar, and afterwards lived at Cologne as Provincial of his Order in Germany: in 1280 he died
- HoP 3",140
8805,"Hence there is current regarding him an old saying: “Albert changed quickly from an ass into a philosopher, and from a philosopher into an ass” His learning was generally understood to consist largely of magic
- HoP 3",217
8807,"Albert wrote a great deal, and twenty-one folios remain to us of his writings
- HoP 3",85
8808,"He wrote on Dionysius the Areopagite, commentated the Magister sententiarum, was specially conversant with the Arabians and the Rabbis, as he was also well acquainted with the works of Aristotle, although he himself understood neither Greek nor Arabic
- HoP 3",259
8809,"He likewise wrote on the Physics of Aristotle
- HoP 3",53
8810,"There is found in him a remarkable instance of deficient knowledge of the history of Philosophy
- HoP 3",103
8811,"He represents the Stoics as being something like our choir-boys; he says that they were people who made songs (facientes cantilenas), and roamed about in porticoes
- HoP 3",171
8812,"For, as he here remarks in a very learned way, the first philosophers clothed their philosophy in verses, and then sang them in halls and porches, and hence they are called standers in the porch (Stoici)
- HoP 3",211
8813,"Gassendi relates (Vita Epicuri, I c 11, p 51) that Albertus Magnus mentioned as the first Epicureans, Hesiodus, Athalius or Achalius (of whom we know nothing), Cæcina, or, as others call him, Tetinnus, a friend of Cicero, and Isaacus, the Jewish philosopher
- HoP 3",265
8814,"How that is arrived at we do not know at all
- HoP 3",52
8815,"Of the Stoics Albertus, on the contrary, mentions Speusippus, Plato, Socrates and Pythagoras
- HoP 3",100
8816,"These anecdotes give us a picture of the condition of culture in these times
- HoP 3",84
8818,"Speaking generally, this controversy is concerned with the metaphysical opposition between the universal and the individual; it occupies the attention of Scholastic philosophy for several centuries, and reflects great credit upon it
- HoP 3",240
8819,"A distinction is drawn between the earlier and later Nominalists and Realists, but otherwise their history is very obscure; and we know more of the theological aspect of the subject than of this
- HoP 3",202
8820,"The beginning of the controversy dates back to the eleventh century, Roscelinus being the earliest Nominalist
- HoP 3",117
8821,"The famous Abelard, although he professes to be an opponent of Roscelinus, is himself nothing more or less than a Nominalist
- HoP 3",132
8822,"Roscelinus wrote also against the doctrine of the Trinity, and was pronounced guilty of heresy in 1092 at an ecclesiastical council which met at Soissons
- HoP 3",161
8823,"His influence was, however, but small36  The matter in question is the universal as such (universale), or the genus, the essence of things, what in Plato was called the Idea—for instance, Being, humanity, the animal
- HoP 3",223
8824,"The followers of Plato asserted that these universals exist; their existence was individualized, and thus ‘tableness’ was said to be also a real existence (supra, Vol
- HoP 3",174
8828,"The realism of the Scholastics in the same way maintained that the Universal has an independent, absolute existence, for Ideas are not liable to destruction, like natural things, therefore they are immutable and the only true existence
- HoP 3",243
8830,"This is then the matter in question; it is of great interest, and is founded upon a much higher opposition than any the ancients knew of
- HoP 3",144
8831,"Roscelinus made universal conceptions arise only from the necessities of language
- HoP 3",89
8833,"Against these assertions arguments are brought forward by which one can see that the manner in which the Christian world was taken as basis, often became in the highest degree ridiculous
- HoP 3",194
8834,"For instance, Abelard reproaches Roscelinus for having asserted that no thing has parts, that only the words which denote the things are divisible
- HoP 3",154
8836,"Nevertheless, the original question as to whether universal notions have reality, and, if so, to what extent they have it, underwent a great variety of modifications and gradations, just as the opposing parties received very various names
- HoP 3",246
8838,"Neither of these two theories was correct in the manner of passing from the universal to the particular
- HoP 3",111
8839,"There were some, however, among the Schoolmen who grasped the true conception that individuation, the limitation of the universal, and indeed of what is most universal, Being and entity, is a negation
- HoP 3",208
8840,"Others said that the limit is itself something positive, but that it is not one with the universal by union with it, for it rather stands in a metaphysical connection with it, that is, in a connection such as that which binds thought with thought
- HoP 3",254
8843,"In his view indeterminate matter becomes individual through an inward positive addition; the substantial forms of things are their real essence
- HoP 3",151
8845,"The opposition between Idealists and Realists appeared at an early stage, it is true, but it was not until later, after the time of Abelard, that it became the order of the day, and was invested with general interest
- HoP 3",224
8846,"He is greatly celebrated for his skill in handling the weapons of logic; he is keen in discrimination and fertile in devising arguments and counter-arguments
- HoP 3",165
8847,"Occam was a leading champion of Nominalism, which up to this time had found only here and there a defender, like Roscelinus and Abelard; his numerous followers received the name of Occamists and were Franciscans, while the Dominicans retained the name of Thomists
- HoP 3",271
8849,"Henceforth theology was taught under two forms (theologia scholastica secundum utramque partem)
- HoP 3",103
8850,"Owing to the civil wars in France, politics also began gradually to affect the relationship between the orders, and this lent increased importance to the conflict into which jealousy had plunged the rival factions
- HoP 3",221
8851,"In 1322, at a convention of his order, and also on other occasions, Occam and his order defended to the utmost of their power the claims of the different princes, such as the King of France and the Emperor of Germany, Louis of Bavaria, against the pretensions of the Pope
- HoP 3",279
8852,"Among the words of William to the Emperor were these, “Do thou defend me with the sword, and I will defend thee with the pen” Interdicts of the Paris University and Papal bulls were issued against Occam
- HoP 3",210
8853,"The Paris University forbade his doctrines to be taught or his works quoted
- HoP 3",83
8855,"No teacher shall assert that a maxim cannot be thus explained or further defined” Occam was excommunicated in 1328, and died at Munich in 134343  Occam asks in one of his writings (in libr
- HoP 3",196
8857,"Occam refutes this, saying: “Nothing which is one in number can, without being changed or multiplied, be present in several subjects or individuals
- HoP 3",155
8859,"It is something conceived, which, however, has objective reality (esse objectivum) in the soul, while the external thing has this objective reality as an explicitly existent subject (in esse subjectivo)
- HoP 3",210
8860,"This comes to pass in the following manner
- HoP 3",50
8861,"The understanding, which perceives a thing outside the soul, forms the mental image of a similar thing, so that, if it had productive power, it would, like an artist, exhibit it in an absolutely existing subject, as numerically an individual distinct from any preceding
- HoP 3",277
8863,"The universal is the One, but not abstract; it is conceived or thought of as comprehending all things in itself
- HoP 3",119
8864,"With Aristotle the universal was, in a judgment, the predicate of the subject in question; in a syllogism it was the terminus major
- HoP 3",139
8865,"But because the Christian religion is a revelation, God is no longer therein the unapproachable, incommunicable, a hidden mystery: for the various stages of the progression from Him are verily His manifestation, and the Trinity is thus the revealed
- HoP 3",256
8866,"In this way the triads and the One are not distinguished, but these three Persons in the Godhead are themselves God and One, ie One as it is for another, as in itself relative
- HoP 3",183
8867,"The Father, the God of Israel, is this One; the moment of the Son and of the Spirit is the Most High in spiritual and bodily presence, the former in the Church, the latter in Nature
- HoP 3",189
8868,"With the Neo-Platonists the universal is, on the contrary, only the first condition of things which then merely opens out and develops; with Plato and Aristotle it is rather the Whole, the All, the All in One
- HoP 3",216
8869,"Buridan, a Nominalist, inclines to the view of the Determinists that the will is determined by circumstances
- HoP 3",116
8870,"Against him is cited the case of the ass which, being placed between two equal bundles of hay, perforce perished from hunger
- HoP 3",132
8871,"Louis XI, in 1473, confiscated the books of the Nominalists and interdicted the teaching of their doctrines, but in the year 1481 this interdict was removed
- HoP 3",164
8872,"In the theological and philosophical faculty Aristotle is said to have been interpreted and studied, as were also his commentators, Averroës, Albertus Magnus, and Thomas Aquinas44   5
- HoP 3",191
8873,"The study of dialectics was carried to a very great height, but it was quite formal in character; this constitutes the fifth point for consideration
- HoP 3",156
8874,"With this is closely connected the interminable finding out of termini technici
- HoP 3",87
8875,"This formal dialectic was very ingenious in devising objects, problems and questions, destitute of all religious and philosophic interest, on which to practise its method of procedure
- HoP 3",191
8877,"Originally, it is true, the basis was spiritual, but the externality in which it was at once comprehended, made of the spiritual something perfectly unspiritual
- HoP 3",168
8879,"For the dogma of the Church explicitly contains, in the historical form of the Christian religion, a number of ordinary conceptions determined in an external way, which are connected with the spiritual, it is true, but trench upon sensuous relationships
- HoP 3",261
8880,"If a network of such relationships is then contrived, there arises a host of oppositions, contrasts, contradictions, which have not the very slightest interest for us
- HoP 3",174
8881,"It is this aspect of the matter that the Scholastics have taken up and handled with finite dialectic; and it is on this account that the Scholastics in later times were so much ridiculed
- HoP 3",194
8882,"Of this I have some examples to give
- HoP 3",44
8883,"Julian, Archbishop of Toledo, sought, with as great earnestness as if the salvation of the human race depended on it, to answer questions which contain an absurd assumption
- HoP 3",180
8884,"In doing so he no less gives himself up to petty triflings than do the philologists when they institute investigations regarding Greek accents, metres, and verse-divisions
- HoP 3",179
8885,"For instance, there arises a question of this kind as to the dead
- HoP 3",73
8886,"It is a dogma of the Church, that man will rise again; now if to this it be added that he will be clothed with the body, we thereby enter the sensuous sphere
- HoP 3",165
8887,"The following were inquiries which arose in connection with this question: “What will be the age of the dead when they rise?
- HoP 3",132
8888,"Will they rise as children, youths, grown men, or aged?
- HoP 3",63
8889,"In what form will they rise?
- HoP 3",36
8890,"What will be the constitution of their bodies?
- HoP 3",54
8891,"Will the fat be again fat, and the lean again lean?
- HoP 3",59
8892,"Will the distinction of sex continue in that future life?
- HoP 3",65
8893,"Will those who rise again recover all that they lost here in the way of nails and hair?”45 Thus a special distinction was drawn between the actual dogma, which was indisputable, and the various aspects of the supersensuous world which are connected with that dogma
- HoP 3",272
8894,"These were regarded, though often only for the time being, as detached from the doctrinal system of the Church
- HoP 3",118
8895,"For the system was not so definitely formulated but that anything in it might have to be proved from the Fathers, until a council or a special synod decided the point
- HoP 3",174
8897,"The Scholastic Philosophy is thus the direct opposite of the empirical science of the understanding, with which curiosity is largely mingled, and which, careless of the Notion, follows after facts alone
- HoP 3",210
8898,"About 840 another subject of discussion was raised, namely, the birth of Christ, whether it was natural or supernatural
- HoP 3",127
8899,"This led to a protracted controversy
- HoP 3",44
8901,"God’s wisdom, omnipotence, foresight, and predetermination led in the same way to a host of contradictions in abstract, meaningless, local and trivial particulars, which concern not God
- HoP 3",193
8904,"Where the angels were after their creation?
- HoP 3",51
8905,"If the angels have always existed?” A multitude of other questions of this kind are raised regarding the angels
- HoP 3",119
8906,"Then he asks: “At what age was Adam created?
- HoP 3",52
8907,"Why was Eve made from the rib, and not from some other part of the man?
- HoP 3",79
8908,"Why did the first human pair not have intercourse in Paradise?
- HoP 3",70
8909,"How the human race would have been propagated, if man had not sinned?
- HoP 3",77
8910,"If in Paradise children would have been born with limbs fully grown, and the complete use of their senses?
- HoP 3",114
8911,"Why it was the Son, and not the Father or the Holy Ghost, who became man?” To do this rests in the very Notion of the Son
- HoP 3",129
8912,"Is the proposition possible that God the Father hates the Son?
- HoP 3",70
8913,"Might God not have also taken the form of a woman, or have passed into the devil?
- HoP 3",89
8914,"Might He not also have appeared in the form of an ass or of a pumpkin?
- HoP 3",78
8915,"In what manner would the pumpkin have preached and wrought miracles, and how would it have been crucified?”49 Thus were intellectual determinations combined and distinguished in a manner altogether without sense or thought
- HoP 3",230
8916,"The main point is that the Scholastics were like barbarians in their way of handling divine things and bringing them into sensuous determinations and relations
- HoP 3",167
8918,"In such representations as are given in the Bible of the wrath of God, or of the history of God’s work of creation, it is said that God did this or that, naming some human and homely action
- HoP 3",197
8919,"God is certainly not to be looked on as something alien and unapproachable; on the contrary, we are to come to Him with courage and with all our heart
- HoP 3",158
8920,"But to bring Him into the province of thought, and strive in earnest after a knowledge of Him, is a very different matter
- HoP 3",129
8921,"The reverse of this is to bring forward arguments pro and contra, for they decide nothing, and are of no use; they are no more than the assumptions which are only sensuous and finite determinations, and therefore infinite differences and distinctions
- HoP 3",258
8922,"This barbarous use of the understanding is utterly irrational; it is like putting a golden necklace on a sow
- HoP 3",116
8923,"The One is the Idea of the Christian religion, and it is also the philosophy of the great and noble Aristotle; neither of the two could have been more bedraggled and besmirched, to so low a pass had the Christians brought their spiritual Idea
- HoP 3",250
8924,"In the above sketch we have mentioned the principal heads which come under our consideration in studying Scholastic philosophy
- HoP 3",134
8926,"They took but little interest in these discussions and arguments, and maintained their purity in regard to Church doctrines and philosophic speculation
- HoP 3",159
8927,"Some of them were pious and spiritual men, who carried on their philosophic studies upon the lines of the Neo-Platonic philosophy, as Scotus Erigena had done in earlier times
- HoP 3",182
8928,"Among them genuine philosophy is to be found—termed also Mysticism; it tends to inwardness and bears a great resemblance to Spinozism
- HoP 3",141
8929,"They also derived morality and the religious sentiment from actual feelings, and the meditations and maxims we have from them embody these views
- HoP 3",152
8930,"Very similar were the views expressed by Raymundus of Sabunde or Sabeyde, a Spaniard of the fifteenth century, and professor at Toulouse about the year 1437
- HoP 3",164
8931,"In his theologia naturalis, which he handled in a speculative spirit, he dealt with the Nature of things, and with the revelation of God in Nature and in the history of the God-man
- HoP 3",188
8932,"He sought to prove to unbelievers the Being, the trinity, the incarnation, the life, and the revelation of God in Nature, and in the history of the God-man, basing his arguments on Reason
- HoP 3",195
8933,"From the contemplation of Nature he rises to God; and in the same way he reaches morality from observation of man’s inner nature51 This purer and simpler style must be set off against the other, if we are to do justice to the Scholastic theologians in their turn

8934,"Roger Bacon treated more especially of physics, but remained without influence

8935,"Raymundus Lullus, the Doctor illuminatus, made himself famous chiefly by the art of thinking which he invented, which was called the ars magna
- HoP 3",150
8936,"He was born at Majorca in 1234, and was one of those eccentric, unsettled natures whose activity finds vent in all directions
- HoP 3",133
8937,"He had a strong inclination towards alchemy and great enthusiasm for the sciences in general, as well as a fiery, restless power of imagination
- HoP 3",151
8938,"In his youth he led a reckless life, throwing himself headlong into a round of pleasures; then he retreated to a desert, and had there many visions of Jesus
- HoP 3",164
8939,"At this time the impulse shaped itself in his ardent nature to dedicate his life to spreading the blessings of Christianity among the Mohammedans in Asia and Africa
- HoP 3",172
8941,"He lived long in Paris at the beginning of the fourteenth century, and was the author of well-nigh four hundred works

8943,"Lullus is so systematic that he becomes at times mechanical
- HoP 3",67
8944,"He constructed a diagram in circles, on which were marked triangles through which the circles pass
- HoP 3",106
8945,"In these circles he arranged the various concepts, and strove to give a complete catalogue of them
- HoP 3",106
8946,"Some of the circles were fixed, others movable, and they were six in number, two of them indicating the subjects, three the predicates, while the outermost circle represented possible questions
- HoP 3",201
8948,"How and wherewith?
- HoP 3",26
8949,"These circles had to be placed in a certain way, in order to give proper combinations
- HoP 3",93
8950,"After thus dealing with the subject in detail, we must pronounce judgment on the Scholastics, and give an estimate of them
- HoP 3",130
8952,"For although religion is its subject matter, thought here reached such an excessive point of subtlety that, as a form of the mere empty understanding, it does nothing but wander amongst baseless combinations of categories
- HoP 3",229
8953,"Scholastic philosophy is this utter confusion of the barren understanding in the rugged North German nature
- HoP 3",115
8957,"The existence of the Church, as the government of Christ upon earth, is higher, it is true, than the external existence which stands in contrast to it; for religion must rule our temporal affairs, and through the subjection of worldly power the Church became a theocracy
- HoP 3",278
8958,"But the divine kingdom, the dwelling-place of the dead, was to be reached only through the gate of death; yet the natural world was dead to an equal degree—all that lived in it was the vision of that other world, and hope—it had no present

8963,"There is no good, however, in calling the Middle Ages a barbarous period
- HoP 3",80
8964,"It is a singular kind of barbarism, and is not simple and rude; for the absolute Idea and the highest culture have sunk into barbarism, and that through the agency of thought
- HoP 3",182
8965,"Thus we have here, on the one hand, the most hideous form of barbarism and perversion, but, on the other hand, the never-failing source of a higher reconciliation
- HoP 3",170
8966,"If we seek an immediate contrast to scholastic philosophy and theology and their methods, we may say that it is to be found in the “healthy human understanding,” in outward and inward experience, in the contemplation of nature, and in humanity
- HoP 3",251
8967,"The character of Greek humanity, for instance, was that everything concrete, everything that possessed interest for mind, had its place in the human breast, and its root in the feelings and thoughts of man
- HoP 3",213
8969,"Even should we go astray on ground like this, our errors keep in view the fixed centre-point of the self-consciousness of the human mind, and as errors even they have a root therein, which as such forms the justification for them
- HoP 3",237
8970,"It is only a one-sided withdrawal from the unity of this root with the altogether concrete ground-work and original, that is really faulty
- HoP 3",146
8971,"What we see here, in contrast with the above, is the infinite truth, expressed as spirit, committed to a nation of barbarians who have not the self-consciousness of their spiritual humanity—they have a human breast, it is true, but not yet a human spirit
- HoP 3",262
8972,"The absolute truth does not yet make itself real and present in actual consciousness, but men are torn out of themselves
- HoP 3",128
8974,"Thus they can only find rest and reconciliation when they come absolutely out of themselves, and they have become fierce and savage in the very circumstances and by the very means which ought to have rendered their spirit peaceable and mild
- HoP 3",248
8975,"Just as truth was not yet the foundation of reality, so science was likewise destitute of firm basis
- HoP 3",108
8976,"The understanding, when it comes to think, applies itself, it is true, in the first place to the mysteries of religion, which, as an altogether speculative content, exist for the rational Notion only
- HoP 3",207
8978,"This understanding therefore draws its content entirely from things to which it remains altogether alien, and which remain altogether alien to it; yet it is not thereby at all circumscribed, for it observes no bounds in its determinations and distinctions
- HoP 3",263
8980,"In the second place, in so far as the understanding keeps to the given religious content, it can prove this content; one can demonstrate that it must be so, just as if it were a geometrical proposition
- HoP 3",209
8981,"But there still remains something to be desired, in order that the satisfaction may be complete; the content is proved, but I nevertheless do not understand it
- HoP 3",167
8982,"Thus Anselm’s excellent proposition (supra, pp
- HoP 3",54
8983,"Though I see the truth of the proposition, I have not attained to the final point, the object of my desire; for there is lacking the I, the inner bond, as inwardness of thought
- HoP 3",184
8984,"This lies only in the Notion, in the unity of the particular and the universal, of Being and thought
- HoP 3",108
8985,"For the comprehension of this unity, without which there could be no true proof, it was implied that further progress should not take place after the manner of the understanding
- HoP 3",185
8987,"On the other hand it must in like manner be demonstrated in the case of Being that it is its peculiar dialectic to abrogate itself, and from itself to make itself a universal Notion
- HoP 3",189
8988,"The determination of itself into Being is certainly an object of thought, whose content is thought itself
- HoP 3",113
8989,"This is inwardness, not a mere conclusion drawn from presuppositions
- HoP 3",76
8990,"Here in scholastic philosophy, however, the object is not the nature of thought and Being, for what they are is a mere matter of assumption
- HoP 3",147
8991,"The understanding may take its start from experience, a given concrete content, a determinate contemplation of nature, the human heart, right, duty, which are just exactly what inwardness means
- HoP 3",201
8992,"It may find its determinations, so to speak, on behalf of this content, and starting from this point it may come to abstractions, such as matter and force in physics
- HoP 3",173
8993,"In this case, although a general form such as this does not satisfy the content, it has at any rate therein a fixed point, by which it can regulate itself, and a boundary line for speculation, which would otherwise have no limit set to its roaming
- HoP 3",255
8994,"Or when we have the concrete perception of state and family, reasoning has in this content a fixed point which gives it guidance—a conception, which is the main thing; the deficiency in its form becomes concealed and forgotten, and emphasis is not laid on it
- HoP 3",266
8996,"Because there was no standard set up for this scholastic understanding, either by concrete intuition or by the pure Notion, it remained unregulated in its externality
- HoP 3",174
9000,"In so doing, however, they involved themselves in an endless web of distinctions, which could themselves be held in the concrete, and maintained thereby alone
- HoP 3",166
9002,"The Aristotelian philosophy is quite opposed to this Scholastic procedure, but it became therein alienated from itself
- HoP 3",126
9005,"It might be said of the Scholastics that they philosophized without conception, that is, without a concrete; for esse reale, esse formale, esse objectivum, quidditas (τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι) they made their subjects of discussion
- HoP 3",229
9006,"This crude understanding, in the fourth place, made everything equal, reduced it all to the same level, and that in virtue of its abstract universality, which was held to be valid
- HoP 3",187
9007,"In politics also the understanding aims at making all alike equal
- HoP 3",73
9010,"This understanding in its operations furnishes no bridge from the universal to the particular, and the conclusions which it draws it leaves up in the clouds as conceptions of its fancy
- HoP 3",192
9011,"If, for instance, law is divided into canonical law, criminal law, and so on, the ground of division is not taken from the universal itself; and it is thus left vague which particular determination is in accordance with the universal object
- HoP 3",248
9012,"If this object is God,—for instance, such a determination as that He became man—the relation between God and man is not derived from their nature
- HoP 3",153
9013,"Because God only manifests Himself, He can do so in any way whatever; then, because nothing is impossible with God, the pumpkin idea is easily introduced (p 90), since it is a matter of indifference in which determination the Universal is supposed to be
- HoP 3",261
9014,"Regarding the apple in Paradise the understanding asks to what species of apple it belonged
- HoP 3",99
9015,"We must go on to indicate the principles which have been adopted and stand opposed to one other, and the development of the same, in order to comprehend the transition into modern history and the present standpoint of philosophy
- HoP 3",236
9016,"For this reason we must speak of the further progress of universal spirit
- HoP 3",81
9017,"For thought was distorted by reason of its being bound to an externality, and spirit was in it no longer acting for spirit
- HoP 3",130
9018,"Because then in this and similar ways the Idea of spirit had, as it were, its heart pierced through, the parts remained without spirit and life, and were worked upon by the understanding
- HoP 3",194
9019,"Amongst the learned ignorance of the rational was displayed, a complete and unnatural lack of spirituality; and in the same way there was the most utter and terrible ignorance amongst the others, the monks
- HoP 3",213
9020,"This destruction of knowledge brought about the transition to a different state of affairs; while heaven and the divine were thus degraded, the lofty aspirations and high spiritual claims of the clerical element rose above the secular
- HoP 3",242
9021,"For we saw that the supersensuous world of truth, as the world of religious conceptions, was ruined by the understanding making all things equal
- HoP 3",152
9022,"We saw, on the one hand, a handling of dogma in philosophic fashion, but we saw also a development of formal logical thought, the secularization of the absolutely existent content
- HoP 3",187
9023,"In the same way the existing Church, this presence of heaven upon earth, brought itself down to the level of the secular, by entering upon the possession of riches and lands
- HoP 3",181
9024,"In this way the distinction between the world and the Church is blotted out, not in a rational manner as regards the Church, but in a way that is altogether revolting, and which amounts to destruction: it is a reality, I grant, but one most terrible and barbarous
- HoP 3",271
9025,"For state, government, right, property, civil order, all these enter into religion as rational differences, that is, laws on their own account fixed
- HoP 3",156
9026,"The acknowledgment of ranks, classes, divisions, their different occupations, the stages and degrees of evil, as well as of good, are an entering into the form of finitude, actuality, existence of the subjective will, while what is religious has only the form of infinity
- HoP 3",279
9027,"But the Church in its outward existence is inviolable, it can throw over all the laws of the good; every offence against it is a violation of sanctity
- HoP 3",158
9028,"Evil and its penalties are made eternal, divergences of opinion are punished even with death: so are heresy and also heterodoxy in respect of the most abstract and empty determinations of an endless system of dogmas
- HoP 3",223
9029,"Abominable practices and evil passions, utter wantonness, voluptuousness, bribery, dissoluteness, avarice, crimes of all kinds found their way into the Church, because it was unrestrained by laws; and it founded and maintained the system of government
- HoP 3",259
9030,"The secular ought to be only secular; but this whole secular government of the Church claims at the same time the dignity and authority of the divine
- HoP 3",157
9031,"This mingling of the sacred, divine, inviolable, with temporal interests, begets, on the one hand, fanaticism, as among the Turks, and on the other hand, the humility and obedientia passiva of the laity against this dread power
- HoP 3",235
9032,"It was this ruin of the supersensuous world, as represented in knowledge and as the actual Church, that inevitably forced man out of a temple such as this, the Holy of Holies degraded into finitude
- HoP 3",205
9033,"Against this disunion, on the other hand, the secular element has spiritualized itself in itself; or it has established itself firmly in itself, and that in a manner which the Spirit justifies
- HoP 3",200
9034,"To religion was lacking the presence of its culminating point, the present reality of its head; to the present secularity there is lacking the presence in it of thought, reason, spirit
- HoP 3",192
9035,"In the tenth century there was manifested in Christendom a general impulse to build churches, although it was not possible to regard God Himself as present therein
- HoP 3",171
9036,"It was thus that Christianity rose up, in her longing to take to herself the principle of reality as absolutely her own
- HoP 3",127
9037,"But neither these buildings, nor external wealth, nor the power and dominion of the Church, nor monks, nor clergy, nor Pope, are the principle of real actual presence in her; they were insufficient for the spiritual

9038,"The Pope or the Emperor is not Dalai-lama, the Pope is only the Vicar of Christ; Christ, as a past existence, is in memory and hope alone
- HoP 3",145
9039,"Impatient at the lack of reality and at the want of holiness, Christendom goes to seek this true Head; and this is the ruling motive of the Crusades
- HoP 3",156
9040,"Christendom sought Christ’s outward presence in the land of Canaan, the traces of Him, the mount where He suffered, His grave; they took possession of the Holy Sepulchre
- HoP 3",177
9041,"These holy spots, the Mount of Olives, the Jordan, Nazareth, as external sensuous presence of place without presence of time, are things of the past, a mere memory, no perception of the immediate present; the Christians found only their loss, their grave, in this present
- HoP 3",279
9042,"Barbarians all the time, they did not seek the universal, the world-controlling position of Syria and Egypt, this central point of the earth, the free connection of commerce; Bonaparte did this when mankind became rational
- HoP 3",230
9043,"The Crusaders were by the Saracens and by their own violence and repulsiveness, as also by their own misery (p 53), brought to confess that they had in this deceived themselves
- HoP 3",184
9044,"This experience taught them that they must hold to the actual reality which they despised, and seek in this the realization of their intelligible world
- HoP 3",159
9045,"Because their acts, their aims and their interests are upright, and thus are constituted the Universal, the present is rational
- HoP 3",135
9046,"What pertains to the world has thus become fixed in itself, that is, it has received into itself thought, justice, reason
- HoP 3",129
9047,"In the first independence there is contained the moment of barbarism, which has need of fear in order to be held within bounds
- HoP 3",134
9048,"Now, however, we see justice and order enter in; it is true that the ruling order is the feudal system with its servitude, but everything therein has certainly a firm basis in justice
- HoP 3",191
9049,"Justice, however, has its root in freedom, and thus the individual therein brings himself into existence, and is recognized; nevertheless relationships which properly belong to the state are here still made the concern of private individuals
- HoP 3",249
9051,"Even under the feudal system, moreover, justice, civil order, legal freedom gradually emerged
- HoP 3",101
9052,"In Italy and Germany cities obtained their rights as citizen republics, and caused these to be recognized by the temporal and ecclesiastical power; wealth displayed itself in the Netherlands, Florence and the free cities on the Rhine
- HoP 3",241
9053,"In this way men gradually began to emerge from the feudal system; an example of this is seen in the case of the Capitani
- HoP 3",128
9054,"The fact that the lingua volgare became the language used may also be looked on as a springing up of self-abnegation of spirit: as in Dante’s Divina Commedia
- HoP 3",165
9055,"The spirit of the times took this new direction; it forsook the intellectual world, and looked upon its present world, this hither side
- HoP 3",143
9056,"The finite heaven, the content which had lost its religious character, drove it to the finite present
- HoP 3",109
9057,"Since in this way the temporal power, the worldly life, self-consciousness, has taken into itself the higher and more divine ecclesiastical principle, the harsh contrast has disappeared
- HoP 3",193
9058,"The power of the Church appeared as the violence of the Church, not aiming at operating in accordance with reality and in reality, but at being mighty in the spirit
- HoP 3",172
9059,"There at once came into the secular element the consciousness that abstract Notions were filled with the reality of the present, so that this was no longer a nullity, but had truth also in itself
- HoP 3",203
9060,"With this commerce and the arts are associated
- HoP 3",54
9061,"It is implied in the arts that man brings what is divine out of himself; as artists were at one time so pious that as individuals they had self-abnegation as their principle, it was they from whose subjective abilities these representations were produced
- HoP 3",262
9062,"In his handicraft the individual is taken in reference to his work, and is himself the producer
- HoP 3",103
9063,"Thus men came to the point of knowing that they were free, and insisting on the recognition of that freedom, and having the power of exercising their activity for their own objects and interests
- HoP 3",202
9064,"Thus spirit came again to itself; it drew itself together again, and looked into its reason, as if looking into its own hands
- HoP 3",133
9065,"This new birth is pointed out as the revival of the arts and sciences which were concerned with present matter, the epoch when the spirit gains confidence in itself and in its existence, and finds its interest in its present
- HoP 3",232
9066,"It is in reality reconciled with the world, not implicitly, far away in mere thought, at the last day, at the world’s transfiguration, ie when the world is reality no more, but it has to do with the world as not by any means annihilated
- HoP 3",244
9067,"The man who was moved to seek what was moral and right, could no longer find it on such soil, but looked round about him to seek it elsewhere
- HoP 3",149
9068,"The place which was pointed out to him is himself, his inner life, and external Nature; in the contemplation of Nature the spirit begins to have a sense of being present therein

9069,"SECTION THREE  REVIVAL OF THE SCIENCES   The deeper interest of the subject had been lost sight of, as we have seen, in the dryness and dulness of the content of thought, and in speculations which went wandering off into endless details
- HoP 3",244
9070,"But now spirit gathered itself together, and rose to claim the right to find and know itself as actual self-consciousness, both in the supersensuous world and in immediate nature
- HoP 3",186
9071,"This awakening of the self-hood of spirit brought with it the revival of the arts and sciences of the ancient world
- HoP 3",123
9072,"This looked like a falling back into childhood, but it was really a spontaneous ascent into the Idea, a movement originating with self—while up to this time the intellectual world had been rather something given from without
- HoP 3",232
9073,"From this proceeded all efforts and all inventions, the discovery of America and of the way to the East Indies
- HoP 3",118
9074,"Thus in a very special way the love for the old, so-called heathen sciences once more awoke, for men turned to the works of the ancients, which had now become objects of study, as studia humaniora, where man is recognized in what concerns himself and in what he effects
- HoP 3",277
9075,"These sciences, though at first they were placed in opposition to the divine, are rather themselves the divine, as living, however, in the reality of spirit

9076,"Men, because they are men, find it interesting to study men as men
- HoP 3",74
9077,"The idea became prevalent that the understanding can recognize something to be false which the Church affirms to be true; and it was of importance that the understanding did so apprehend itself, although it was in opposition to the positive in general
- HoP 3",259
9078,"The first way in which the desire to find the human element in reference to what pertains to science manifested itself, was that an interest in such matters sprang up in the West, a receptive power where the ancients in their definiteness and beauty are concerned
- HoP 3",271
9080,"Even the Roman laws were brought back from the East, until a code of the corpus juris was by chance discovered

9125,"Though it cannot be denied that there was in them a wonderful insight into what was true and great, there is no doubt on the other hand that they revelled in all manner of corruption in thought and heart as well as in their outer life
- HoP 3",242
9126,"There is thus to be found in them great originality and subjective energy of spirit; at the same time the content is heterogeneous and unequal, and their confusion of mind is great
- HoP 3",188
9127,"Their fate, their lives, their writings—which often fill many volumes—manifest only this restlessness of their being, this tearing asunder, the revolt of their inner being against present existence and the longing to get out of it and reach certainty
- HoP 3",258
9128,"These remarkable individuals really resemble the upheavals, tremblings and eruptions of a volcano which has become worked up in its depths and has brought forth new developments, which as yet are wild and uncontrolled
- HoP 3",225
9129,"The most outstanding men of this nature are Cardanus, Bruno, Vanini, Campanella, and lastly Ramus
- HoP 3",105
9130,"They are representative of the character of the time in this interval of transition, and fall within the period of the Reformation
- HoP 3",138
9131,"Hieronymus Cardanus is of their number; he was remarkable as an individual of world-wide reputation, in whom the upheaval and fermentation of his time manifested itself in its utmost violence
- HoP 3",199
9132,"His writings fill ten folio volumes
- HoP 3",43
9133,"Cardanus was born in 1501 at Pavia, and died at Rome in 1575
- HoP 3",68
9134,"He recounted his own history and described his character in his book De vita propria, where he makes an extraordinary confession of his sins, passing the severest possible judgment upon them
- HoP 3",198
9135,"The following may serve to give a picture of these contradictions
- HoP 3",73
9136,"His life was a series of the most varied misfortunes, external and domestic
- HoP 3",83
9137,"He speaks first of his pre-natal history
- HoP 3",48
9138,"He relates that his mother, when pregnant with him, drank potions in order to produce abortion
- HoP 3",102
9139,"His father was very severe in his treatment of him
- HoP 3",58
9140,"He lived sometimes in the most crushing poverty and the utmost want, sometimes in the greatest luxury
- HoP 3",109
9141,"Afterwards he applied himself to science, became a Doctor of Medicine, and travelled much
- HoP 3",97
9142,"He was celebrated far and wide; summons came to him from every quarter, several times he was called to Scotland
- HoP 3",119
9143,"He writes that he cannot tell the sums of money that were offered to him
- HoP 3",80
9144,"He was professor at Milan, first of mathematics and then of medicine; after that he lay for two years in Bologna in the strictest imprisonment, and had to undergo the most frightful tortures
- HoP 3",198
9146,"He lived his whole life in perpetual inward and outward storms
- HoP 3",70
9147,"He says that he suffered the greatest torments in his soul
- HoP 3",66
9148,"In this inward agony he found the greatest delight in inflicting torture both on himself and others
- HoP 3",107
9149,"He scourged himself, bit his lips, pinched himself violently, distorted his fingers, in order to free himself from the tortures of his spiritual disquietude and induce weeping, which brought him relief
- HoP 3",209
9150,"The same contradictions were to be seen in his outward demeanour, which was sometimes quiet and decorous, while at other times he behaved as if he were crazy and demented, and that without any external provocation whatever, and in matters the most indifferent
- HoP 3",267
9151,"Sometimes he put on decent clothes and made himself neat and trim, at other times he went in rags
- HoP 3",105
9152,"He would be reserved, diligent, persevering in his work, and then would break out into excesses, wasting and squandering all that he had, his household goods and his wife’s jewels
- HoP 3",187
9153,"Sometimes he would walk quietly along, like other men; at other times he would rush on as if he were mad
- HoP 3",112
9154,"The upbringing of his children, as was quite to be expected under the circumstances, was very bad
- HoP 3",105
9158,"In them he gave vent to the wild vehemence of his nature; they are disconnected and contradictory, and were often written in the direst poverty
- HoP 3",151
9159,"They contain a medley of all kinds of astrological and chiromantic superstition, yet lit up here and there with profound and brilliant flashes; there are Alexandrine and Cabalistic mysteries side by side with perfectly lucid psychological observations of his own
- HoP 3",270
9160,"He treated astrologically the life and deeds of Christ
- HoP 3",62
9161,"His positive merit consists, however, rather in the stimulus which he gave to original production, and in this direction he exercised an important influence on his times
- HoP 3",177
9162,"He boasted of the originality and novelty of his ideas, and the craze to be original drove him to the strangest devices
- HoP 3",127
9163,"This represents the first form taken by the newly awakened and energizing reason in its spontaneous activity; to be new and different from others was regarded as tantamount to possessing a private claim to science
- HoP 3",221
9164,"Tommaso Campanella, a student of Aristotle, represents just such another medley of all possible dispositions
- HoP 3",116
9165,"He was born at Stilo, in Calabria, in 1568, and died at Paris in 1639
- HoP 3",77
9166,"Many of his writings still remain to us
- HoP 3",47
9167,"For seven-and-twenty years of his life he was kept in strict imprisonment at Naples67 Such men as he aroused enormous interest and gave great offence, but on their own account they were productive of very little result
- HoP 3",226
9168,"Giordano Bruno was of an equally restless and effervescent temperament, and we see in him a bold rejection of all Catholic beliefs resting on mere authority
- HoP 3",164
9169,"He was less restless than Cardanus; but he had no fixed habitation on the earth
- HoP 3",87
9170,"He was born at Nola in the province of Naples, and lived in the sixteenth century; the year of his birth is not known with certainty
- HoP 3",140
9173,"They appeared under the title Jord
- HoP 3",42
9174,"Rationes articulorum physicorum adversus Peripateticos Parisiis propositorum, Vitebergæ apud Zachariam Cratonem, 1588; he was not successful in them, however, as the position of the Aristotelians was still too well assured
- HoP 3",230
9175,"In Helmstedt he was high in the favour of the Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg in 1589; after that he went to Frankfort-on-Main, where he had several of his works printed
- HoP 3",173
9176,"He was a wandering professor and author
- HoP 3",47
9177,"Finally he came back to Italy in 1592, and lived in Padua for some time undisturbed, but at last he was seized in Venice by the Inquisition, cast into prison, sent on to Rome, and there in the year 1600, refusing to recant, he was burned at the stake as a heretic
- HoP 3",271
9178,"Eye-witnesses, and amongst them Scioppius, recount that he met death with the most unflinching courage
- HoP 3",110
9179,"He had become a Protestant when in Germany, and had broken the vows of his order69  Among both Catholics and Protestants his writings were held to be heretical and atheistic, and therefore they were burned and destroyed, or kept in concealment
- HoP 3",251
9180,"His complete works are hence very seldom met with; the greatest number of them are to be found in the University Library at Gottingen; the fullest account of them is given in Buhle’s History of Philosophy (supra, Vol
- HoP 3",224
9181,"His works are for the most part rare, and in many cases interdicted; in Dresden they are still included among prohibited writings, and are therefore not to be seen there
- HoP 3",177
9182,"Lately70 an edition of them in the Italian language was prepared,71 which possibly has never yet been issued
- HoP 3",116
9183,"Bruno also wrote a great deal in Latin
- HoP 3",46
9184,"Many of his writings are for the above reason very similar in their matter, the form only being different, and in the evolution of his thoughts he never consequently advanced very much nor attained to any results
- HoP 3",220
9185,"But the leading characteristic of his various writings is really to some extent the grand enthusiasm of a noble soul, which has a sense of indwelling spirit, and knows the unity of its own Being and all Being to be the whole life of thought
- HoP 3",248
9186,"There is something bacchantic in his way of apprehending this deep consciousness; it overflows in becoming thus an object of thought, and in the expression of its riches
- HoP 3",177
9187,"But it is only in knowledge that spirit can bring itself forth as a whole; when it has not yet attained to this point of scientific culture, it reaches out after all forms, without bringing them first into due order
- HoP 3",223
9188,"Bruno displays just such an unregulated and multiform profusion; and on that account his expositions have frequently a dreamy, confused, allegorical appearance of mystical enthusiasm
- HoP 3",190
9190,"It is easy to say that he was “a restless being, who could get on with nobody” But whence did this restlessness come to him?
- HoP 3",132
9191,"What he could not get on with was the finite, the evil, the ignoble
- HoP 3",75
9192,"Thence arose his restlessness
- HoP 3",37
9193,"He rose to the one universal substantiality by putting an end to this separation of self-consciousness and nature, whereby both alike are degraded
- HoP 3",154
9194,"God was in self-consciousness, it was admitted, but externally, and as remaining something different from self-consciousness, another reality; while Nature was made by God, being His creature, not an image of Him
- HoP 3",220
9195,"Bruno asserted, in the first place, the unity of life and the universality of the World-Soul, and, in the second place, the indwelling presence of reason; but Bruno in so saying is far from being original, and in fact this doctrine is a mere echo of the Alexandrian
- HoP 3",273
9196,"But in his writings there are two specially marked features
- HoP 3",67
9197,"The first is the nature of his system, based as it is on his leading thoughts, or his philosophic principles generally, namely the Idea as substantial unity
- HoP 3",164
9198,"The second, which is closely connected with the first, is his use of the Art of Lullius; this is specially emphasized and highly esteemed by him, the art of finding differences in the Idea: it he wished to bring into special recognition
- HoP 3",244
9199,"His philosophic thoughts, to express which he sometimes made use of Aristotle’s concepts, give evidence of a peculiar, highly strung and very original mind
- HoP 3",163
9200,"The substance of his general reflections is found in the greatest enthusiasm for the above-mentioned vitality of Nature, divinity, the presence of reason in nature
- HoP 3",171
9201,"His philosophy is thus on the whole certainly Spinozism, Pantheism
- HoP 3",74
9202,"The separation of man from God or the world, all such relations of externality, have been superadded to his living idea of the absolute, universal unity of all things, for the expression of which idea Bruno has been so greatly admired
- HoP 3",242
9203,"In his conception of things the main points are that, on the one hand, he gives the universal determination of matter, and, on the other hand, that of form
- HoP 3",163
9205,"It is the artist within, who shapes and forms the material without
- HoP 3",74
9206,"From within the root or the seed-grain it makes the shoot come forth; from this again it brings the branches, and from them the twigs, and from out of the twigs it calls forth the buds, and leaves, and flowers
- HoP 3",217
9207,"All is planned, prepared and perfected within
- HoP 3",53
9208,"In the same way this universal reason within calls back their saps from the fruits and blossoms to the twigs, and so on
- HoP 3",127
9209,"The universe is thus an infinite animal, in which all things live and move and have their being in modes the most diverse
- HoP 3",129
9211,"Nature and Spirit are not separated; their unity is the formal understanding, in which is contained the pure Notion, not as in consciousness, but as free and independent, remaining within itself, and at the same time exercising activity and passing beyond itself
- HoP 3",270
9212,"The understanding working towards one particular end is the inward form of the thing itself, an inward principle of the understanding
- HoP 3",141
9213,"In dealing with Kant’s philosophy we shall have again to mention this determination of final purpose
- HoP 3",108
9215,"To a certain extent Bruno distinguishes form and matter in substance, which itself, as the aforesaid activity of the Idea, is the unity of form and matter; thus matter has life in itself
- HoP 3",194
9216,"The permanent element in the endless changes of existence is, he says, the first and absolute matter; although without form, it is nevertheless the mother of all forms, and receptive of all forms
- HoP 3",203
9217,"Because matter is not without the first universal form, it is itself principle or in itself final cause
- HoP 3",111
9218,"Form is immanent in matter; the one simply cannot exist without the other; thus matter itself brings about these changes of form, and the same matter runs through them all
- HoP 3",179
9219,"What was at first seed becomes blade, then ear, then bread, chyle, blood, seed of animal, an embryo, a human being, a corpse, then once more earth, stone, or other substance; from sand and water frogs are produced
- HoP 3",221
9220,"Here then we can perceive something which, although it transforms itself into all these things in turn, yet still in itself remains one and the same
- HoP 3",156
9221,"This matter cannot be a body, for bodies have form; nor can it belong to the class which we term properties, attributes, or qualities, for these are liable to change
- HoP 3",173
9222,"Thus nothing seems to be eternal and worthy of the name of a principle, except matter
- HoP 3",93
9223,"Many have for this reason held matter to be the only reality, and all forms to be accidental
- HoP 3",100
9224,"This error arises from the fact of their recognizing only a form of the second kind, and not that necessary first and eternal form, which is the form and source of all forms
- HoP 3",181
9225,"In the same way the aforesaid matter, on account of its identity with the understanding which causes form beforehand, is itself intelligible, as the universal presupposition of all corporeality
- HoP 3",201
9226,"Because it is everything in general, it is nothing in particular, neither air nor water, nor anything else, abstract or otherwise; it has no dimensions, in order to have all dimensions
- HoP 3",192
9227,"The forms of matter are the inward power of matter itself; it is, as intelligible, the very totality of form76 This system of Bruno’s is thus objective Spinozism, and nothing else; one can see how deeply he penetrated
- HoP 3",225
9228,"Bruno here asks the question: “But this first universal form and that first universal matter, how are they united, inseparable?
- HoP 3",135
9229,"Different—and yet one Being?” He answers by making use of the Aristotelian forms of δύναμις and ἐνέργεια: Matter is to be regarded as potentiality; in this way all possible forms of existence in a certain sense are included in the Notion of it
- HoP 3",251
9230,"The passivity of matter must be regarded as pure and absolute
- HoP 3",69
9231,"Now it is impossible to attribute existence to a thing which lacks the power to exist
- HoP 3",93
9232,"Existence has, however, such an express reference to the active mode, that it is at once clear that the one cannot exist without the other, but that each of them presupposes the other
- HoP 3",191
9233,"If therefore at all times a capacity of working, producing, creating, was there, so must there also have been at all times a capacity of being worked upon, produced, created
- HoP 3",181
9234,"The perfect potentiality of the existence of things (matter) cannot precede their actual existence, and just as little can it remain after that is past
- HoP 3",159
9235,"The first and most perfect principle includes all existence in itself, can be all things, and is all things
- HoP 3",115
9237,"If matter were nothing but indeterminate potentiality, how would the determinate be arrived at?
- HoP 3",103
9238,"This simplicity of matter is itself only one moment of form: in wishing therefore to tear asunder matter and form, matter is at once established in one determination of form, but in so doing there is immediately established also the existence of the Other
- HoP 3",263
9239,"Thus the Absolute is determined for Bruno: it is not so with other things, which may exist and also may not exist, and which may be determined in one way or in another way
- HoP 3",179
9240,"In regard to finite things and in finite determinations of the understanding the distinction between form and matter is thus present
- HoP 3",140
9241,"The individual man is at every moment what he may be at that moment, but not everything which he may be in general and with reference to substance
- HoP 3",154
9242,"The things which appear to be different are only modifications of one single thing which includes in its existence all other existence
- HoP 3",142
9243,"The universe, unbegotten Nature, is, however, everything which it can be in reality and at one time, because it includes in itself the whole of matter, as well as the eternal, unchangeable form of its changing forms
- HoP 3",223
9245,"This is Bruno’s fundamental idea
- HoP 3",40
9246,"He says: “To recognize this unity of form and matter in all things, is what reason is striving to attain to
- HoP 3",115
9248,"He represents the original principle, which is elsewhere known as the form, under the Notion of the minimum, which is at the same time the maximum—One, which at the same time is All; the universe is this One in All
- HoP 3",222
9249,"In the universe, he says, the body is not distinguished from the point, nor the centre from the circumference, nor the finite from the infinite, nor the maximum from the minimum
- HoP 3",185
9250,"There is nothing but centre point; or the centre point is everywhere and in everything
- HoP 3",94
9251,"The ancients expressed the same by saying of the Father of the gods, that he really had his dwelling-place in every point of the universe
- HoP 3",145
9252,"It is the universe that first gives to things true reality; it is the substance of all things, the monad, the atom, the spirit poured out on all things, the innermost essence, the pure form80  b
- HoP 3",202
9253,"The second object to which Bruno devoted himself was the so-called Lullian Art, which received its name from its first inventor, the Scholastic Raymundus Lullus (supra, pp
- HoP 3",179
9254,"Bruno adopted this and carried it to completion; he termed it also his ars combinatoria
- HoP 3",95
9255,"This art is in some respects like what we met with in Aristotle under the name of the Topics (Vol
- HoP 3",105
9256,"But the Topics of Aristotle did this in order to apprehend and determine an object in its various aspects, while Bruno rather worked for the sake of lightening the task of memory
- HoP 3",186
9257,"He thus really connected the Lullian Art with the art of mnemonics as practised by the ancients, which has come into notice again in recent times, and which will be found described in greater detail in the Auctor ad Herennium (Libr
- HoP 3",239
9259,"In this way when we repeat it, we have not to say it from memory or out of our head, as we are accustomed to do, but we have only to read it off as if from a table
- HoP 3",171
9260,"The only difficulty lies in making some ingenious connection between the content in question and the picture; that gives rise to the most unholy combinations, and the art is therefore not one to be commended
- HoP 3",215
9261,"Bruno also soon abandoned it, since what had been a matter of memory became a matter of imagination; which was, of course, a descent
- HoP 3",140
9262,"But since with Bruno the diagram is not only a picture of external images, but a system of universal determinations of thought, he certainly gave to this art a deeper inward meaning81  α Bruno passes over to this art from universal ideas which are given
- HoP 3",261
9265,"For Bruno the principle in all this is the understanding generally: None other than the understanding whose activity extends beyond itself, which brings into existence the sensuous world
- HoP 3",194
9266,"It is related to the illumination of the spirit as the sun is related to the eye: it relates therefore to a phenomenal manifold, illuminating this, not itself
- HoP 3",166
9268,"Bruno’s great endeavour is really now to apprehend and demonstrate the modes of organizing this active understanding
- HoP 3",124
9269,"This is presented more in detail as follows: To the pure truth itself, the absolute light, man approaches only; his Being is not absolute Being itself, which alone is the One and First
- HoP 3",192
9270,"He rests only under the shadow of the Idea, whose purity is the light, but which at the same time partakes of the darkness
- HoP 3",130
9271,"The light of substance emanates from this pure First Light, the light of accident emanates from the light of substance
- HoP 3",126
9272,"This we met with also in Proclus (supra, Vol
- HoP 3",52
9273,"This absolute principle in its unity is for Bruno the first matter, and the first act of this principle he names the original light (actus primus lucis)
- HoP 3",160
9275,"Things withdraw themselves from the First Light towards the darkness
- HoP 3",76
9277,"Thus One Being is in all
- HoP 3",32
9278,"That process is the same as this return, and they form a circle
- HoP 3",71
9279,"Nature within her limits can produce all from all, and so the understanding can also know all from all86  ε
- HoP 3",115
9280,"The unity of opposites is explained more in detail as follows: The diversity of shadows is no real opposition
- HoP 3",117
9281,"In the same conception the opposites are known, the beautiful and the ugly, the appropriate and the inappropriate, the perfect and the imperfect, the good and the evil
- HoP 3",175
9282,"Imperfection, evil, ugliness, do not rest upon special ideas of their own; they become known in another conception, not in one peculiar to themselves, which is nothing
- HoP 3",175
9283,"For this that is peculiarly theirs is the non-existent in the existent, the defect in the effect
- HoP 3",104
9284,"The first understanding is the original light; it streams its light out of the innermost to the outermost, and draws it again from the outermost to itself
- HoP 3",162
9285,"Every Being can, according to its capacity, appropriate somewhat of this light87  ζ
- HoP 3",91
9286,"The real element in things is just that which is intelligible, not that which is perceived or felt, or what is peculiar to the individual; whatever else is termed real, the sensuous, is non-Being
- HoP 3",203
9287,"All that comes to pass beneath the sun, all that dwells in the region of matter, falls under the notion of vanity (finitude)
- HoP 3",132
9288,"Seek to take from Ideas a firm basis for thy conceptions, if thou art wise
- HoP 3",82
9289,"The pure light of things is nothing but this knowableness, which proceeds from the first understanding and is directed towards it; the non-existent is not known
- HoP 3",168
9290,"What is here contrast and diversity, is in the first understanding harmony and unity
- HoP 3",92
9291,"Try therefore if thou canst identify the images thou hast received, if thou canst harmonize and unite them; thus thou wilt not render thy mind weary, thy thoughts obscure, and thy memory confused
- HoP 3",203
9293,"To develop this was therefore Bruno’s endeavour; and the determinations, as natural in that divine understanding, correspond with those which appear in the subjective understanding
- HoP 3",188
9294,"Bruno’s art consists only in determining the universal scheme of form, which includes all things within itself, and in showing how its moments express themselves in the different spheres of existence
- HoP 3",207
9295,"The main endeavour of Bruno was thus to represent the All and One, after the method of Lullus, as a system of classes of regular determinations
- HoP 3",151
9297,"The moments of the original form itself are termed Being, goodness (nature or life), and unity
- HoP 3",102
9299,"Thinking, he says, is the capability both of receiving into one’s self this external writing of nature and of imagining and substantiating the inward writing in the outward
- HoP 3",180
9300,"It is one form which develops; it is the same world-principle which causes form in metals, plants and animals, and which in man thinks and organizes outside himself, only that it expresses itself in its operations in an endlessly varied manner throughout the entire world
- HoP 3",279
9302,"He assumes therein twelve principal kinds of writing, or classes of natural forms, to form a starting-point: “Species, Formæ, Simulacra, Imagines, Spectra, Exemplaria, Indicia, Signa, Notæ, Characteres et Sigilli
- HoP 3",220
9303,"Some kinds of writing are connected with the external sense, like external forms, pictures and ideals (extrinseca forma, imago, exemplar); these painting and other plastic arts represent, by imitating Mother Nature
- HoP 3",222
9304,"Some are connected with the inner sense, where—with regard to mass, duration, number—they are magnified, extended in time and multiplied; such are the products of fancy
- HoP 3",176
9305,"Some are connected with a common point of similarity in several things; some are so divergent from the objective nature of things that they are quite imaginary
- HoP 3",167
9307,"All respect is due to this attempt to represent the logical system of the inward artist, the producing thought, in such a way that the forms of external Nature correspond thereto
- HoP 3",186
9309,"Further or more determinate moments Bruno has done nothing more than collect together; when he tries to represent them by figures and classifications, the result is confusion
- HoP 3",182
9310,"The twelve forms laid down as basis neither have their derivation traced nor are they united in one entire system, nor is the further multiplication deduced
- HoP 3",164
9311,"To this part of his subject he devoted several of his writings (De sigillis), and in different works it is presented in different ways; the appearances of things are as letters, or symbols, which correspond with thoughts
- HoP 3",228
9312,"The idea is on the whole praiseworthy compared with the fragmentariness of Aristotle and the Scholastics, according to whom every determination is fixed once for all
- HoP 3",173
9314,"It is a great beginning, to have the thought of unity; and the other point is this attempt to grasp the universe in its development, in the system of its determinations, and to show how the outward appearance is a symbol of ideas
- HoP 3",237
9315,"These are the two aspects of Bruno’s teaching which had to be taken into consideration
- HoP 3",94
9316,"Julius Cæsar Vanini has also to be mentioned as belonging to this period; his first name was really Lucilius
- HoP 3",116
9317,"He has many points of similarity with Bruno, and, like him, he suffered as a martyr on account of philosophy; for he shared Bruno’s fate, which was to be burned at the stake
- HoP 3",181
9318,"He was born in 1586 at Taurozano in the province of Naples
- HoP 3",66
9319,"He wandered from country to country; we find him in Geneva, and then in Lyons, whence he fled to England in order to save himself from the Inquisition
- HoP 3",158
9320,"After two years he returned to Italy
- HoP 3",44
9321,"In Genoa he taught Natural Philosophy on the system of Averroës, but did not bring himself into favour
- HoP 3",110
9322,"In his travels he met with all manner of strange adventures, and engaged in many and various disputations on philosophy and theology
- HoP 3",140
9323,"He became more and more an object of suspicion, and fled from Paris; he was summoned before the tribunal on a charge of impiety, not of heresy
- HoP 3",150
9324,"Franconus, his accuser, stated on oath that Vanini had uttered blasphemies
- HoP 3",82
9326,"But it was of no avail; in 1619 at Toulouse in France he was condemned to the stake, and before the carrying out of this sentence his tongue was torn out by the executioner
- HoP 3",180
9327,"How the case was proved against him is not, however, clear; the proceedings seem to have been in great part due to personal enmity, and to the zeal for persecution which filled the clergy in Toulouse92  Vanini derived his chief stimulus from the originality of Cardanus
- HoP 3",277
9328,"In him we see reason and philosophy taking a direction hostile to theology, while Scholastic philosophy went hand in hand with theology, and theology was supposed to be confirmed thereby
- HoP 3",194
9329,"Art developed in the Catholic Church, but free thought broke off from, and remained alien to it
- HoP 3",103
9330,"In Bruno and Vanini the Church took her revenge for this; she renounced science, and took up a position of hostility to it
- HoP 3",130
9331,"Vanini’s philosophy does not go very far; he admires the living energy of Nature; his reasonings were not deep, but were more of the nature of fanciful ideas
- HoP 3",165
9332,"He always chose the dialogue form; and it is not evident which of the opinions stated are his own
- HoP 3",105
9333,"He wrote commentaries on Aristotle’s works on Physics
- HoP 3",61
9334,"The one is styled: Amphitheatrum æternæ providentiæ divino-magicum, christiano-physicum, nec non astrologo-catholicum, adversus veteres philosophos, Atheos, Epicureos, Peripateticos et Stoicos
- HoP 3",200
9336,"What one finds is assurances from him that he would believe this or that doctrine if he had not received Christian teaching
- HoP 3",131
9337,"Vanini’s tendency, however, was towards naturalism; he showed that it is Nature that is the Deity, that all things had a mechanical genesis
- HoP 3",147
9340,"Another practice of these philosophers was to bring forward all sorts of arguments and theories contradictory of theological dogmas, as so many insoluble difficulties and contradictions brought about by reason, which were, however, by them submitted to faith
- HoP 3",266
9341,"Thus, for instance, Bayle says in the article “Manichæans” found in his critical Dictionnaire—in which he touches on many philosophic conceptions—that the assertion of the existence of two principles cannot be disproved, but that we must submit herein to the Church
- HoP 3",273
9342,"In this fashion all possible arguments were advanced against the Church
- HoP 3",79
9343,"Vanini thus states objections against the Atonement, and brings forward arguments to prove that Nature is God
- HoP 3",117
9345,"Both of them had in vain chosen the dialogue form for their writings
- HoP 3",76
9346,"Vanini certainly made one of the speakers in the Dialogues prove (De naturæ arcanis, p 420) even “out of the text of the Bible, that the devil is mightier than God,” and that therefore God does not rule the world
- HoP 3",220
9347,"Among his arguments are the following: It was against the will of God that Adam and Eve sinned, and thus brought the whole human race to ruin (ad interitum): Christ also was crucified by the powers of darkness
- HoP 3",217
9348,"Moreover it is the will of God that all men should be saved
- HoP 3",67
9349,"But of Catholics there are very few in comparison with the rest of the world, and the Jews often fell away from their faith; the Catholic religion extends only over Spain, France, Italy, Poland and a part of Germany
- HoP 3",223
9350,"If there were to be deducted also the atheists, blasphemers, heretics, whoremongers, adulterers, and so on, there would be still fewer left
- HoP 3",147
9351,"Consequently the devil is mightier than God
- HoP 3",51
9352,"These are arguments of reason; they are not to be refuted; but he submitted himself to the faith
- HoP 3",104
9353,"It is remarkable that no one believed this of him; the reason thereof being that it was impossible for him to be in earnest with the refutation of what he asserted to be rational
- HoP 3",186
9354,"That the refutation was but weak and subjective does not justify anyone in doubting Vanini’s sincerity; for poor reasons may be convincing for the subject, just as the subject holds to his own rights in respect of objective matters
- HoP 3",239
9355,"What lies at the bottom of the proceedings against Vanini is this, that when a man by means of his reason has come to perceive something which seems to him incontrovertible, he cannot but adhere to these definite perceptions, he cannot believe what is opposed to them
- HoP 3",275
9356,"It is impossible to believe that faith is stronger in him than this power of perception
- HoP 3",95
9358,"This susceptibility of the Church is inconsistent, and entangled her in contradictions
- HoP 3",94
9359,"For in earlier times she certainly admitted that reason could not grasp what was revealed, and that it was consequently a matter of little importance to refute and solve by reason the objections which reason itself brought forward
- HoP 3",238
9361,"There is kindled here the strife between so-called revelation and reason, in which the latter emerges independently, and the former is separated from it
- HoP 3",160
9362,"Up to this time both were one, or the light of man was the light of God; man had not a light of his own, but his light was held to be the divine
- HoP 3",152
9363,"The Scholastics had no knowledge having a content of its own beyond the content of religion; philosophy remained entirely formal
- HoP 3",136
9364,"But now it came to have a content of its own, which was opposed to the content of religion; or reason felt at least that it had its own content, or was opposing the form of reasonableness to the immediate content of the other
- HoP 3",233
9365,"This opposition had a different meaning in former times from what it bears now-a-days; the earlier meaning is this, that faith is the doctrine of Christianity, which is given as truth, and by which as truth man has to remain
- HoP 3",232
9366,"We have here faith in this content, and opposed to this stands conviction by means of reason
- HoP 3",100
9367,"But now this faith is transferred into the thinking consciousness itself; it is a relation of self-consciousness itself to the facts which it finds within itself, not to the objective content of the doctrine
- HoP 3",215
9369,"That is the part which has to do with the eternal verities, the part which is of absolute interest for men; this part is in its content essentially speculative, and can be object only for the speculative Notion
- HoP 3",218
9370,"The other part, belief in which is also required, has reference to other external conceptions, which are connected with that content; to this pertains the whole extent of what belongs to history, in the Old and New Testament as well as in the Church
- HoP 3",257
9371,"A belief in all this finite element may be demanded also
- HoP 3",64
9372,"If a man, for instance, did not believe in ghosts, he would be taken for a free-thinker, an atheist: it would be just the same if a man did not believe that Adam in Paradise ate of the forbidden fruit
- HoP 3",208
9373,"Both parts are placed upon the one level; but it tends to the destruction of Church and faith, when belief is demanded for these parts alike
- HoP 3",148
9374,"It is to the external conceptions that attention has been chiefly directed by those who have been decried as opponents of Christianity and as atheists, down to the time of Voltaire
- HoP 3",188
9375,"When external conceptions such as these are held to firmly, it is inevitable that contradictions should be pointed out
- HoP 3",126
9376,"Pierre de la Ramée was born in 1515 in Vermandois, where his father worked as a day-labourer
- HoP 3",100
9378,"Here he found an opportunity of extending his knowledge; he occupied himself with the Aristotelian philosophy and with mathematics, and he distinguished himself in disputation by extraordinary oratorical and dialectical readiness
- HoP 3",237
9379,"In a disputation for obtaining the degree of magister, he came publicly forward with a thesis that caused a great sensation: “All that Aristotle taught is not true;” and the honour fell to him
- HoP 3",200
9380,"Having became magister, he attacked so bitterly and violently the Aristotelian logic and dialectic, that the government took notice of it
- HoP 3",145
9381,"He was now accused of undermining by his anti-Aristotelian opinions the foundations of religion and science; this accusation was brought before the parliament of Paris by the enemies of Ramus, as a criminal case
- HoP 3",219
9382,"But because the parliament appeared disposed to act in a judicial way, and seemed favourably inclined to Ramus, the complaint was withdrawn, and brought before the council of the king
- HoP 3",191
9384,"The interest of the public was intense, but the contest was conducted in the most pedantic way
- HoP 3",102
9385,"On the first day Ramus maintained that the Aristotelian logic and dialectic were imperfect and faulty, because the Organon did not begin with a definition
- HoP 3",162
9386,"The commission decided that a disputation or a dissertation requires indeed a definition, but in dialectic it is not necessary
- HoP 3",134
9387,"On the second day Ramus criticized the Aristotelian logic for its want of arrangement; this, he asserted, is essential
- HoP 3",126
9388,"The majority of the judges, consisting of the commissioner of the king and the two nominees of the opponent Goveanus, now wished to annul the investigation as far as it had gone, and to set to work in another way, since the assertions of Ramus put them in a difficulty
- HoP 3",276
9389,"He appealed to the king, who, however, refused to hear him, and decided that the decision of the judges should be considered final
- HoP 3",138
9390,"Ramus was hence condemned, but the other two took no share in the matter, and, indeed, resigned
- HoP 3",103
9391,"The decision was publicly placarded in all the streets of Paris, and sent to all the academies of learning throughout Europe
- HoP 3",132
9392,"Plays aimed against Ramus were performed in the theatres, greatly to the delight of the Aristotelians
- HoP 3",109
9393,"The public generally took a very lively interest in such disputes, and a number of contests of this kind had already taken place on similar questions of the schools
- HoP 3",172
9395,"Another hot and bitter controversy came before the magistrates as to whether ego amat was as correct as ego amo, and this dispute had to be suppressed by them
- HoP 3",166
9396,"Finally Ramus obtained a public educational appointment, a professorship in Paris; but because he had become a Huguenot he had to vacate this office several times in the internal disquietude that prevailed; on one occasion he even went to travel in Germany
- HoP 3",264
9400,"The efforts of such men are counted as philosophy in as far as they have drawn from their consciousness, from the sphere of human experience, from observation, from what takes place in the world and in the heart
- HoP 3",219
9401,"It is in a philosophy of life that they have comprehended and imparted such experiences; they are thus both entertaining and instructive
- HoP 3",144
9402,"In accordance with the principle on which they worked, they entirely forsook the sources from which Scholastic knowledge had up to this time been derived, and also the methods hitherto prevalent of acquiring it
- HoP 3",218
9403,"But because they do not make the question of highest interest to Philosophy the object of their investigation, and do not reason from thought, they do not properly belong to the history of Philosophy, but to general culture and to the healthy human understanding
- HoP 3",270
9404,"They have contributed to man’s taking a greater interest in his own affairs, to his obtaining confidence in himself; and this is their main service
- HoP 3",155
9405,"Man has looked within his heart again and given to it its proper value; then he has restored to his own heart and understanding, to his faith, the essence of the relationship of the individual to absolute existence
- HoP 3",222
9406,"Although still a divided heart, this division, this yearning, has become a disunion within itself; and man feels this disunion within himself, and along with that his rest in himself
- HoP 3",190
9407,"But here we must notice a transition, with which we are concerned, on account of the universal principle which in it is known in a higher way and in its true authority
- HoP 3",175
9409,"From the Beyond man was thus called into the presence of spirit, as earth and her bodily objects, human virtues and morality, the individual heart and conscience, began to have some value to him
- HoP 3",202
9410,"In the church, if marriage was not held to be immoral, self-restraint and celibacy were considered higher, but now marriage came to be looked on as a divine institution
- HoP 3",176
9412,"The blind obedience by which human freedom was suppressed, was the third vow taken by the monks, as against which freedom, like marriage and property, was now also recognized as divine
- HoP 3",192
9413,"Similarly on the side of knowledge man turned back into himself from the Beyond of authority; and reason was recognized as the absolutely universal, and hence as divine
- HoP 3",176
9415,"There is indeed a mediation present still by means of doctrine, perception, the observation of self and of one’s actions; but that is a mediation without a separating wall, while formerly a brazen wall of division was present separating the laity from the church
- HoP 3",270
9416,"It is thus the spirit of God that must dwell within the heart of man, and this indwelling spirit must operate in him
- HoP 3",124
9418,"It was with Luther first of all that freedom of spirit began to exist in embryo, and its form indicated that it would remain in embryo
- HoP 3",142
9419,"This beginning of the reconciliation of man with himself, whereby divinity is brought into man’s actuality, is thus, at first principle alone
- HoP 3",149
9420,"The unfolding of this freedom and the self-reflecting grasp of the same was a subsequent step, in the same way as was the working out of the Christian doctrine in the Church in its time
- HoP 3",193
9424,"Art and industry receive through this principle new activity, since now their activity is justified
- HoP 3",107
9425,"But we always find the principle of personal spirituality and independence at first limited to particular spheres of objects merely, in accordance with its content
- HoP 3",171
9427,"This, then, is the Lutheran faith, in accordance with which man stands in a relation to God which involves his personal existence: that is, his piety and the hope of his salvation and the like all demand that his heart, his subjectivity, should be present in them
- HoP 3",271
9429,"Thus here the principle of subjectivity, of pure relation to me personally, ie freedom, is recognized, and not merely so, but it is clearly demanded that in religious worship this alone should be considered
- HoP 3",214
9430,"The highest confirmation of the principle is that it alone has value in the eyes of God, that faith and the subjection of the individual heart are alone essential: in this way this principle of Christian freedom is first presented and brought to a true consciousness
- HoP 3",274
9431,"Thereby a place has been set apart in the depths of man’s inmost nature, in which alone he is at home with himself and at home with God; and with God alone is he really himself, in the conscience he can be said to be at home with himself
- HoP 3",245
9432,"This sense of being at home should not be capable of being destroyed through others; no one should presume to have a place therein
- HoP 3",138
9433,"All externality in relation to me is thereby banished, just as is the externality of the Host; it is only in communion and faith that I stand in relation to God
- HoP 3",168
9434,"The distinction between the laity and the priests is by it removed; there are no longer any laymen, for in religion each by himself is enjoined to know personally what it is
- HoP 3",181
9435,"Responsibility is not to be avoided; good works without spiritual reality in them are no longer of avail; there must be the heart which relates itself directly to God without mediation, without the Virgin, and without the Saints
- HoP 3",236
9436,"This is the great principle—that all externality disappears in the point of the absolute relation to God; along with this externality, this estrangement of self, all servitude has also disappeared
- HoP 3",204
9437,"With it is connected our ceasing to tolerate prayer in foreign tongues, or to study the sciences in such
- HoP 3",112
9438,"In speech man is productive; it is the first externality that he gives himself, the simplest form of existence which he reaches in consciousness
- HoP 3",152
9439,"This first form is broken up and rendered foreign if man is in an alien tongue to express or conceive to himself what concerns his highest interest
- HoP 3",155
9440,"This breach with the first entrance into consciousness is accordingly removed; to have one’s own right to speak and think in one’s own language really belongs to liberty
- HoP 3",177
9441,"This is of infinite importance, and without this form of being-at-home-with-self subjective freedom could not have existed; Luther could not have accomplished his Reformation without translating the Bible into German
- HoP 3",224
9442,"Now the principle of subjectivity has thus become a moment in religion itself, and in this way it has received its absolute recognition, and has been grasped as a whole in the form in which it can only be a moment in religion
- HoP 3",233
9443,"The injunction to worship God in spirit is now fulfilled
- HoP 3",64
9444,"Spirit, however, is merely conditioned by the free spirituality of the subject
- HoP 3",86
9445,"For it is this alone which can be related to spirit; a subject who is not free does not stand in an attitude of spirituality, does not worship God in spirit
- HoP 3",164
9446,"This is the general signification of the principle
- HoP 3",58
9447,"Now this principle was at first grasped in relation to religious objects only, and thereby it has indeed received its absolute justification, but still it has not been extended to the further development of the subjective principle itself
- HoP 3",246
9448,"Yet in so far as man has come to the consciousness of being reconciled to himself, and of only being able to reconcile himself in his personal existence, he has in his actuality likewise attained another form
- HoP 3",216
9449,"The otherwise hearty and vigorous man may also, in as far as he enjoys, do so with a good conscience; the enjoyment of life for its own sake is no longer regarded as something which is to be given up, for monkish renunciation is renounced
- HoP 3",246
9450,"But to any other content the principle did not at first extend
- HoP 3",70
9451,"Yet further, the religious content has more specially been apprehended as concrete, as it is for the recollection, and into this spiritual freedom the beginning and the possibility of an unspiritual mode of regarding things has thus entered
- HoP 3",248
9452,"The content of the Credo, speculative as it is in itself, has, that is to say, an historical side
- HoP 3",105
9453,"Within this barren form the old faith of the church has been admitted and allowed to exist, so that in this form it has to be regarded by the subject as the highest truth
- HoP 3",178
9454,"The result then follows that all development of the dogmatic content in a speculative manner is quite set aside
- HoP 3",119
9455,"What was required is man’s inward assurance of his deliverance, of his salvation—the relation of the subjective spirit to the absolute, the form of subjectivity as aspiration, repentance, conversion
- HoP 3",206
9456,"This new principle has been laid down as paramount, so that the content of truth is clearly of importance; but the teaching respecting the nature and the process of God is grasped in the form in which it at first appears for the ordinary conception
- HoP 3",256
9458,"This immersion, his penitence, contrition, conversion, this occupation of the subject with himself, has become the moment of first importance; but the subject has not immersed himself in the content, and the earlier immersion of spirit therein has also been rejected
- HoP 3",274
9461,"In this principle the religious content of the Christian Church is thus retained, and it obtains its confirmation through the testimony of spirit that this content shall only hold good for me in as far as it makes its influence felt in my conscience and heart
- HoP 3",267
9463,"Truth is what it is in my mind; and, on the other hand, my spirit is only then in its proper attitude to truth when truth is within it, when the spirit and its content are related thus
- HoP 3",192
9464,"One cannot be isolated from the other
- HoP 3",45
9466,"The doctrine has to prove itself by the condition of my heart, by penitence, conversion and joy in God
- HoP 3",110
9467,"In doctrine we begin with the external content, and thus it is external only; but taken thus, independently of the state of my mind, it properly speaking has no significance
- HoP 3",181
9468,"Now this beginning is, as Christian baptism and education, a working upon the nature in addition to an acquaintance with externals
- HoP 3",138
9469,"The truth of the gospel and of Christian doctrines only, however, exists in true relation to the same; it is really so to speak a use of the content to make it educative
- HoP 3",177
9470,"And this is just what has been said, that the nature is reconstructed and sanctified in itself, and it is this sanctification for which the content is a true one
- HoP 3",169
9471,"No further use can be made of the content than to build up and edify the mind, and awaken it to assurance, joy, penitence, conversion
- HoP 3",141
9472,"Another and wrong relation to the content is to take it in an external way, eg according to the great new principle of exegesis, and to treat the writings of the New Testament like those of a Greek, Latin or other author, critically, philologically, historically
- HoP 3",270
9473,"Spirit is alone in true relation to spirit; and it is a wrong beginning of a wooden and unyielding exegesis to prove in such an external and philological way the truth of the Christian religion
- HoP 3",201
9474,"This has been done by orthodoxy, which thereby renders the content devoid of spirituality
- HoP 3",97
9475,"This, then, is the first relation of spirit to this content; here the content is indeed essential, but it is as essential that the holy and sanctifying spirit should bear a relation to it
- HoP 3",195
9476,"This spirit is, however, in the second place really thinking spirit likewise
- HoP 3",84
9477,"Thought as such must also develop itself therein, and that really as this form of inmost unity of spirit with itself; thought must come to the distinction and contemplation of this content, and pass over into this form of the purest unity of spirit with itself
- HoP 3",268
9478,"At first thought, however, reveals itself as abstract thought alone, and it possesses as such a relation to theology and religion
- HoP 3",137
9479,"The content which is here in question, even in so far as it is historic merely and externally accepted, must yet be religious; the unfolding of the nature of God must be present therein
- HoP 3",193
9480,"In this we have the further demand that the thought for which the inward nature of God is, should also set itself in relation to this content
- HoP 3",149
9481,"But inasmuch as thought is at first understanding and the metaphysic of the understanding, it will remove from the content the rational Idea and make it so empty that only external history remains, which is devoid of interest
- HoP 3",233
9482,"The third position arrived at is that of concrete speculative thought
- HoP 3",77
9483,"According to the standpoint which has just been given, and as religious feeling and its form are here determined, all speculative content as such, as well as its developments, are at first rejected
- HoP 3",205
9484,"And as for the enrichment of the Christian conceptions through the treasures of the philosophy of the ancient world, and through the profound ideas of all earlier oriental religions, and the like,—all this is set aside
- HoP 3",226
9485,"The content had objectivity; but this merely signified that the objective content, without subsisting for itself, was to constitute the beginning only, on which the mind had spiritually to build up and sanctify itself
- HoP 3",225
9486,"All the enrichment of the content whereby it became philosophic, is thus abandoned, and what follows later simply is that the mind, as thinking, again immerses itself in itself, in order to be concrete and rational
- HoP 3",222
9490,"Over against the religious life an external world stood as a natural world—a world of heart or feeling, of desire, of human nature—which had value only in as far as it was overcome
- HoP 3",188
9491,"This mutual independence of the two worlds had much attention bestowed on it throughout the Middle Ages; the opposition was attacked on all quarters and in the end overcome
- HoP 3",180
9492,"But since the relation of mankind to the divine life exists upon earth, this conquest at first presented the appearance of bringing with it the destruction of the church and of the eternal through the sensuous desires of man
- HoP 3",232
9493,"The eternal truth was likewise grafted upon the dry, formal understanding, so that we might say that the separation of self-consciousness has in itself disappeared, and thereby a possibility has been given of obtaining reconciliation
- HoP 3",241
9497,"It eats away the inward substance, but the appearance, the outward form, still remains; at the end, however, it is an empty shell, the new form breaks forth
- HoP 3",164
9498,"In such times this spirit appears as if it—having so far proceeded in its development at a snail’s pace, and having even retrograded and become estranged from itself—had suddenly adopted seven-leagued boots
- HoP 3",214
9500,"In the affairs of this world the understanding developed; man became conscious of his will and his achievements, took pleasure in the earth and its soil, as also in his occupations, because right and understanding were there present
- HoP 3",240
9501,"With the discovery of gunpowder the individual passion of battle was lost
- HoP 3",81
9503,"America was discovered, its treasures and people—nature, man himself; navigation was the higher romance of commerce
- HoP 3",123
9504,"The present world was again present to man as worthy of the interests of mind; thinking mind was again capable of action
- HoP 3",128
9505,"Now the Reformation of Luther had inevitably to come—the appeal to the sensus communis which does not recognize the authority of the Fathers or of Aristotle, but only the inward personal spirit which quickens and animates, in contradistinction to works
- HoP 3",260
9506,"In this way the Church lost her power against it, for her principle was within it and no longer lacking to it
- HoP 3",117
9507,"To the finite and present due honour is accorded; from this honour the work of science proceeds
- HoP 3",103
9508,"We thus see that the finite, the inward and outward present, becomes a matter of experience, and through the understanding is elevated into universality; men desire to understand laws and forces, ie to transform the individual of perceptions into the form of universality
- HoP 3",279
9509,"The other side is that the eternal, which is in and for itself true, is also known and comprehended through the pure heart itself; the individual mind appropriates to itself the eternal
- HoP 3",193
9510,"This is the Lutheran faith without any other accessories—works, as they were called
- HoP 3",91
9511,"Everything had value only as it was grasped by the heart, and not as a mere thing
- HoP 3",89
9512,"The content ceases to be an objective thing; God is thus in spirit alone, He is not a beyond but the truest reality of the individual
- HoP 3",141
9513,"Pure thought is likewise one form of inwardness; it also approaches absolute existence and finds itself justified in apprehending the same
- HoP 3",146
9515,"The main interest hence is, not so much the thinking of the objects in their truth, as the thinking and understanding of the objects, the thinking this unity itself, which is really the being conscious of a presupposed object
- HoP 3",233
9516,"The getting rid of the formal culture of the logical understanding and the monstrosities of which it was composed, was more essential than the extension of it: investigation in such a case becomes dissipated and diffused, and passes into the false infinite
- HoP 3",264
9517,"The general points of view which in modern philosophy we reach are hence somewhat as follows:—  1
- HoP 3",105
9519,"This highest severance is the opposition between thought and Being, the comprehending of whose unity from this time forward constitutes the interest of all philosophies
- HoP 3",176
9521,"The bond remains, but for this reason it is clearly implicit: theology throughout is merely what philosophy is, for this last is simply thought respecting it
- HoP 3",165
9522,"It does not help theology to strive against philosophy, or to say that it wishes to know nothing about it, and that philosophic maxims are thus to be set aside
- HoP 3",167
9523,"It has always to do with the thought that it brings along with it, and these its subjective conceptions, its home and private metaphysics, are thus frequently a quite uncultured, uncritical thought—the thought of the street
- HoP 3",231
9525,"Thus, when thought comes forth on its own account, we thereby separate ourselves from theology; we shall, however, consider one other in whom both are still in unity
- HoP 3",173
9526,"This individual is Jacob Boehme, for since mind now moves in its own domains, it is found partly in the natural and finite world, and partly in the inward, and this at first is the Christian
- HoP 3",198
9527,"For this is ours, since it is subjectivity
- HoP 3",50
9528,"The principle of modern philosophy is hence not a free and natural thought, because it has the opposition of thought and nature before it as a fact of which it is conscious
- HoP 3",180
9529,"Spirit and nature, thought and Being, are the two infinite sides of the Idea, which can for the first time truly make its appearance when its sides are grasped for themselves in their abstraction and totality
- HoP 3",216
9530,"Plato comprehended it as the bond, as limiting and as infinite, as one and many, simple and diverse, but not as thought and Being; when we first thinkingly overcome this opposition it signifies comprehending the unity
- HoP 3",225
9531,"This is the standpoint of philosophic consciousness generally; but the way in which this unity must be thinkingly developed is a double one
- HoP 3",147
9533,"Experience constitutes the first of these methods, viz Realism
- HoP 3",70
9534,"Philosophy now signified, or had as its main attribute, self-thought and the acceptance of the present as that in which truth lay, and which was thereby knowable
- HoP 3",169
9535,"All that is speculative is pared and smoothed down in order to bring it under experience
- HoP 3",96
9536,"This present is the existent external nature, and spiritual activity as the political world and as subjective activity
- HoP 3",126
9537,"The way to truth was to begin from this hypothesis, but not to remain with it in its external self-isolating actuality, but to lead it to the universal
- HoP 3",159
9538,"The activities of that first method operate, to begin with, on physical nature, from the observation of which men derive universal laws, and on this basis their knowledge is founded; the science of nature, however, only reaches to the stage of reflection
- HoP 3",262
9539,"This kind of experimental physics was once called, and is still called philosophy, as Newton’s Principia philosophiæ naturalis (Vol
- HoP 3",139
9540,"This work is one in which the methods of the finite sciences through observation and deduction are alone present—those sciences which the French still call the sciences exactes
- HoP 3",184
9541,"To this, the understanding of the individual, piety was opposed, and hence in this respect philosophy was termed worldly wisdom (Vol
- HoP 3",140
9542,"Here the Idea in its infinitude is not itself the object of knowledge; but a determinate content is raised into the universal, or this last in its determinateness for the understanding is derived from observation, just as is, for instance, done in Keppler’s Laws
- HoP 3",270
9543,"In Scholastic philosophy, on the other hand, man’s power of observation was set aside, and disputations respecting nature at that time proceeded from abstruse hypotheses
- HoP 3",177
9545,"Before this popes anointed kings, just as was done in Old Testament times to those appointed by God; it was in the Old Testament that the tithe was commanded; the forbidden degrees of relationship in marriage were also adopted from the Mosaic laws
- HoP 3",255
9546,"It may easily be conceived how much nonsense was in this manner concocted
- HoP 3",81
9547,"Now, however, right was sought for in man himself, and in history, and what had been accounted right both in peace and in war was explained
- HoP 3",147
9548,"In this way books were composed which even now are constantly quoted in the Parliament of England
- HoP 3",105
9549,"Men further observed the desires which could be satisfied in the state and the manner in which satisfaction could be given to them, in order thus from man himself, from man of the past as well as of the present, to learn what is right
- HoP 3",242
9550,"The second method, that of Idealism, proceeds from what is inward; according to it everything is in thought, mind itself is all content
- HoP 3",143
9551,"Here the Idea itself is made the object; that signifies the thinking it and from it proceeding to the determinate
- HoP 3",121
9553,"In France abstract universality was the more predominant; from England experience took its rise, and even now it is there held in the greatest respect; Germany proceeded from the concrete Idea, from the inwardness of mind and spirit
- HoP 3",240
9554,"The questions of present philosophy, the opposites, the content which occupies the attention of these modern times, are as follows:—  a
- HoP 3",143
9555,"The first form of the opposition which we have already touched upon in the Middle Ages is the Idea of God and His Being, and the task imposed is to deduce the existence of God, as pure spirit, from thought
- HoP 3",213
9556,"Both sides must be comprehended through thought as absolute unity; the extremest opposition is apprehended as gathered into one unity
- HoP 3",141
9557,"Other subjects which engage our attention are connected with the same general aim, namely, the bringing about of the inward reconciliation in the opposition which exists between knowledge and its object
- HoP 3",210
9558,"The second form of opposition is that of Good and Evil—the opposition of the assertion of independent will to the positive and universal; the origin of evil must be known
- HoP 3",178
9559,"Evil is plainly the “other,” the negation of God as Holiness; because He is, because He is wise, good, and at the same time almighty, evil is contradictory to Him; an endeavour is made to reconcile this contradiction
- HoP 3",224
9560,"The individual is clearly not determined in any other way than from himself, he is the absolute beginning of determination; in the ‘I,’ in the self, a power of decision is clearly to be found
- HoP 3",199
9561,"This freedom is in opposition to the theory that God alone is really absolutely determining
- HoP 3",99
9562,"Further, when that which happens is in futurity, the determining of it through God is regarded as Providence and the fore-knowledge of God
- HoP 3",146
9563,"In this, however, a new contradiction is involved, inasmuch as because God’s knowledge is not merely subjective, that which God knows likewise is
- HoP 3",153
9564,"Further still, human freedom is in opposition to necessity as the determinateness of nature; man is dependent on nature, and the external as well as the inward nature of man is his necessity as against his freedom
- HoP 3",221
9565,"Considered objectively, this opposition is that between final causes and efficient causes, ie between the acts of freedom and the acts of necessity
- HoP 3",155
9567,"These matters occupy the attention of science, and they are of a completely different nature from the interests of ancient philosophy
- HoP 3",141
9568,"The difference is this, that here there is a consciousness of an opposition, which is certainly likewise contained in the subjects with which the learning of the ancients was occupied, but which had not come to consciousness
- HoP 3",232
9569,"This consciousness of the opposition, this ‘Fall,’ is the main point of interest in the conception of the Christian religion
- HoP 3",132
9570,"The bringing about in thought of the reconciliation which is accepted in belief, now constitutes the whole interest of knowledge
- HoP 3",136
9571,"Implicitly it has come to pass; for knowledge considers itself qualified to bring about in itself this recognition of the reconciliation
- HoP 3",144
9572,"The philosophic systems are therefore no more than modes of this absolute unity, and only the concrete unity of those opposites is the truth
- HoP 3",148
9573,"As regards the stages which were reached in the progress of this knowledge we have to mention three of the principal
- HoP 3",124
9574,"First of all we find the union of those opposites stated; and to prove it genuine attempts are made, though not yet determined in purity
- HoP 3",144
9575,"The second stage is the metaphysical union; and here, with Descartes, the philosophy of modern times as abstract thought properly speaking begins
- HoP 3",153
9576,"Thinking understanding seeks to bring to pass the union, inasmuch as it investigates with its pure thought-determinations; this is in the first place the standpoint of metaphysics as such
- HoP 3",195
9577,"In the second place, we have to consider negation, the destruction of this metaphysics—the attempt to consider knowledge on its own account, and the determinations which proceed from it
- HoP 3",193
9578,"In respect to the external history and the lives of the philosophers, it will strike us that from this time on, these appear to be very different from those of the philosophers of ancient times, whom we regarded as self-sufficing individualities
- HoP 3",253
9583,"In the Middle Ages it was chiefly the clergy, doctors of theology, who occupied themselves with philosophy
- HoP 3",114
9584,"In the transition period the philosophers showed themselves to be in an inward warfare with themselves and in an external warfare with their surroundings, and their lives were spent in a wild, unsettled fashion
- HoP 3",218
9585,"In modern times things are very different; now we no longer see philosophic individuals who constitute a class by themselves
- HoP 3",132
9586,"They live, not independently, but in the relation of citizens, or they occupy public offices and take part in the life of the state
- HoP 3",139
9587,"Certainly they may be private persons, but if so, their position as such does not in any way isolate them from their other relationships
- HoP 3",144
9588,"They are involved in present conditions, in the world and its work and progress
- HoP 3",87
9589,"Thus their philosophy is only by the way, a sort of luxury and superfluity
- HoP 3",82
9590,"This difference is really to be found in the manner in which outward conditions have taken shape after the building up of the inward world of religion
- HoP 3",158
9592,"This connection is of such power that every individuality is under its dominion, and yet at the same time can construct for itself an inward world
- HoP 3",154
9594,"Now, on the contrary, with the higher degree of strength attained by the inward side of the individual, he may hand the external over to chance; just as he leaves clothing to the contingencies of fashion, not considering it worth while to exert his understanding upon it
- HoP 3",278
9595,"The external he leaves to be determined by the order which is present in the particular sphere in which his lot is cast
- HoP 3",127
9596,"The circumstances of life are, in the true sense, private affairs, determined by outward conditions, and do not contain anything worthy of our notice
- HoP 3",157
9597,"Life becomes scholarly, uniform, commonplace, it connects itself with outwardly given relationships and cannot represent or set itself forth as a form pertaining only to itself
- HoP 3",184
9598,"Man must not take up the character of showing himself an independent form, and giving himself a position in the world created by himself
- HoP 3",144
9599,"Because the objective power of external relationships is infinitely great, and for that reason the way in which I perforce am placed in them has become a matter of indifference to me, personality and the individual life generally are equally indifferent
- HoP 3",261
9600,"A philosopher, it is said, should live as a philosopher, ie, should be independent of the external relationships of the world, and should give up occupying himself with and troubling himself concerning them
- HoP 3",214
9601,"But thus circumscribed in respect of all necessities, more especially of culture, no one can suffice for himself; he must seek to act in connection with others
- HoP 3",167
9603,"Thus in earlier times bravery was individual; while modern bravery consists in each not acting after his own fashion, but relying on his connection with others—and this constitutes his whole merit
- HoP 3",204
9604,"The calling of philosopher is not, like that of the monks, an organized condition
- HoP 3",89
9605,"Members of academies of learning are no doubt organized in part, but even a special calling like theirs sinks into the ordinary commonplace of state or class relationships, because admission thereinto is outwardly determined
- HoP 3",232
9606,"The real matter is to remain faithful to one’s aims
- HoP 3",59
9607,"SECTION ONE  MODERN PHILOSOPHY IN ITS FIRST STATEMENT   The first two philosophers whom we have to consider are Bacon and Boehme; there is as complete a disparity between these individuals as between their systems of philosophy
- HoP 3",235
9608,"None the less both agree that mind operates in the content of its knowledge as in its own domain, and this consequently appears as concrete Being
- HoP 3",153
9609,"This domain in Bacon is the finite, natural world; in Boehme it is the inward, mystical, godly Christian life and existence; for the former starts from experience and induction, the latter from God and the pantheism of the Trinity
- HoP 3",238
9611,"He is therefore instanced as in the fore-front of all this empirical philosophy, and even now our countrymen like to adorn their works with sententious sayings culled from him
- HoP 3",183
9612,"Baconian philosophy thus usually means a philosophy which is founded on the observation of the external or spiritual nature of man in his inclinations, desires, rational and judicial qualities
- HoP 3",200
9613,"From these conclusions are drawn, and general conceptions, laws pertaining to this domain, are thus discovered
- HoP 3",118
9614,"Bacon has entirely set aside and rejected the scholastic method of reasoning from remote abstractions and being blind to what lies before one’s eyes
- HoP 3",156
9615,"He takes as his standpoint the sensuous manifestation as it appears to the cultured man, as the latter reflects upon it; and this is conformable to the principle of accepting the finite and worldly as such
- HoP 3",213
9616,"Bacon was born in London in 1561
- HoP 3",40
9617,"His progenitors and relatives held high office in the state, and his father was Keeper of the Great Seal to Queen Elizabeth
- HoP 3",131
9618,"He in his turn, having been educated to follow the same vocation, at once devoted himself to the business of the state, and entered upon an important career
- HoP 3",164
9619,"He early displayed great talent, and at the age of nineteen he produced a work on the condition of Europe (De statu Europæ)
- HoP 3",131
9620,"Bacon in his youth attached himself to the Earl of Essex, the favourite of Elizabeth, through whose support he, who as a younger son had to see his paternal estate pass to his elder brother, soon attained to better circumstances, and was elevated to a higher position
- HoP 3",275
9621,"Bacon, however, sullied his fame by the utmost ingratitude and faithlessness towards his protector; for he is accused of having been prevailed upon by the enemies of the Earl after his fall to charge him publicly with High Treason
- HoP 3",238
9623,"He likewise made a rich marriage, though he soon squandered all his means, and high though his position was, he stooped to intrigues and was guilty of accepting bribes in the most barefaced manner
- HoP 3",204
9624,"Thereby he brought upon himself the ill-will both of people and of nobles, so that he was prosecuted, and his case was tried before Parliament
- HoP 3",150
9625,"He was fined 40,000l, thrown into the Tower, and his name was struck out of the list of peers; during the trial and while he was in prison he showed the greatest weakness of character
- HoP 3",191
9627,"It was not so much his innocence as the fact that those who ruined him had made themselves hated to an equal degree through their rule, that caused the hatred and indignation against Bacon to be somewhat mitigated
- HoP 3",221
9628,"But he neither recovered his own sense of self-respect nor the personal esteem of others, which he had lost through his former conduct
- HoP 3",142
9630,"For they appear to constitute that people in Europe which, limited to the understanding of actuality, is destined, like the class of shopkeepers and workmen in the State, to live always immersed in matter, and to have actuality but not reason as object
- HoP 3",260
9631,"Bacon won great praise by showing how attention is to be paid to the outward and inward manifestations of Nature, and the esteem in which his name is thus held is greater than can be ascribed directly to his merit
- HoP 3",221
9632,"It has become the universal tendency of the time and of the English mode of reasoning, to proceed from facts, and to judge in accordance with them
- HoP 3",154
9633,"Because Bacon gave expression to the tendency, and men require to have a leader and originator for any particular manner of thinking, he is credited with having given to knowledge this impulse towards experimental philosophy generally
- HoP 3",242
9634,"But many cultured men have spoken and thought regarding what concerns and interests mankind, regarding state affairs, mind, heart, external nature, &c, in accordance with experience and in accordance with a cultured knowledge of the world
- HoP 3",246
9636,"He thus did not escape the corruption of those who stood at the helm of the state
- HoP 3",89
9637,"With all the depravity of his character he was a man of mind and clear perception; he did not, however, possess the power of reasoning through thoughts and notions that are universal
- HoP 3",190
9638,"We do not find in him a methodical or scientific manner of regarding things, but only the external reasoning of a man of the world
- HoP 3",138
9639,"Knowledge of the world he possessed in the highest degree: “rich imagination, powerful wit, and the penetrating wisdom which he displays upon that most interesting of all subjects, commonly called the world
- HoP 3",214
9640,"This last appears to us to have been the characteristical quality of Bacon’s genius
- HoP 3",91
9641,"It was men rather than things that he had studied, the mistakes of philosophers rather than the errors of philosophy
- HoP 3",124
9642,"In fact he was no lover of abstract reasoning,” and although it pertains to philosophy, we find as little as possible of it in him
- HoP 3",138
9643,"General reasoning is absolutely essential in philosophy; the want of it is marked in Bacon’s writings”96 His practical writings are specially interesting; but we do not find the bright flashes of genius that we expected
- HoP 3",227
9645,"His is a consideration of the present, he makes the most of, and ascribes value to it as it appears; the existent is thus regarded with open eyes, respect is paid to it as to what reigns pre-eminent, and this sensuous perception is reverenced and recognized
- HoP 3",265
9646,"Here a confidence on the part of reason in itself and in nature is awakened; it thinkingly applies itself to nature, certain of finding the truth in it, since both are in themselves harmonious
- HoP 3",200
9648,"It is only through this method of investigation introduced by him that he is noteworthy—it is in that way alone that he can be considered to belong to the history of the sciences and of philosophy
- HoP 3",204
9649,"And through this principle of methodical knowledge he has likewise produced a great effect upon his times, by drawing attention to what was lacking in the sciences, both in their methods and in their content
- HoP 3",215
9650,"He set forth the general principles of procedure in an empirical philosophy
- HoP 3",83
9651,"The spirit of the philosophy of Bacon is to take experience as the true and only source of knowledge, and then to regulate the thought concerning it
- HoP 3",156
9653,"What Cicero says of Socrates may be said of Bacon, that he brought Philosophy down to the world, to the homes and every-day lives of men (Vol
- HoP 3",149
9654,"To a certain extent knowledge from the absolute Notion may assume an air of superiority over this knowledge; but it is essential, as far as the Idea is concerned, that the particularity of the content should be developed
- HoP 3",228
9655,"The Notion is an essential matter, but as such its finite side is just as essential
- HoP 3",91
9656,"Mind gives presence, external existence, to itself; to come to understand this extension, the world as it is, the sensuous universe, to understand itself as this, ie with its manifest, sensuous extension, is one side of things
- HoP 3",234
9657,"The other side is the relation to the Idea
- HoP 3",50
9658,"Abstraction in and for itself must determine and particularize itself
- HoP 3",77
9659,"The Idea is concrete, self-determining, it has the principle of development; and perfect knowledge is always developed
- HoP 3",126
9660,"A conditional knowledge in respect of the Idea merely signifies that the working out of the development has not yet advanced very far
- HoP 3",141
9661,"But we have to deal with this development; and for this development and determination of the particular from the Idea, so that the knowledge of the universe, of nature, may be cultivated—for this, the knowledge of the particular is necessary
- HoP 3",249
9662,"This particularity must be worked out on its own account; we must become acquainted with empirical nature, both with the physical and with the human
- HoP 3",156
9663,"The merit of modern times is to have accomplished or furthered these ends; it was in the highest degree unsatisfactory when the ancients attempted the work
- HoP 3",163
9664,"Empiricism is not merely an observing, hearing, feeling, etc, a perception of the individual; for it really sets to work to find the species, the universal, to discover laws
- HoP 3",181
9665,"Now because it does this, it comes within the territory of the Notion—it begets what pertains to the region of the Idea; it thus prepares the empirical material for the Notion, so that the latter can then receive it ready for its use
- HoP 3",241
9666,"If the science is perfected the Idea must certainly issue forth of itself; science as such no longer commences from the empiric
- HoP 3",135
9667,"But in order that this science may come into existence, we must have the progression from the individual and particular to the universal—an activity which is a reaction on the given material of empiricism in order to bring about its reconstruction
- HoP 3",255
9668,"The demand of a priori knowledge, which seems to imply that the Idea should construct from itself, is thus a reconstruction only, or what is in religion accomplished through sentiment and feeling
- HoP 3",203
9669,"The whole of the Idea in itself is science as perfected and complete; but the other side is the beginning, the process of its origination
- HoP 3",145
9670,"This process of the origination of science is different from its process in itself when it is complete, just as is the process of the history of Philosophy and that of Philosophy itself
- HoP 3",193
9671,"In every science principles are commenced with; at the first these are the results of the particular, but if the science is completed they are made the beginning
- HoP 3",169
9672,"The case is similar with Philosophy; the working out of the empirical side has really become the conditioning of the Idea, so that this last may reach its full development and determination
- HoP 3",197
9674,"In consciousness it then adopts the attitude of having cut away the bridge from behind it; it appears to be free to launch forth in its ether only, and to develop without resistance in this medium; but it is another matter to attain to this ether and to development in it
- HoP 3",279
9675,"Bacon’s fame rests on two works
- HoP 3",39
9676,"In the first place, he has the merit of having in his work De augmentis scientiarum presented to us a systematic encyclopedia of the sciences, an outline which must undoubtedly have caused a sensation amongst his contemporaries
- HoP 3",235
9677,"It is important to set before men’s eyes a well arranged picture such as this of the whole, when that whole has not been grasped in thought
- HoP 3",147
9678,"This encyclopedia gives a general classification of the sciences; the principles of the classification are regulated in accordance with the differences in the intellectual capacities
- HoP 3",190
9679,"Bacon thus divides human learning according to the faculties of memory, imagination, and reason, for he distinguishes what pertains (1) to memory; (2) to imagination; (3) to reason
- HoP 3",188
9680,"Under memory he considered history; under imagination, poetry, and art; and finally, under reason, philosophy97 According to his favourite method of division these again are further divided, since he brings all else under these same heads; this is, however, unsatisfactory
- HoP 3",280
9682,"Thus, in treating of Cosmetica, he says in regard to paint that “He is surprised that this depraved custom of painting has been by the penal laws both ecclesiastical and civil so long overlooked
- HoP 3",202
9683,"In the Bible we read indeed of Jezebel that she painted her face; but nothing of the kind is said of Esther or Judith”99 If kings, popes, etc, are being discussed, such examples as those of Ahab and Solomon must be brought forward
- HoP 3",238
9684,"As formerly in civil laws—those respecting marriage, for instance—the Jewish forms held good, in Philosophy, too, the same are still to be found
- HoP 3",152
9685,"In this work theology likewise appears, as also magic; there is contained in it a comprehensive system of knowledge and of the sciences
- HoP 3",143
9686,"The arrangement of the sciences is the least significant part of the work De augmentis scientiarum
- HoP 3",106
9688,"As it was with the Schoolmen and with the ancients, this classification is still the mode adopted in the sciences, in which the nature of knowledge is unknown
- HoP 3",166
9689,"In them the idea of the science is advanced beforehand, and to this idea a principle foreign to it is added, as a basis of division, just as here is added the distinction between memory, imagination and reason
- HoP 3",217
9690,"The true method of division is found in the self-division of the Notion, its separating itself from itself
- HoP 3",114
9691,"In knowledge the moment of self-consciousness is undoubtedly found, and the real self-consciousness has in it the moments of memory, imagination and reason
- HoP 3",163
9692,"But this division is certainly not taken from the Notion of self-consciousness, but from experience, in which self-consciousness finds itself possessed of these capacities
- HoP 3",179
9693,"The other remarkable feature in Bacon is that in his second work, his Organon, he sought at great length to establish a new method in learning; in this regard his name is still held greatly in honour by many
- HoP 3",215
9694,"What chiefly distinguishes his system is his polemical attitude towards scholastic methods as they had hitherto existed, towards syllogistic forms
- HoP 3",154
9695,"He calls these methods anticipationes naturæ; in them men begin with presuppositions, definitions, accepted ideas, with a scholastic abstraction, and reason further from these without regarding that which is present in actuality
- HoP 3",236
9696,"Thus regarding God and His methods of operating in nature, regarding devils, &c, they make use of passages from the Bible, such as “Sun, stand thou still,” in order to deduce therefrom certain metaphysical propositions from which they go further still
- HoP 3",259
9698,"For the sense in its primary objects at once apprehends the appearance of the object, and consents to the truth thereof”101 The syllogism is altogether rejected by Bacon
- HoP 3",177
9699,"As a matter of fact, this Aristotelian deduction is not a knowledge through itself in accordance with its content: it requires a foreign universal as its basis, and for that reason its movement is in its form contingent
- HoP 3",227
9700,"The content is not in unity with the form, and this form is hence in itself contingent, because it, considered on its own account, is the movement onwards in a foreign content
- HoP 3",183
9701,"The major premise is the content existent for itself, the minor is likewise the content not through itself, for it goes back into the infinite, ie it has not the form in itself; the form is not the content
- HoP 3",213
9702,"The opposite may always be made out equally well through the syllogism, for it is a matter of indifference to this form what content is made its basis
- HoP 3",158
9703,"He demanded that observations on nature and experiments should be made fundamental, and pointed out the objects whose investigation was of special importance in the interests of human society, and so on
- HoP 3",210
9704,"From this there then resulted the establishment of conclusions through induction and analogy103 In fact it was only to an alteration in the content that, without being aware of it, Bacon was impelled
- HoP 3",207
9706,"Thus when Bacon set up induction in opposition to the syllogism, this opposition is formal; each induction is also a deduction, which fact was known even to Aristotle
- HoP 3",174
9707,"For if a universal is deduced from a number of things, the first proposition reads, “These bodies have these qualities;” the second, “All these bodies belong to one class;” and thus, in the third place, this class has these qualities
- HoP 3",241
9708,"That is a perfect syllogism
- HoP 3",35
9709,"Induction always signifies that observations are instituted, experiments made, experience regarded, and from this the universal determination is derived
- HoP 3",160
9710,"We have already called to mind how important it is to lead on to the content as the content of actuality, of the present; for the rational must have objective truth
- HoP 3",172
9711,"The reconciliation of spirit with the world, the glorification of nature and of all actuality, must not be a Beyond, a Futurity, but must be accomplished now and here
- HoP 3",174
9712,"It is this moment of the now and here which thereby comes into self-consciousness
- HoP 3",89
9714,"The sensuous individual eludes the experiments even while it is being operated upon, and becomes a universal; the best known example of this is to be found in positive and negative electricity in so far as it is positive and negative
- HoP 3",241
9715,"There is another shortcoming of a formal nature, and one of which all empiricists partake,—that is that they believe themselves to be keeping to experience alone; it is to them an unknown fact that in receiving these perceptions they are indulging in metaphysics
- HoP 3",270
9716,"Man does not stop short at the individual, nor can he do so
- HoP 3",67
9717,"He seeks the universal, but thoughts, even if not Notions likewise, are what constitute the same
- HoP 3",104
9718,"The most remarkable thought-form is that of force; we thus speak of the force of electricity, of magnetism, of gravity
- HoP 3",126
9719,"Force, however, is a universal and not a perceptible; quite uncritically and unconsciously the empiricists thus permit of determinations such as these
- HoP 3",158
9720,"Bacon finally gives the objects with which Philosophy mainly has to deal
- HoP 3",80
9721,"These objects contrast much with that which we derive from perception and experience
- HoP 3",92
9723,"So again a man who knows well the nature of rarefaction, of assimilation, and of alimentation, shall by diets, bathings, and the like prolong life, or in some degree renew the vigour of youth”105 These assertions are thus not as crude as they at first appear
- HoP 3",266
9724,"In dealing with Medicine Bacon speaks amongst other things of maceration (Malacissatio per exterius)106 and so forth
- HoP 3",124
9725,"Bacon emphasizes what has reference to the formal aspect of investigation
- HoP 3",81
9726,"For he says, “Natural philosophy is divided into two parts, the first consists in the investigation of causes; the second in the production of effects; the causes to be investigated are either final or formal causes, or else material or efficient causes
- HoP 3",261
9727,"The former constitutes metaphysics; the latter physics
- HoP 3",62
9729,"And causes, again, are not improperly distributed into four kinds: the material, the formal, the efficient, and the final’”108 (Vol
- HoP 3",139
9730,"But in this connection an important point is that Bacon has turned against the teleological investigation of nature, against the investigation into final causes
- HoP 3",168
9732,"According to Bacon this has been worked out in innumerable different ways
- HoP 3",81
9733,"The negative and external side of utility is turned round, and the lack of this adaptation to end is likewise drawn within the same embrace
- HoP 3",147
9734,"It may, for example, be said that if sun or moon were to shine at all times, the police might save much money, and this would provide men with food and drink for whole months together
- HoP 3",191
9735,"It was right that Bacon should set himself to oppose this investigation into final causes, because it relates to external expediency, just as Kant was right in distinguishing the inward teleology from the outward
- HoP 3",220
9736,"As against the external end, there is, in fact, the inward end, ie the inward Notion of the thing itself, as we found it earlier in Aristotle (Vol
- HoP 3",154
9737,"Because the organism possesses an inward adaptation to its ends, its members are indeed likewise externally adapted as regards one another; but the ends, as external ends, are heterogeneous to the individual, are unconnected with the object which is investigated
- HoP 3",270
9738,"Speaking generally, the Notion of nature is not in nature itself, which would mean that the end was in nature itself; but as teleological, the Notion is something foreign to it
- HoP 3",184
9739,"It does not have the end in itself in such a way that we have to accord respect to it—as the individual man has his end in himself and hence has to be respected
- HoP 3",168
9740,"But even the individual man as individual has only a right to respect from the individual as such, and not from the universal
- HoP 3",133
9741,"He who acts in the name of the universal, of the state, as a general does for instance, does not require to respect the individual at all; for the latter, although an end in himself, does not cease to be relative
- HoP 3",220
9742,"He is this end in himself, not as excluding himself and setting himself in opposition, but only in so far as his true reality is the universal Notion
- HoP 3",157
9743,"The end of the animal in itself as an individual is its own self-preservation; but its true end in itself is the species
- HoP 3",128
9744,"Its self-preservation is not involved in this; for the self-preservation of its individuality is disadvantageous to the species, while the abrogation of itself is favourable thereto
- HoP 3",189
9745,"Now Bacon separates the universal principle and the efficient cause, and for that reason he removes investigation into ends from physics to metaphysics
- HoP 3",159
9749,"This polemic of Bacon’s against spectres, astrology, magic, &c,112 can certainly not be regarded exactly as Philosophy like his other reflections, but it is at least of service to culture
- HoP 3",195
9751,"The efficient and the material (as they are investigated and received, that is as remote causes, without reference to the latent process leading to the forms) are but slight and superficial, and contribute little, if anything, to true and active science
- HoP 3",261
9752,"For though in nature nothing really exists beside individual bodies, performing pure individual acts according to a fixed law, yet in philosophy this very law, and the investigation, discovery and explanation of it, is the foundation as well of knowledge as of operation
- HoP 3",278
9753,"And it is this law, with its clauses, that I mean when I speak of Forms Let the investigation of Forms which are eternal and immutable constitute metaphysics

9754,"The warmth of the sun and that of the fire are diverse
- HoP 3",62
9755,"We see that grapes ripen by the warmth of the sun
- HoP 3",57
9758,"The error of these last consisted alone in hoping to arrive at these ends by fabulous and fantastical methods;” the true method is to recognize these forms
- HoP 3",163
9759,"This is all that we have to say of Bacon
- HoP 3",48
9760,"In dealing with Locke we shall have more to say of these empirical methods which were adopted by the English
- HoP 3",116
9761,"We now pass on from this English Lord Chancellor, the leader of the external, sensuous method in Philosophy, to the philosophus teutonicus, as he is called—to the German cobbler of Lusatia, of whom we have no reason to be ashamed
- HoP 3",237
9762,"It was, in fact, through him that Philosophy first appeared in Germany with a character peculiar to itself: Boehme stands in exact antithesis to Bacon
- HoP 3",158
9764,"Leibnitz thought very highly of him, but it is in modern times that his profundity has for the first time been recognized, and that he has been once more restored to honour
- HoP 3",180
9765,"It is certain, on the one hand, that he did not merit the disdain accorded him; on the other, however, he did not deserve the high honour into which he was elevated
- HoP 3",172
9766,"To call him an enthusiast signifies nothing at all
- HoP 3",58
9769,"But it is only in the Notion, in thought, that Philosophy can find its truth, and that the Absolute can be expressed and likewise is as it is in itself
- HoP 3",159
9770,"Looked at from this point of view, Boehme is a complete barbarian, and yet he is a man who, along with his rude method of presentation, possesses a deep, concrete heart
- HoP 3",176
9771,"But because no method or order is to be found in him, it is difficult to give an account of his philosophy
- HoP 3",114
9772,"Jacob Boehme was born in 1575 of poor parents, at Altseidenburg, near Görlitz, in Upper Lusatia
- HoP 3",103
9773,"In his youth he was a peasant boy who tended the cattle
- HoP 3",63
9774,"He was brought up as a Lutheran, and always remained such
- HoP 3",65
9775,"The account of his life which is given with his works was drawn up by a clergyman who knew him personally, from information given by Boehme himself
- HoP 3",155
9776,"Much is there related as to how he attained to more profound knowledge and wisdom by means of certain experiences through which he passed
- HoP 3",145
9777,"Even when a herd tending the cattle, as he tells of himself, he had these wonderful manifestations
- HoP 3",106
9778,"The first marvellous awakening that occurred to him took place in a thicket in which he saw a cavern and a vessel of gold
- HoP 3",129
9779,"Startled by the splendour of this sight he was inwardly awakened from a dull stupor, but afterwards he found it was impossible for him to discover the objects of his vision
- HoP 3",180
9780,"Subsequently he was bound apprentice to a shoemaker
- HoP 3",59
9781,"More especially “was he spiritually awakened by the words: ‘Your heavenly Father will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him’ (Luke xi
- HoP 3",145
9783,"In 1594 he rose in his trade to be master, and married
- HoP 3",62
9784,"Later on, “in the year 1600, and in the twenty-fifth year of his age, once more” the light broke upon him in a second vision of the same kind
- HoP 3",149
9788,"His first writing is the “Aurora” or “Morgenröthe im Aufgange,” and this was followed by others; the work “Von den drei Principien,” and another “Vom dreifachen Leben des Menschen,” are, along with several others, the most noteworthy
- HoP 3",241
9789,"Boehme constantly read the Bible, but what other works he read is not known
- HoP 3",83
9794,"There is no systematic connection but the greatest confusion in his divisions—and this exists even in his tables,122 in which three numbers are made use of
- HoP 3",163
9795,"What God is beside nature and creation

9796,"Separability:       Mysterium          The first Principium
- HoP 3",67
9797,"God in wrath and love
- HoP 3",29
9798,"Here nothing definite to hold the moments asunder is shown, and we have the sense of merely doing it by effort; now these and now other distinctions are set forth, and as they are laid down disconnectedly, they again come into confusion
- HoP 3",244
9800,"For instance, sulphur and such like are not to him the things that we so name, but their essence; or the Notion has this form of actuality
- HoP 3",146
9801,"Boehme’s profoundest interest is in the Idea, and he struggles hard to express it
- HoP 3",89
9802,"The speculative truth which he desires to expound really requires, in order to be comprehended, thought and the form of thought
- HoP 3",135
9803,"Only in thought can this unity be comprehended, in the central point of which his mind has its place; but it is just the form of thought that is lacking to him
- HoP 3",167
9804,"The forms that he employs are really no longer determinations of the Notion at all
- HoP 3",90
9806,"It is, however, at once clear to us how the form of manifestation must necessarily appear forced, since thought alone is capable of unity
- HoP 3",145
9807,"It thus appears strange to read of the bitterness of God, of the Flagrat, and of lightning; we first require to have the Idea, and then we certainly discern its presence here
- HoP 3",182
9808,"But the other side is that Boehme utilizes the Christian form which lies nearest to him, and more especially that of the Trinity, as the form of the Idea: he intermingles the sensuous mode and the mode of popularly conceived religion, sensuous images and conceptions
- HoP 3",274
9810,"This solid, deep, German mind which has intercourse with what is most inward, thus really exercises an immense power and force in order to make use of actuality as Notion, and to have what takes place in heaven around and within it
- HoP 3",239
9811,"Just as Hans Sachs represented God, Christ and the Holy Ghost, as well as patriarchs and angels, in his own particular manner and as ordinary people like himself, not looking upon them as past and historic, so was it with Boehme
- HoP 3",236
9812,"To faith spirit has truth, but in this truth the moment of certainty of self is lacking
- HoP 3",95
9813,"We have seen that the object of Christianity is the truth, the Spirit; it is given to faith as immediate truth
- HoP 3",118
9814,"Faith possesses the truth, but unconsciously, without knowledge, without knowing it as its self-consciousness; and seeing that thought, the Notion, is necessarily in self-consciousness—the unity of opposites with Bruno—this unity is what is pre-eminently lacking to faith
- HoP 3",279
9815,"Its moments as particular forms fall apart, more especially the highest moments—good and evil, or God and the Devil
- HoP 3",123
9816,"God is, and the Devil likewise; both exist for themselves
- HoP 3",65
9820,"It requires a great and severe mental effort to bring together in one what in shape and form lie so far asunder; with all the strength that he possesses Boehme brings the two together, and therein shatters all the immediate significance of actuality possessed by both
- HoP 3",275
9821,"But when thus he grasps this movement, this essence of spirit in himself, in his inward nature, the determination of the moments simply approaches more nearly to the form of self-consciousness, to the formless, or to the Notion
- HoP 3",235
9822,"In the background, indeed, there stands the purest speculative thought, but it does not attain to an adequate representation
- HoP 3",132
9823,"Homely, popular modes of conception likewise appear, a free out-spokenness which to us seems too familiar
- HoP 3",113
9824,"With the devil, particularly, he has great dealings, and him he frequently addresses
- HoP 3",92
9826,"I shall shortly give Boehme’s main conceptions, and then several particular forms which he in turn adopts; for he does not remain at one form, because neither the sensuous nor the religious can suffice
- HoP 3",209
9828,"Hence we must neither expect to find in Boehme a systematic presentation nor a true method of passing over into the individual
- HoP 3",134
9829,"Of his thoughts we cannot say much without adopting his manner of expression, and quoting the particular passages themselves, for they cannot otherwise be expressed
- HoP 3",172
9830,"The fundamental idea in Jacob Boehme is the effort to comprise everything in an absolute unity, for he desires to demonstrate the absolute divine unity and the union of all opposites in God
- HoP 3",197
9833,"Sometimes the presentation is vague, and then again it is clearer
- HoP 3",73
9834,"What comes next is the explanation of this Trinity, and here the different forms which he uses to indicate the difference becoming evident in the same, more especially appear
- HoP 3",182
9835,"In the Aurora, the “Root or Mother of Philosophy, Astrology and Theology,” he gives a method of division in which he places these sciences in proximity, and yet appears merely to pass from one to the other without any clear definition or determination
- HoP 3",259
9836,"What comes first is God the Father; this first is at once divided in itself and the unity of both its parts
- HoP 3",115
9837,"There is an eternal Contrarium between darkness and light; neither comprehends the other and neither is the other, and yet there is but one essence or substance, though separated by pain; it is likewise so with the will, and yet there is no separable essence
- HoP 3",266
9839,"All Boehme’s efforts were directed towards this point; the principle of the Notion is living in him, only he cannot express it in the form of thought
- HoP 3",157
9840,"That is to say, all depends on thinking of the negative as simple, since it is at the same time an opposite; thus anguish Qual is the inward tearing asunder and yet likewise the simple
- HoP 3",192
9841,"From this Boehme derives sources or springs Quellen, a good play on the words
- HoP 3",85
9842,"For pain die Qual, this negativity, passes into life, activity, and thus he likewise connects it with quality Qualität, which he makes into Quallity128 The absolute identity of difference is all through present to him
- HoP 3",225
9843,"The first, the one, the Father, has likewise the mode of natural existence; thus, like Proclus, he speaks of this God being simple essence
- HoP 3",146
9844,"This simple essence he calls the hidden; and he therefore names it the Temperamentum, this unity of what is different, in which all is tempered
- HoP 3",151
9845,"We find him also calling it the great Salitter—now the divine and now the natural Salitter—as well as Salniter
- HoP 3",118
9846,"But it is a vulgar corruption of the word sal nitri, saltpetre (which is still called salniter in Austria), ie just the neutral and in truth universal existence
- HoP 3",168
9848,"This first substance contains all powers or qualities as not yet separated; thus this salitter likewise appears as the body of God, who embraces all qualities in Himself
- HoP 3",177
9850,"It contains likewise two other kinds in it, namely Light and Fierceness” (Negativity); “of which the light or the heart of the heat is in itself a pleasant, joyful glance or lustre, a power of life  and a source of the heavenly kingdom of joy
- HoP 3",250
9851,"For it makes all things in this world living and moving; all flesh, trees, leaves, and grass grow in this world, as in the power of the light, and have their light therein, viz in the good
- HoP 3",196
9852,"Again, it contains also a fierceness or wrath which burns, consumes and spoils
- HoP 3",86
9853,"This wrath or fierceness springs, drives, and elevates itself in the light, and makes the light movable
- HoP 3",111
9854,"It wrestles and fights together in its two-fold source
- HoP 3",62
9855,"The light subsists in God without heat, but it does not subsist so in nature
- HoP 3",84
9856,"For all qualities in nature are one in another, in the same manner as God is all

9866,"You must not conceive that in the Body of the stars is the whole triumphing Holy Trinity, God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

- HoP 3",51
9892,"This is the furthest point of thought reached by Jacob Boehme
- HoP 3",69
9893,"He represents this Fall of Lucifer as that the “Ichts,” ie self-knowledge, the “I” Ichheit (a word which we find used by him), the inward imagining of self, the inward fashioning of self (the being-for-self), is the fire which absorbs all things
- HoP 3",253
9894,"This is the negative side in the separator, the anguish; or it is the wrath of God
- HoP 3",90
9895,"This divine wrath is hell and the devil, who through himself imagines himself into himself

9896,"This is very bold and speculative; Boehme here seeks to show in God Himself the sources of the divine anger
- HoP 3",115
9897,"He also calls the will of the something “Ichts” self-hood; it is the passing over of the something “Ichts” into the nothing Nichts, the “I” imagining itself within itself

9899,"Before this it was the nonens which is itself positive, the darkness; but the true negativity is the “I” It is not anything bad because it is called the evil; it is in mind alone that evil exists, because it is conceived therein as it is in itself

9904,"And the light of such kindling through fire makes it joyous, for it is an anointment,” joy and loveliness “of painfulness”142  Boehme turns this round in many ways in order to grasp the something Ichts, the Separator, as it “rises”143 from the Father

9905,"The qualities rise in the great Salitter, stir, raise, and move rügen themselves

9907,"This light is Lucifer
- HoP 3",29
9908,"The Being-for-self, the self-perception, is by Boehme called the drawing together into a point

9924,"The will which has flowed out wills dissimilarity, so that it may be distinguished from similarity and be its own something—and that something may exist, that the eternal seeing may see and feel

9925,"And from the individual will arises the No, for it brings itself into ownness, ie receptivity of self

9937,"We see that the sensuous element thus pertains to this
- HoP 3",62
9938,"Boehme really has the idea that “God’s essence” (which has proceeded from the eternal deep as world) “is thus not something far away which possesses a particular position or place, for” essence, “the abyss of nature and creation, is God Himself

9939,"Thou must not think that in heaven there was some manner of Corpus”—the seven spirits generate this Corpus or heart—“which above all other things is called God
- HoP 3",167
9940,"No; but the whole divine power which itself is heaven and the heaven of all heavens, is so generated, and that is called God the Father; of whom all the holy angels are generated, in like manner also the spirit of all men

9947,"You say, there is but one Being in God, and that God has no Son

9950,"Therefore observe, in thy heart, in thy veins, and in thy brain, thou hast thy spirit; and all the powers which move in thy heart, in thy veins, and in thy brain, wherein thy life consists, signify God the Father

9952,"And both these are but one in the government of thy mind, viz thy spirit, which signifies God the Holy Ghost

9954,"Now observe: in either wood, stone, or herbs there are three things contained, neither can anything be generated or grow, if but one of the three should be left out

9956,"And thirdly there is in it a springing, flowing power, smell, or taste, which is the spirit of the thing whereby it grows and increases

- HoP 3",138
9959,"As showing his manner of apprehending natural things I shall give one more example of the manner in which, in the further working out of the existence of nature as a counterstroke to the divine knowledge, he makes use of what we call things as Notions (supra, p 192)

9970,"Boehme describes the opposition in creation in the following way
- HoP 3",72
9971,"If nature is the first efflux of the Separator, two kinds of life must yet be understood as in the counterstroke of the divine essence, beyond that temporal one there is an eternal, to which the divine understanding is given

9973,"In this centrum man has both lives in himself, he belongs to time and eternity
- HoP 3",86
9976,"Barbarism in the working out of his system can no more fail to be recognized than can the great depths into which he has plunged by the union of the most absolute opposites
- HoP 3",180
9977,"Boehme grasps the opposites in the crudest, harshest way, but he does not allow himself through their unworkableness to be prevented from asserting the unity
- HoP 3",165
9978,"This rude and barbarous depth which is devoid of Notion, is always a present, something which speaks from itself, which has and knows everything in itself

9979,"We have still to mention Boehme’s piety, the element of edification, the way in which the soul is guided in his writings
- HoP 3",128
9980,"This is in the highest degree deep and inward, and if one is familiar with his form these depths and this inwardness will be found
- HoP 3",138

9982,"Philosophy in its own proper soil separates itself entirely from the philosophizing theology, in accordance with its principle, and places it on quite another side
- HoP 3",171
9984,"It is specially characteristic of the German that the more servile he on the one hand is, the more uncontrolled is he on the other; restraint and want of restraint—originality, is the angel of darkness that buffets us
- HoP 3",225
9986,"Thus because the independently existent thought, this culminating point of inwardness, is now set forth and firmly grasped as such, the dead externality of authority is set aside and regarded as out of place
- HoP 3",215
9987,"It is only through my own free thought within that thought can however be recognized and ratified by me
- HoP 3",111
9988,"This likewise signifies that such free thought is the universal business of the world and of individuals; it is indeed the duty of every man, since everything is based upon it; thus what claims to rank as established in the world man must scrutinize in his own thoughts
- HoP 3",277
9989,"Philosophy is thus become a matter of universal interest, and one respecting which each can judge for himself; for everyone is a thinker from the beginning
- HoP 3",163
9990,"On account of this new beginning to Philosophy we find in the old histories of Philosophy of the seventeenth century—eg that of Stanley—the philosophy of the Greeks and Romans only, and Christianity forms the conclusion
- HoP 3",227
9991,"The idea was that neither in Christianity nor subsequently any philosophy was to be found, because there was no longer a necessity for it, seeing that the philosophic theology of the Middle Ages had not free, spontaneous thought as its principle (Vol
- HoP 3",258
9992,"But though it is true that this has now become the philosophic principle, we must not expect that it should be at once methodically developed out of thought
- HoP 3",164
9993,"The old assumption is made, that man only attains to the truth through reflection; this plainly is the principle
- HoP 3",120
9994,"But the determination and definition of God, the world of the manifold as it appears, is not yet revealed as necessarily proceeding from thought; for we have only reached the thought of a content which is given through ordinary conception, observation, and experience
- HoP 3",275
9998,"CHAPTER I  THE METAPHYSICS OF THE UNDERSTANDING   Metaphysics is what reaches after substance, and this implies that one unity, one thought is maintained in opposition to dualism, just as Being was amongst the ancients
- HoP 3",226
9999,"In metaphysics itself we have, however, the opposition between substantiality and individuality
- HoP 3",103
10000,"The second stage is found in Locke, who treats of the opposition itself inasmuch as he considers the metaphysical Idea of experience, that is the origin of thoughts and their justification, not yet entering on the question of whether they are absolutely true
- HoP 3",266
10001,"In the third place we have Leibnitz’s monad—the world viewed as a totality
- HoP 3",82
10002,"We here encounter the innate ideas of Descartes
- HoP 3",55
10003,"The philosophy of Spinoza, in the second place, is related to the philosophy of Descartes as its necessary development only; the method is an important part of it
- HoP 3",170
10004,"A method which stands alongside of Spinozism and which is also a perfected development of Cartesianism, is, in the third place, that by which Malebranche has represented this philosophy
- HoP 3",193
10005,"René Descartes is a bold spirit who re-commenced the whole subject from the very beginning and constituted afresh the ground-work on which Philosophy is based, and to which, after a thousand years had passed, it once more returned
- HoP 3",238
10007,"This simple thought appeared in the form of the determinate, clear understanding, and it cannot thus be called speculative thought or speculative reason
- HoP 3",160
10008,"There are fixed determinations from which Descartes proceeds, but only of thought; this is the method of his time
- HoP 3",121
10009,"What the French called exact science, science of the determinate understanding, made its appearance at this time
- HoP 3",120
10010,"Philosophy and exact science were not yet separated, and it was only later on that this separation first took place
- HoP 3",123
10011,"To come to the life of Descartes—he was born in 1596, at La Haye in Touraine, of an ancient and noble race
- HoP 3",114
10014,"He went as a young man of eighteen to Paris, and there lived in the great world
- HoP 3",87
10015,"But as he here found no satisfaction, he soon left society and returned to his studies
- HoP 3",94
10016,"He retired to a suburb of Paris and there occupied himself principally with mathematics, remaining quite concealed from all his former friends
- HoP 3",150
10017,"At last, after the lapse of two years, he was discovered by them, drawn forth from his retirement, and again introduced to the great world
- HoP 3",146
10018,"He now once more renounced the study of books and threw himself into the affairs of actual life
- HoP 3",103
10019,"Many have found learning unsatisfying; Descartes became a soldier—not because he found in the sciences too little, but because they were too much, too high for him
- HoP 3",171
10020,"Here in his winter quarters he studied diligently, and in Ulm, for instance, he made acquaintance with a citizen who was deeply versed in mathematics
- HoP 3",157
10022,"He was also in the battle at Prague in which Frederick the Elector-Palatine lost the Bohemian crown
- HoP 3",107
10023,"Yet since the sight of these wild scenes could not satisfy him, he gave up military service in 1621
- HoP 3",107
10024,"He made several other journeys through the rest of Germany, and then proceeded to Poland, Prussia, Switzerland, Italy and France
- HoP 3",136
10027,"Descartes sets to work in a quite simple and childlike manner, with a narration of his reflections as they came to him
- HoP 3",126
10028,"Professor Cousin of Paris has brought out a new edition of Descartes in eleven octavo volumes; the greater part consists of letters on natural phenomena
- HoP 3",160
10029,"Descartes gave a new impetus to mathematics as well as to philosophy
- HoP 3",76
10030,"Several important methods were discovered by him, upon which the most brilliant results in higher mathematics were afterwards built
- HoP 3",139
10031,"His method is even now an essential in mathematics, for Descartes is the inventor of analytic geometry, and consequently the first to point out the way in this field of science to modern mathematics
- HoP 3",206
10032,"He likewise cultivated physics, optics, and astronomy, and made the most important discoveries in these; we have not, however, to deal with such matters
- HoP 3",160
10033,"The application of metaphysics to ecclesiastical affairs, investigations, etc, has likewise no special interest for us
- HoP 3",126
10035,"Descartes started by saying that thought must necessarily commence from itself; all the philosophy which came before this, and specially what proceeded from the authority of the Church, was for ever after set aside
- HoP 3",222
10037,"In Descartes’ philosophy we have thus to distinguish what has, and what has not universal interest for us: the former is the process of his thoughts themselves, and the latter the mode in which these thoughts are presented and deduced
- HoP 3",242
10038,"Yet we must not consider the process as a method of consistent proof; it is indeed a deep and inward progress, but it comes to us in an ingenuous and naïve form
- HoP 3",168
10039,"In order to do justice to Descartes’ thoughts it is necessary for us to be assured of the necessity for his appearance; the spirit of his philosophy is simply knowledge as the unity of Thought and Being
- HoP 3",210
10040,"And yet on the whole there is little to say about his philosophy
- HoP 3",72
10041,"He thus makes the abolition of all determinations the first condition of Philosophy
- HoP 3",91
10042,"This first proposition has not, however, the same signification as Scepticism, which sets before it no other aim than doubt itself, and requires that we should remain in this indecision of mind, an indecision wherein mind finds its freedom
- HoP 3",247
10043,"It rather signifies that we should renounce all prepossessions—that is, all hypotheses which are accepted as true in their immediacy—and commence from thought, so that from it we should in the first place attain to some fixed and settled basis, and make a true beginning
- HoP 3",278
10045,"To him everything is unstable indeed, in so far as the Ego can abstract from it or can think, for pure thought is abstraction from everything
- HoP 3",149
10046,"But in consciousness the end is predominant, and it is to arrive at something fixed and objective—and not the moment of subjectivity, or the fact of being set forth, known and proved by me
- HoP 3",196
10047,"Yet this last comes along with the other, for it is from the starting point of my thought that I would attain my object; the impulse of freedom is thus likewise fundamental
- HoP 3",180
10048,"In the propositions in which Descartes gives in his own way the ground of this great and most important principle, there is found a naïve and empirical system of reasoning
- HoP 3",179
10049,"This is an example: “Because we were born as children, and formed all manner of judgments respecting sensuous things before we had the perfect use of our reason, we are through many preconceived ideas hindered from the knowledge of the truth
- HoP 3",249
10050,"From these we appear not to be able to free ourselves in any other way but by once in our lives striving to doubt that respecting which we have the very slightest suspicion of an uncertainty
- HoP 3",198
10051,"Indeed it is really desirable to hold as false everything in respect to which we have any doubt, so that we may find more clearly what is most certain and most knowable
- HoP 3",176
10052,"Yet this doubt has to be limited to the contemplation of the truth, for in the conduct of our life we are compelled to choose the probable, since there the opportunity for action would often pass away before we could solve our doubts
- HoP 3",241
10054,"But if we conceive ourselves not to derive our existence from God, but from some other source, perhaps from ourselves, we are all the more liable, in that we are thus imperfect, to err
- HoP 3",192
10056,"The so-called immediate intuition and inward revelation, which in modern times is so highly regarded, has its place here
- HoP 3",128
10057,"But because in the Cartesian form the principle of freedom as such is not brought into view, the grounds which are here advanced are for the most part popular
- HoP 3",166
10059,"But to Descartes nothing is true which does not possess an inward evidence in consciousness, or which reason does not recognize so clearly and conclusively that any doubt regarding it is absolutely impossible
- HoP 3",216
10060,"For it is contradictory to say that what thinks does not exist
- HoP 3",70
10061,"Hence the knowledge that ‘I think, therefore I am,’ is what we arrive at first of all, and it is the most certain fact that offers itself to everyone who follows after philosophy in an orderly fashion
- HoP 3",208
10062,"This is the best way of becoming acquainted with the nature of spirit and its diversity from body
- HoP 3",105
10064,"The second proposition of the Cartesian philosophy is hence the immediate certainty of thought
- HoP 3",102
10065,"Certainty is only knowledge as such in its pure form as self-relating, and this is thought; thus then the unwieldy understanding makes its way on to the necessity of thought
- HoP 3",181
10066,"Descartes begins, just as Fichte did later on, with the ‘I’ as indubitably certain; I know that something is presented in me
- HoP 3",132
10067,"By this Philosophy is at one stroke transplanted to quite another field and to quite another standpoint, namely to the sphere of subjectivity
- HoP 3",149
10068,"Presuppositions in religion are given up; proof alone is sought for, and not the absolute content which disappears before abstract infinite subjectivity
- HoP 3",160
10069,"There is in Descartes likewise a seething desire to speak from strong feeling, from the ordinary sensuous point of view, just as Bruno and so many others, each in his own fashion, express as individualities their particular conceptions of the world
- HoP 3",256
10070,"Thought is the entirely universal, but not merely because I can abstract, but because ‘I’ is thus simple, self-identical
- HoP 3",128
10071,"Thought consequently comes first; the next determination arrived at, in direct connection with it, is the determination of Being
- HoP 3",136
10072,"The ‘I think’ directly involves my Being; this, says Descartes, is the absolute basis of all Philosophy158 The determination of Being is in my ‘I’; this connection is itself the first matter
- HoP 3",198
10073,"Thought as Being and Being as thought—that is my certainty, ‘I’; in the celebrated Cogito, ergo sum we thus have Thought and Being inseparably bound together
- HoP 3",165
10074,"On the one hand this proposition is regarded as a syllogism: from thought Being is deduced
- HoP 3",98
10075,"Kant more especially has objected to this that Being is not contained in thinking, that it is different from thinking
- HoP 3",125
10076,"This is true, but they are still inseparable, or constitute an identity; their difference is not to the prejudice of their unity
- HoP 3",136
10077,"Yet this maxim of pure abstract certainty, the universal totality in which everything implicitly exists, is not proved;159 we must therefore not try to convert this proposition into a syllogism
- HoP 3",201
10078,"Descartes himself says: “There is no syllogism present at all
- HoP 3",69
10079,"For in order that there should be such, the major premise must have been ‘all that thinks exists’”—from which the subsumption would have followed in the minor premise, ‘now I am’ By this the immediacy which rests in the proposition, would be removed
- HoP 3",257
10080,"The ‘Therefore’ which binds the two sides together is not the ‘Therefore’ of a syllogism; the connection between Being and Thought is only immediately posited
- HoP 3",166
10081,"This certainty is thus the prius; all other propositions come later
- HoP 3",75
10082,"The thinking subject as the simple immediacy of being-at-home-with-me is the very same thing as what is called Being; and it is quite easy to perceive this identity
- HoP 3",172
10083,"As universal, thought is contained in all that is particular, and thus is pure relation to itself, pure oneness with itself
- HoP 3",131
10084,"Immediacy is, however, a one-sided determination; thought does not contain it alone, but also the determination to mediate itself with itself, and thereby—by the mediation being at the same time the abrogation of the mediation—it is immediacy
- HoP 3",250
10085,"In thought we thus have Being; Being is, however, a poor determination, it is the abstraction from the concrete of thought
- HoP 3",130
10086,"This identity of Being and Thought, which constitutes the most interesting idea of modern times, has not been further worked out by Descartes; he has relied on consciousness alone, and for the time being placed it in the fore-front
- HoP 3",239
10087,"For with Descartes the necessity to develop the differences from the ‘I think’ is not yet present; Fichte first applied himself to the deduction of all determinations from this culminating point of absolute certainty
- HoP 3",224
10088,"Other propositions have been set against that of Descartes
- HoP 3",66
10089,"Gassendi,161 for example, asks if we might not just as well say Ludificor, ergo sum: I am made a fool of by my consciousness, therefore I exist—or properly speaking, therefore I am made a fool of
- HoP 3",203
10090,"Descartes himself recognized that this objection merited consideration, but he here repels it, inasmuch as it is the ‘I’ alone and not the other content which has to be maintained
- HoP 3",187
10091,"Being alone is identical with pure thought, and not its content, be it what it may
- HoP 3",90
10092,"Descartes further says: “By thought I, however, understand all that takes place in us within our consciousness, in as far as we are conscious of it; thus will, conception, and even feeling are identical with thought
- HoP 3",223
10095,"In willing, seeing, hearing, &c, thought is likewise contained, it is absurd to suppose that the soul has thinking in one special pocket, and seeing, willing, &c, in others
- HoP 3",180
10096,"But if I say ‘I see,’ ‘I walk out,’ there is present on the one hand my consciousness ‘I,’ and consequently thought, on the other hand, however, there is present willing, seeing, hearing, walking, and thus a still further modification of the content
- HoP 3",257
10097,"Now because of this modification I cannot say ‘I walk, and therefore I am,’ for I can undoubtedly abstract from the modification, since it is no longer universal Thought
- HoP 3",177
10098,"Thus we must merely look at the pure consciousness contained in the concrete ‘I’ Only when I accentuate the fact that I am present there as thinking, is pure Being implied, for only with the universal is Being united
- HoP 3",224
10099,"If from the fact that I touch or see the earth I judge that it exists, I must more certainly judge from this that my thought exists
- HoP 3",139
10101,"For I cannot set aside the fact that I judge, even if I can abstract from that respecting which I judge
- HoP 3",111
10104,"But in reflecting whether such things really exist doubts arise”168 That there is such a thing as a triangle is indeed in this case by no means certain, since extension is not contained in the immediate certainty of myself
- HoP 3",230
10105,"The soul may exist without the bodily element, and this last without it, they are in reality different; one is conceivable without the other
- HoP 3",148
10106,"The soul thus does not think and know the other as clearly as the certainty of itself169  Now the truth of all knowledge rests on the proof of the existence of God
- HoP 3",171
10107,"The soul is an imperfect substance, but it has the Idea of an absolute perfect existence within itself; this perfection is not begotten in itself, just because it is an imperfect substance; this Idea is thus innate
- HoP 3",222
10109,"This unity rests in God, or is God Himself
- HoP 3",50
10111,"It has the characteristic that “In it we do not recognize existence as something merely possible and accidental, as we do the conceptions of other things which we perceive clearly, but as a really essential and eternal determination
- HoP 3",240
10113,"Thus we there have the unity of thought and Being, and the ontological proof of the existence of God; this we met with earlier (p 63, seq)
- HoP 3",146
10114,"The proof of the existence of God from the Idea of Him is in this wise: In this Notion existence is implied; and therefore it is true
- HoP 3",141
10118,"For there must at least be as much in the cause as in the effect” (ε) “The existence of God is known immediately”—a priori—“from the contemplation of His nature
- HoP 3",168
10119,"To say that anything is contained in the nature or in the Notion of a thing is tantamount to saying that it is true: existence is directly contained in the Notion of God
- HoP 3",177
10120,"Hence it is quite true to say of Him that existence pertains of necessity to Him
- HoP 3",88
10122,"The objective reality of a Notion demands a cause in which the same reality is not merely contained objectively” (as in the finite), “but formally” (freely, purely for itself, outside of us) “or eminenter” (as original)
- HoP 3",227
10123,"Now we should say we find this highest Idea in us
- HoP 3",57
10124,"If we then ask whether this Idea exists, why, this is the Idea, that existence is asserted with it
- HoP 3",106
10125,"To say that it is only a conception is to contradict the meaning of this conception
- HoP 3",91
10126,"In such a case it is not proved of this content in itself that it determines itself into this unity of thought and Being
- HoP 3",128
10127,"In the form of God no other conception is thus here given than that contained in Cogito, ergo sum, wherein Being and thought are inseparably bound up—though now in the form of a conception which I possess within me
- HoP 3",222
10128,"The whole content of this conception, the Almighty, All-wise, &c, are predicates which do not make their appearance until later; the content is simply the content of the Idea bound up with existence
- HoP 3",206
10130,"Descartes then proceeds: “Mind is the more convinced of this when it notices that it discovers within itself the conception of no other thing wherein existence is necessarily implied
- HoP 3",190
10131,"From this it will perceive that that idea of highest reality is not imagined by it, it is not chimerical, but a true and unalterable fact which cannot do otherwise than exist, seeing that existence is necessarily involved in it
- HoP 3",235
10133,"But how can one argue from finite things to the infinite?
- HoP 3",65
10135,"From Him we must thus in true science deduce all created things”174 With the proof of the existence of God the validity of and evidence for all truth in its origin is immediately established
- HoP 3",198
10136,"God as First Cause is Being-for-self, the reality which is not merely entity or existence in thought
- HoP 3",108
10137,"An existence such as this first cause (which is not what we know as a thing) rests in the Notion of the not-I, not of each determinate thing—since these as determinate are negations—but only in the Notion of pure existence or the perfect cause
- HoP 3",251
10138,"It is the cause of the truth of ideas, for the aspect that it represents is that of their Being
- HoP 3",103
10139,"It is not to be wondered at, since we are finite, that there is in God’s nature as inconceivably infinite, what passes our comprehension” This represents the entrance of a very ordinary conception
- HoP 3",204
10141,"From this Descartes goes on to infer the universal bond which exists between absolute knowledge and the objectivity of what we thus know
- HoP 3",144
10142,"Knowledge has objects, has a content which is known; we call this connection truth
- HoP 3",90
10143,"The truth of God is just this unity of what is thought by the subject or clearly perceived, and external reality or existence
- HoP 3",133
10144,"We can thus no longer have any suspicion of mathematical truths
- HoP 3",71
10147,"Descartes’ method is the method of the clear understanding merely
- HoP 3",73
10149,"In the first case the necessity of mediating them enters in, and the truth of God is asserted to be this mediating power
- HoP 3",128
10150,"It consists in this, that His Notion contains reality immediately in itself
- HoP 3",83
10151,"The proof of this unity then rests solely upon the fact of its being said that we find within us the idea of complete perfection; thus this conception here appears simply as one found ready to hand
- HoP 3",205
10152,"With this is compared the mere conception of God which contains no existence within it, and it is found that without existence it would be imperfect
- HoP 3",156
10153,"This unity of God Himself, of His Idea, with His existence, is undoubtedly the Truth; in this we find the ground for holding as true what is for us just as certain as the truth of ourselves
- HoP 3",197
10154,"As Descartes proceeds further we thus find that in reality everything has truth for him only in so far as it is really an object of thought, a universal
- HoP 3",160
10155,"This truth of God has been, as we shall see, expressed even more clearly and in a more concise way by a disciple of Descartes, if one may venture to call him so—I mean Malebranche (who might really be dealt with here),177 in his Recherche de la vérité
- HoP 3",259
10156,"The first of the fundamental determinations of the Cartesian metaphysics is from the certainty of oneself to arrive at the truth, to recognize Being in the Notion of thought
- HoP 3",181
10157,"But because in the thought “I think,” I am an individual, thought comes before my mind as subjective; Being is hence not demonstrated in the Notion of thought itself, for what advance has been made is merely in the direction of separation generally
- HoP 3",256
10158,"In the second place the negative of Being likewise comes before self-consciousness, and this negative, united with the positive I, is so to speak implicitly united in a third, in God
- HoP 3",190
10160,"An objection to this identity is now old—Kant urged it likewise—that from the Notion of the most perfect existence more does not follow than that in thought existence here and now and the most perfect essence are conjoined, but not outside of thought
- HoP 3",258
10161,"But the very Notion of present existence is this negative of self-consciousness, not out of thought,—but the thought of the ‘out of thought’  2
- HoP 3",151
10162,"Descartes accepts Being in the entirely positive sense, and has not the conception of its being the negative of self-consciousness: but simple Being, set forth as the negative of self-consciousness, is extension
- HoP 3",219
10164,"Descartes does not, however, trace extension in a true method back to thought; matter, extended substances, stand over against the thinking substances which are simple; in as far as the universe is created by God, it could not be as perfect as its cause
- HoP 3",261
10165,"As a matter of fact the effect is less perfect than the cause, since it is that which is posited, if we are to remain at the conception of cause pertaining to the understanding
- HoP 3",184
10166,"Hence according to Descartes extension is the less perfect
- HoP 3",66
10167,"But as imperfect the extended substances cannot exist and subsist through themselves or their Notion; they thus require every moment the assistance of God for their maintenance, and without this they would in a moment sink back into nothing
- HoP 3",248
10169,"He calls those last something inborn within us, something not made by us or merely felt,179 but the eternal Notion of mind itself and the eternal determinations of its freedom, of itself as itself
- HoP 3",204
10170,"From this point the conception that ideas are inborn (innatæ ideæ) hence proceeds; this is the question over which Locke and Leibnitz dispute
- HoP 3",149
10171,"The expression “eternal truths” is current even in these modern times, and it signifies the universal determinations and relations which exist entirely on their own account
- HoP 3",180
10172,"The word ‘inborn’ is however a clumsy and stupid expression, because the conception of physical birth thereby indicated, does not apply to mind
- HoP 3",151
10174,"We would rather say that such is implied in the nature and essence of our mind and spirit
- HoP 3",97
10175,"Mind is active and conducts itself in its activity in a determinate manner; but this activity has no other ground than its freedom
- HoP 3",138
10176,"Yet if this is the case more is required than merely to say so; it must be deduced as a necessary product of our mind
- HoP 3",125
10177,"We have such ideas, for instance, in the logical laws: “From nothing comes nothing,” “A thing cannot both be and not be,”180 as also in moral principles
- HoP 3",160
10178,"These are facts of consciousness which Descartes however soon passes from again; they are only present in thought as subjective, and he has thus not yet inquired respecting their content
- HoP 3",194
10180,"But although Descartes laid it down formerly as essential that no hypotheses must be made, yet now he takes the conceptions, and passes on to them as something found within our consciousness
- HoP 3",198
10182,"That is then called the system of assistance (systema assistentiæ) which is, however, transcendental
- HoP 3",108
10183,"God is the absolute uniter of Notion and actuality; other things, finite things which have a limit and stand in dependence, require something else
- HoP 3",154
10184,"This is the real distinction (distinctio realis) of substances: “The one substance can be clearly and definitely comprehended without the other
- HoP 3",151
10186,"But extended substance, the kingdom of nature, and spiritual substance, do not require one another183 They may be called substances, because each of them constitutes an entire range or sphere, an independent totality
- HoP 3",224
10188,"Descartes proceeds from the Notion of God to what is created, to thought and extension, and from this to the particular
- HoP 3",127
10189,"Thus thought constitutes the absolute attribute of mind,” thought is its quality; “extension is” the essential determination of corporeality, and this alone is “the true nature of body
- HoP 3",192
10190,"God is the uncreated, thinking substance”184  Descartes here passes to what is individual, and because he follows up extension he arrives at matter, rest, movement
- HoP 3",171
10191,"One of Descartes’ main points is that matter, extension, corporeality, are quite the same thing for thought; according to him the nature of body is fulfilled in its extension, and this should be accepted as the only essential fact respecting the corporeal world
- HoP 3",269
10192,"We say that body offers resistance, has smell, taste, colour, transparency, hardness, &c, since without these we can have no body
- HoP 3",137
10193,"All these further determinations respecting what is extended, such as size, rest, movement, and inertia, are, however, merely sensuous, and this Descartes showed, as it had long before this been shown by the Sceptics
- HoP 3",224
10194,"Undoubtedly that is the abstract Notion or pure essence, but to body or to pure existence, there likewise of necessity pertains negativity or diversity
- HoP 3",159
10195,"By means of the following illustration Descartes showed that with the exception of extension, all corporeal determinations may be annihilated, and that none can be absolutely predicated
- HoP 3",193
10196,"Now if we admit that matter as we touch it always gives way to us like space, we should have no reason for ascribing to it solidity
- HoP 3",139
10197,"Smell, colour, taste, are in the same way sensuous qualities merely; but what we clearly perceive is alone true
- HoP 3",119
10198,"If a body is ground into small parts, it gives way, and yet it does not lose its nature; resistance is thus not essential185 This not-being-for-itself is however a quantitatively slighter resistance only; the resistance always remains
- HoP 3",242
10199,"But Descartes desires only to think; now he does not think resistance, colour, &c, but apprehends them by the senses only
- HoP 3",129
10200,"Hence he says that all this must be led back to extension as being special modifications of the same
- HoP 3",108
10203,"Extension and motion are the fundamental conceptions in mechanical physics; they represent the truth of the corporeal world
- HoP 3",131
10204,"It is thus that ideality comes before the mind of Descartes, and he is far elevated above the reality of the sensuous qualities, although he does not reach so far as to the separation of this ideality
- HoP 3",208
10205,"He thus remains at the point of view of mechanism pure and simple
- HoP 3",73
10206,"Give me matter (extension) and motion and I will build worlds for you, is what Descartes virtually says187 Space and time were hence to him the only determinations of the material universe
- HoP 3",196
10208,"In living beings processes such as that of digestion are mechanical effects which have as principles, rest and movement
- HoP 3",127
10209,"We here see the ground and origin of the mechanical philosophy; but further on we find that this is unsatisfactory, for matter and motion do not suffice to explain life
- HoP 3",176
10210,"Yet the great matter in all this is that thought goes forward in its determinations, and that it constitutes from these thought-determinations the truth of nature
- HoP 3",170
10211,"In his consideration of the system of the world and the movement of the heavenly bodies, Descartes has worked out the mechanical view more fully
- HoP 3",152
10213,"Descartes thus mingles many observations with a metaphysic of this nature, and to us the result is hence obscure
- HoP 3",120
10214,"In this philosophy the thinking treatment of empiricism is thus predominant, and a similar method has been adopted by philosophers from this time on
- HoP 3",156
10215,"To Descartes and others, Philosophy had still the more indefinite significance of arriving at knowledge through thought, reflection, and reasoning
- HoP 3",154
10216,"Speculative cognition, the derivation from the Notion, the free independent development of the matter itself, was first introduced by Fichte, and consequently what is now called philosophic knowledge is not yet separated in Descartes from the rest of scientific knowledge
- HoP 3",279
10218,"The strictly scientific element here really consisted mainly in the method of proof as it has long been made use of in geometry, and in the ordinary method of the formal logical syllogism
- HoP 3",195
10220,"And this is the case with Descartes
- HoP 3",43
10221,"The first part of the Principia philosophiæ treats De principiis cognitionis humanæ, the second De principiis rerum materialium
- HoP 3",135
10223,"Descartes never reached the third part, the philosophy of Mind, for, while he made a special study of physics, in the region of ethics he published one tract only, De passionibus
- HoP 3",186
10224,"In this reference Descartes treats of thought and human freedom
- HoP 3",71
10225,"He proves freedom from the fact of the soul thinking that the will is unrestrained, and of that constituting the perfection of mankind
- HoP 3",142
10226,"And this is quite true
- HoP 3",30
10227,"In respect to the freedom of the will he comes across the difficulty of how to reconcile it with the divine prescience
- HoP 3",126
10228,"As free, man might do what is not ordained of God beforehand—this would conflict with the omnipotence and omniscience of God; and if everything is ordained of God, human freedom would thereby be done away with
- HoP 3",217
10229,"Yet he does not solve the contradiction contained in these two different aspects without falling into difficulty
- HoP 3",120
10230,"But conformably to the method which he adopts, and which we pointed out above (pp
- HoP 3",89
10231,"The method of knowledge as set forth by Descartes, takes the form of a reasoning of the understanding, and is thus without special interest
- HoP 3",147
10232,"These, then, are the principal points in the Cartesian system
- HoP 3",69
10234,"In the sharp opposition between thought and extension, the former is not considered as sensation, so that the latter can isolate itself
- HoP 3",143
10235,"The organic must as body reduce itself to extension; any further development of this last thus only proves its dependence on the first determinations
- HoP 3",157
10236,"In the second place, the relation between soul and body now becomes an important question, that is, the return of the object within itself in such a way that thought posits itself in another, in matter
- HoP 3",209
10237,"As to this, many systems are offered to us in metaphysics
- HoP 3",65
10238,"One of these is the influxus physicus, that the relation of spirit is of a corporeal nature, that the object is related to mind as bodies are to one another—a conception like this is very crude
- HoP 3",201
10239,"How does Descartes understand the unity of soul and body?
- HoP 3",65
10240,"The former belongs to thought, the latter to extension; and thus because both are substance, neither requires the Notion of the other, and hence soul and body are independent of one another and can exercise no direct influence upon one another
- HoP 3",251
10241,"Soul could only influence body in so far as it required the same, and conversely—that is, in so far as they have actual relation to one another
- HoP 3",151
10242,"But since each is a totality, neither can bear a real relation to the other
- HoP 3",83
10243,"Descartes consistently denied the physical influence of one on the other; that would have signified a mechanical relation between the two
- HoP 3",145
10244,"Descartes thus established the intellectual sphere in contradistinction to matter, and on it based the independent subsistence of mind; for in his cogito ‘I’ is at first only certain of itself, since I can abstract from all
- HoP 3",231
10245,"Now we find the necessity of a mediator to bring about a union of the abstract and the external and individual
- HoP 3",118
10246,"Descartes settles this by placing between the two what constitutes the metaphysical ground of their mutual changes, God
- HoP 3",127
10248,"For above (p 239) we saw that Descartes says of God that He is the Truth of the conception: as long as I think rightly and consistently, something real corresponds to my thought, and the connecting link is God
- HoP 3",217
10249,"God is hereby the perfect identity of the two opposites, since He is, as Idea, the unity of Notion and reality
- HoP 3",118
10250,"In the Idea of Spinoza this is worked out and developed in its further moments
- HoP 3",86
10251,"Descartes’ conclusion is quite correct; in finite things this identity is imperfect
- HoP 3",91
10252,"Only the form employed by Descartes is inadequate; for it implies that in the beginning there are two things, thought or soul and body, and that then God appears as a third thing, outside both—that He is not the Notion of unity, nor are the two elements themselves Notion
- HoP 3",279
10253,"We must not however forget that Descartes says that both those original elements are created substances
- HoP 3",111
10254,"But this expression ‘created’ pertains to the ordinary conception only and is not a determinate thought; it was Spinoza, therefore, who first accomplished this return to thought
- HoP 3",185
10255,"The philosophy of Descartes underwent a great variety of unspeculative developments, but in Benedict Spinoza a direct successor to this philosopher may be found, and one who carried on the Cartesian principle to its furthest logical conclusions
- HoP 3",252
10256,"For him soul and body, thought and Being, cease to have separate independent existence
- HoP 3",94
10257,"The dualism of the Cartesian system Spinoza, as a Jew, altogether set aside
- HoP 3",83
10258,"For the profound unity of his philosophy as it found expression in Europe, his manifestation of Spirit as the identity of the finite and the infinite in God, instead of God’s appearing related to these as a Third—all this is an echo from Eastern lands
- HoP 3",259
10259,"The Oriental theory of absolute identity was brought by Spinoza much more directly into line, firstly with the current of European thought, and then with the European and Cartesian philosophy, in which it soon found a place
- HoP 3",231
10260,"First of all we must, however, glance at the circumstances of Spinoza’s life
- HoP 3",84
10261,"He was by descent a Portuguese Jew, and was born at Amsterdam in the year 1632; the name he received was Baruch, but he altered it to Benedict
- HoP 3",150
10262,"In his youth he was instructed by the Rabbis of the synagogue to which he belonged, but he soon fell out with them, their wrath having been kindled by the criticisms which he passed on the fantastic doctrines of the Talmud
- HoP 3",230
10263,"He was not, therefore, long in absenting himself from the synagogue, and as the Rabbis were in dread lest his example should have evil consequences, they offered him a yearly allowance of a thousand gulden if he would keep away from the place and hold his tongue
- HoP 3",270
10264,"This offer he declined; and the Rabbis thereafter carried their persecution of him to such a pitch that they were even minded to rid themselves of him by assassination
- HoP 3",175
10265,"After having made a narrow escape from the dagger, he formally withdrew from the Jewish communion, without, however, going over to the Christian Church
- HoP 3",159
10266,"He now applied himself particularly to the Latin language, and made a special study of the Cartesian philosophy
- HoP 3",119
10267,"Later on he went to Rhynsburg, near Leyden, and from the year 1664 he lived in retirement, first at Voorburg, a village near the Hague, and then at the Hague itself, highly respected by numerous friends: he gained a livelihood for himself by grinding optical glasses
- HoP 3",274
10268,"It was no arbitrary choice that led him to occupy himself with light, for it represents in the material sphere the absolute identity which forms the foundation of the Oriental view of things
- HoP 3",198
10269,"Although he had rich friends and mighty protectors, among whom even generals were numbered, he lived in humble poverty, declining the handsome gifts offered to him time after time
- HoP 3",187
10270,"Nor would he permit Simon von Vries to make him his heir; he only accepted from him an annual pension of three hundred florins; in the same way he gave up to his sisters his share of their father’s estate
- HoP 3",212
10272,"Spinoza died on the 21st of February, 1677, in the forty-fourth year of his age
- HoP 3",87
10273,"The cause of his death was consumption, from which he had long been a sufferer; this was in harmony with his system of philosophy, according to which all particularity and individuality pass away in the one substance
- HoP 3",224
10277,"For we find the first of Spinoza’s works entitled “An Exposition according to the geometrical method of the principles of the Cartesian philosophy” Some time after this he wrote his Tractatus theologico-politicus, and by it gained considerable reputation
- HoP 3",262
10278,"Great as was the hatred which Spinoza roused amongst his Rabbis, it was more than equalled by the odium which he brought upon himself amongst Christian, and especially amongst Protestant theologians—chiefly through the medium of this essay
- HoP 3",247
10279,"It contains his views on inspiration, a critical treatment of the books of Moses and the like, chiefly from the point of view that the laws therein contained are limited in their application to the Jews
- HoP 3",210
10281,"All this, however, is already to be found in the above-mentioned work of Spinoza
- HoP 3",88
10282,"But Spinoza drew the greatest odium upon himself by his philosophy proper, which we must now consider as it is given to us in his Ethics
- HoP 3",144
10283,"It consists of five parts; the first deals with God (De Deo)
- HoP 3",68
10284,"General metaphysical ideas are contained in it, which include the knowledge of God and nature
- HoP 3",101
10285,"The second part deals with the nature and origin of mind (De natura et origine mentis)
- HoP 3",94
10288,"Spinoza’s system is that of Descartes made objective in the form of absolute truth
- HoP 3",90
10289,"The simple thought of Spinoza’s idealism is this: The true is simply and solely the one substance, whose attributes are thought and extension or nature: and only this absolute unity is reality, it alone is God
- HoP 3",217
10290,"It is, as with Descartes, the unity of thought and Being, or that which contains the Notion of its existence in itself
- HoP 3",126
10291,"The Cartesian substance, as Idea, has certainly Being included in its Notion; but it is only Being as abstract, not as real Being or as extension (supra, p 241)
- HoP 3",168
10292,"This expression signifies that Being must be grasped as the unity of opposites; the chief consideration is not to let slip the opposition and set it aside, but to reconcile and resolve it
- HoP 3",195
10294,"The pure thought of Spinoza is therefore not the simple universal of Plato, for it has likewise come to know the absolute opposition of Notion and Being
- HoP 3",160
10295,"Taken as a whole, this constitutes the Idea of Spinoza, and it is just what τὸ ὄν was to the Eleatics (Vol
- HoP 3",114
10298,"It is therefore worthy of note that thought must begin by placing itself at the standpoint of Spinozism; to be a follower of Spinoza is the essential commencement of all Philosophy
- HoP 3",188
10300,"The difference between our standpoint and that of the Eleatic philosophy is only this, that through the agency of Christianity concrete individuality is in the modern world present throughout in spirit
- HoP 3",209
10301,"But in spite of the infinite demands on the part of the concrete, substance with Spinoza is not yet determined as in itself concrete
- HoP 3",140
10302,"As the concrete is thus not present in the content of substance, it is therefore to be found within reflecting thought alone, and it is only from the endless oppositions of this last that the required unity emerges
- HoP 3",222
10303,"Of substance as such there is nothing more to be said; all that we can do is to speak of the different ways in which Philosophy has dealt with it, and the opposites which in it are abrogated
- HoP 3",198
10304,"The difference depends on the nature of the opposites which are held to be abrogated in substance
- HoP 3",105
10306,"Spinoza begins (Eth
- HoP 3",27
10308,"The establishing of itself as an other is loss or degeneration, and at the same time the negation of this loss; this is a purely speculative Notion, indeed a fundamental Notion in all speculation
- HoP 3",203
10309,"The cause in which the cause is identical with the effect, is the infinite cause (infra, p 263); if Spinoza had further developed what lies in the causa sui, substance with him would not have been rigid and unworkable
- HoP 3",225
10310,"The second definition is that of the finite
- HoP 3",51
10312,"That is the affirmative side of the limit
- HoP 3",49
10313,"What cannot have a conception formed of it without the aid of something else, is not independent, but is dependent upon that something else
- HoP 3",147
10314,"This is an important determination; the attribute is undoubtedly a determinateness, but at the same time it remains a totality
- HoP 3",134
10315,"Spinoza, like Descartes, accepts only two attributes, thought and extension
- HoP 3",83
10316,"The understanding grasps them as the reality of substance, but the reality is not higher than the substance, for it is only reality in the view of the understanding, which falls outside substance
- HoP 3",203
10317,"Each of the two ways of regarding substance—extension and thought—contains no doubt the whole content of substance, but only in one form, which the understanding brings with it; and for this very reason both sides are in themselves identical and infinite
- HoP 3",262
10318,"This is the true completion; but where substance passes over into attribute is not stated
- HoP 3",97
10319,"These last three moments Spinoza ought not merely to have established in this way as conceptions, he ought to have deduced them; they are especially important, and correspond with what we more definitely distinguish as universal, particular and individual
- HoP 3",263
10321,"The mode is the individual, the finite as such, which enters into external connection with what is “other” In this Spinoza only descends to a lower stage, the mode is only the foregoing warped and stunted

10322,"Spinoza’s defect is therefore this, that he takes the third moment as mode alone, as a false individuality
- HoP 3",114
10323,"True individuality and subjectivity is not a mere retreat from the universal, not merely something clearly determinate; for, as clearly determinate, it is at the same time Being-for-itself, determined by itself alone
- HoP 3",224
10324,"The individual, the subjective, is even in being so the return to the universal; and in that it is at home with itself, it is itself the universal
- HoP 3",154
10325,"The return consists simply and solely in the fact of the particular being in itself the universal; to this return Spinoza did not attain
- HoP 3",144
10326,"Rigid substantiality is the last point he reached, not infinite form; this he knew not, and thus determinateness continually vanishes from his thought
- HoP 3",158
10327,"The infinite has a double significance, according as it is taken as the infinitely many or as the absolutely infinite (infra, p 263)
- HoP 3",140
10328,"Most men, when they wish to strive after the sublime, get no farther than the first of these; this is the false infinite, just as when one says “and so on into infinity,” meaning perhaps the infinity of space from star to star, or else the infinity of time
- HoP 3",264
10329,"An infinite numerical series in mathematics is exactly the same thing
- HoP 3",77
10330,"If a certain fraction is represented as a decimal fraction, it is incomplete; ⅐ is, on the contrary, the true infinite, and therefore not an incomplete expression, although the content here is of course limited
- HoP 3",218
10331,"It is infinity in the incorrect sense that one usually has in view when infinity is spoken of; and even if it is looked on as sublime, it yet is nothing present, and only goes ever out into the negative, without being actual (actu)
- HoP 3",239
10332,"But for Spinoza the infinite is not the fixing of a limit and then passing beyond the limit fixed—the sensuous infinity—but absolute infinity, the positive, which has complete and present in itself an absolute multiplicity which has no Beyond
- HoP 3",250
10333,"Philosophic infinity, that which is infinite actu, Spinoza therefore calls the absolute affirmation of itself
- HoP 3",117
10334,"This is quite correct, only it might have been better expressed as: “It is the negation of negation” Spinoza here also employs geometrical figures as illustrations of the Notion of infinity
- HoP 3",197
10335,"In his Opera postuma, preceding his Ethics, and also in the letter quoted above, he has two circles, one of which lies within the other, which have not, however, a common centre
- HoP 3",185
10336,"Illustration  “The inequalities of the space between A B and C D exceed every number; and yet the space which lies between is not so very great” That is to say, if I wish to determine them all, I must enter upon an infinite series
- HoP 3",238
10337,"This “beyond” always, however, remains defective, is always affected with negation; and yet this false infinite is there to hand, circumscribed, affirmative, actual and present in that plane as a complete space between the two circles
- HoP 3",242
10338,"Or a finite line consists of an infinite number of points; and yet the line is present here and determined; the “beyond” of the infinite number of points, which are not complete, is in it complete and called back into unity
- HoP 3",231
10339,"The infinite should be represented as actually present, and this comes to pass in the Notion of the cause of itself, which is therefore the true infinity
- HoP 3",161
10340,"As soon as the cause has something else opposed to it—the effect—finitude is present; but here this something else is at the same time abrogated and it becomes once more the cause itself
- HoP 3",194
10341,"The affirmative is thus negation of negation, since, according to the well-known grammatical rule, duplex negatio affirmat
- HoP 3",130
10342,"In the same way Spinoza’s earlier definitions have also the infinite already implied in them, for instance in the case of the just mentioned cause of itself, inasmuch as he defines it as that whose essence involves existence (supra, p 258)
- HoP 3",247
10343,"Notion and existence are each the Beyond of the other; but cause of itself, as thus including them, is really the carrying back of this “beyond” into unity
- HoP 3",163
10344,"Or (supra, p 259) “Substance is that which is in itself and is conceived from itself;” that is the same unity of Notion and existence
- HoP 3",141
10345,"The infinite is in the same way in itself and has also its Notion in itself; its Notion is its Being, and its Being its Notion; true infinity is therefore to be found in Spinoza
- HoP 3",185
10346,"But he has no consciousness of this; he has not recognized this Notion as absolute Notion, and therefore has not expressed it as a moment of true existence; for with him the Notion falls outside of existence, into the thought of existence
- HoP 3",246
10347,"But as with Spinoza there are only two attributes, thought and extension, with which he invests God, “infinite” is not to be taken here in the sense of the indeterminate many, but positively, as a circle is perfect infinity in itself
- HoP 3",241
10348,"The whole of Spinoza’s philosophy is contained in these definitions, which, however, taken as a whole are formal; it is really a weak point in Spinoza that he begins thus with definitions
- HoP 3",195
10349,"In mathematics this method is permitted, because at the outset we there make assumptions, such as that of the point and line; but in Philosophy the content should be known as the absolutely true
- HoP 3",202
10350,"It is all very well to grant the correctness of the name-definition, and acknowledge that the word “substance” corresponds with the conception which the definition indicates, but it is quite another question to determine whether this content is absolutely true
- HoP 3",268
10351,"Such a question is not asked in the case of geometrical propositions, but in philosophic investigation it is the very thing to be first considered, and this Spinoza has not done
- HoP 3",185
10352,"Instead of only explaining these simple thoughts and representing them as concrete in the definitions which he makes, what he ought to have done was to examine whether this content is true
- HoP 3",196
10353,"To all appearance it is only the explanation of the words that is given; but the content of the words is held to be established
- HoP 3",135
10354,"All further content is merely derived from that, and proved thereby; for on the first content all the rest depends, and if it is established as a basis, the other necessarily follows
- HoP 3",190
10355,"Thus everything proceeds inwards, and not outwards; the determinations are not developed from substance, it does not resolve itself into these attributes
- HoP 3",161
10356,"These definitions are followed by axioms and propositions in which Spinoza proves a great variety of points
- HoP 3",115
10357,"He descends from the universal of substance through the particular, thought and extension, to the individual
- HoP 3",116
10358,"He has thus all three moments of the Notion, or they are essential to him
- HoP 3",81
10359,"But the mode, under which head falls individuality, he does not recognize as essential, or as constituting a moment of true existence in that existence; for it disappears in existence, or it is not raised into the Notion
- HoP 3",228
10360,"The main point then is that Spinoza proves from these Notions that there is only One Substance, God
- HoP 3",107
10361,"It is a simple chain of reasoning, a very formal proof
- HoP 3",62
10363,"For if the parts retained the nature of the substance, there would be several substances of the same nature, which is contrary to the fifth proposition
- HoP 3",159
10364,"If not, infinite substance would cease to exist, which is absurd”195  “Fourteenth Proposition: No other substance than God can either exist or be conceived
- HoP 3",163
10366,"Or if it were still to be substance, “then there would necessarily follow the possibility of there being two substances with the same attribute, which according to the fifth proposition is absurd
- HoP 3",203
10367,"From this it then follows that the thing extended and the thing that thinks” are not substances, but “are either attributes of God, or affections of His attributes” By these proofs and others like them not much is to be gained
- HoP 3",234
10368,"God is therefore the absolute First Cause”196  Spinoza then ascribes freedom and necessity to God: “God is the absolute free cause, who is determined by nothing outside of Himself, for He exists solely by the necessity of His nature
- HoP 3",240
10369,"There is no cause which inwardly or outwardly moves Him to act, except the perfection of His nature
- HoP 3",107
10371,"God has not therefore any other thoughts which He could not have actualized
- HoP 3",83
10372,"A thing which is determined to perform some action, is, since God is cause, necessarily determined thereto by God; and a thing which is thus determined cannot render itself undetermined
- HoP 3",193
10373,"In nature nothing is contingent
- HoP 3",39
10374,"Will is not a free cause, but only a necessary cause, only a mode; it is therefore determined by another
- HoP 3",112
10375,"God acts in accordance with no final causes (sub ratione boni)
- HoP 3",70
10376,"Those who assert that He does so, appear to establish something apart from God, which does not depend on God, and which God in His working keeps in view, as though it were an end
- HoP 3",186
10377,"If this view is taken, God is not a free cause, but is subject to fate
- HoP 3",78
10378,"It is equally inadmissible to subject all things to the arbitrary pleasure of God, ie, to His indifferent will”197 He is determined solely by His own nature; the activity of God is thus His power, and that is necessity
- HoP 3",226
10379,"He is then absolute power in contrast to wisdom, which sets up definite aims, and consequently limitations; particular aims, thoughts of what is about to come to pass, and the like are therefore put out of the question
- HoP 3",226
10380,"But beyond this universal, no advance is made; for it must be noticed as specially singular, that Spinoza in the fiftieth Letter (Oper
- HoP 3",142
10381,"T I p 634) says that every determination is a negation
- HoP 3",62
10382,"Moreover, if God is the cause of the world, it is implied that He is finite; for the world is here put beside God as something different from Him
- HoP 3",153
10383,"The greatest difficulty in Spinoza is, in the distinctions to which he comes, to grasp the relation of this determinate to God, at the same time preserving the determination
- HoP 3",181
10384,"God is an extended Being for the same reason” This means that the same substance, under the attribute of thought, is the intelligible world, and under the attribute of extension, is nature; nature and thought thus both express the same Essence of God
- HoP 3",258
10385,"Or, as Spinoza says, “The order and system of natural things is the same as the order of the thoughts
- HoP 3",109
10386,"Thus, for instance, the circle which exists in nature, and the idea of the existing circle, which is also in God, are one and the same thing” (they are one and the same content), “which is” merely “expressed by means of different attributes
- HoP 3",248
10387,"If we therefore regard nature either under the attribute of extension or of thought, or under any other attribute whatever, we shall find one and the same connection of causes, ie, the same sequence of things
- HoP 3",216
10389,"But Spinoza does not demonstrate how these two are evolved from the one substance, nor does he prove why there can only be two of them
- HoP 3",142
10390,"Neither are extension and thought anything to him in themselves, or in truth, but only externally; for their difference is a mere matter of the understanding, which is ranked by Spinoza only among affections (Eth
- HoP 3",220
10392,"The differences are not in themselves, but the different aspects from which the Absolute is regarded are matters external to it
- HoP 3",135
10393,"Again, it is the standpoint of reflection to regard aspects only, and nothing in itself
- HoP 3",95
10395,"Absolute substance, attribute and mode, Spinoza allows to follow one another as definitions, he adopts them ready-made, without the attributes being developed from the substance, or the modes from the attributes
- HoP 3",219
10396,"And more especially in regard to the attributes, there is no necessity evident, why these are thought and extension in particular
- HoP 3",137
10397,"Thus we already found the attributes not to be independent, but only the forms in which the understanding grasps substance in its differences; what comes third, the modes, is that under which for Spinoza all difference of things alone falls
- HoP 3",248
10398,"Of the modes he says (Ethic
- HoP 3",35
10399,"They are mere modifications which only exist for us apart from God; therefore whatever refers to this difference and is specially brought about by it, is not absolute, but finite
- HoP 3",186
10401,"These then are Spinoza’s general forms, this is his principal idea
- HoP 3",74
10402,"Some further determinations have still to be mentioned
- HoP 3",62
10403,"Its development is extremely simple, or rather it is not developed at all; Spinoza begins directly with mind
- HoP 3",116
10406,"The object of the idea which constitutes the human mind is body, or a certain mode of extension
- HoP 3",103
10407,"If, then, the object of the idea which constitutes the human mind, is the body, there can happen nothing in the body which is not perceived by the mind
- HoP 3",159
10409,"The idea of body, he writes (Epistol
- HoP 3",44
10410,"The body which it represents is regarded under the attribute of extension; but the idea itself is a mode of thought
- HoP 3",123
10411,"Here we see a dividing asunder; mere identity, the undistinguishable nature of all things in the Absolute, is insufficient even for Spinoza
- HoP 3",147
10412,"The individuum, individuality itself, is thus defined by Spinoza (Ethic

10413,"Individuation, the one, is a mere synthesis; it is quite a different thing from the Ichts or self-hood of Boehme (supra, pp
- HoP 3",131
10414,"If, before considering this in reference to the whole, we take it from the other side, namely from the understanding, the distinction really falls under that head; it is not deduced, it is found
- HoP 3",202
10415,"Thus, as we have already seen (p 270) “the understanding in act (intellectus actu), as also will, desire, love, must be referred to natura naturata, not to natura naturans
- HoP 3",179
10417,"Spinoza is unacquainted with an infinity of form, which would be something quite different from that of rigid, unyielding substance
- HoP 3",139
10418,"What is requisite is to recognize God as the essence of essences, as universal substance, identity, and yet to preserve distinctions
- HoP 3",140
10419,"Spinoza goes on to say: “What constitutes the real (actuale) existence of the human mind is nothing else than the idea of a particular” (individual) “thing, that actually exists,” not of an infinite thing
- HoP 3",212
10420,"But neither is the body, according to Spinoza, the cause of consciousness, nor is consciousness the cause of the body, but the finite cause is here only the relation of like to like; body is determined by body, conception by conception
- HoP 3",243
10421,"For all modes of thought have God as Cause, in so far as He is a thinking thing, and not in so far as He is revealed by means of another attribute
- HoP 3",154
10423,"If, therefore, the body can perceive no qualities of a thing, the soul also can come to no knowledge of it
- HoP 3",114
10426,"But the individual thing, its Notion, and the Notion of this Notion are altogether and entirely one and the same thing, only regarded under different attributes
- HoP 3",168
10427,"As the soul is nothing else than the immediate Notion of the body, and is one and the same thing with this, the excellence of the soul can never be anything else than the excellence of the body
- HoP 3",201
10428,"The capacities of the understanding are nothing but the capacities of the body, if they are looked at from the corporeal point of view, and the decisions of the will are likewise determinations of the body
- HoP 3",213
10430,"All individual things mutually presuppose each other; one cannot be thought without the other; that is to say they constitute together an inseparable whole; they exist side by side in one utterly indivisible, infinite Thing, and in no other way whatever”  3
- HoP 3",265
10431,"Its great principle is no other than this, that the finite spirit is moral in so far as it has the true Idea, ie in so far as it directs its knowledge and will on God, for truth is merely the knowledge of God
- HoP 3",216
10432,"It may be said that there is no morality loftier than this, since its only requisite is to have a clear idea of God
- HoP 3",123
10433,"The first thing Spinoza speaks of in this regard is the affections: “Everything strives after self-preservation
- HoP 3",119
10434,"This striving is the actual essence of the thing, and involves only indefinite time; when referred exclusively to mind, it is termed will; when referred to both mind and body together, it is called desire
- HoP 3",212
10435,"Determination of the will (volitio) and Idea are one and the same thing
- HoP 3",79
10436,"The sense of liberty rests on this, that men do not know the determining causes of their actions
- HoP 3",104
10438,"The more a man recognizes God’s existence and loves Him, the less does he suffer from evil affections and the less is his fear of death”206 Spinoza requires in addition the true kind of knowledge
- HoP 3",203
10440,"The second kind of knowledge is for Spinoza that which we derive from general conceptions and adequate ideas of the properties of things
- HoP 3",144
10442,"Every idea of an individual thing necessarily includes the eternal and infinite essence of God in itself
- HoP 3",112
10443,"For individual things are modes of an attribute of God; therefore they must include in themselves His eternal essence
- HoP 3",125
10444,"Our mind, in so far as it knows itself and the body under the form of eternity, has to that extent necessarily the knowledge of God, and knows that it is itself in God and is conceived through God
- HoP 3",204
10445,"All Ideas, in so far as they are referable to God, are true”208 Man must trace back all things to God, for God is the One in All; the eternal essence of God is the one thing that is, the eternal truth is the only thing for man to aim at in his actions
- HoP 3",259
10446,"In proportion as the mind regards all things as necessary, it has a greater power over its affections,” which are arbitrary and contingent
- HoP 3",146
10447,"This is the return of the mind to God, and this is human freedom; as mode, on the other hand, the spirit has no freedom, but is determined from without
- HoP 3",159
10448,"This knowledge necessarily produces the intellectual love of God; for it produces a joyfulness accompanied by the Idea of God as cause—ie the intellectual love of God
- HoP 3",174
10449,"God Himself loves Himself with an infinite intellectual love”209 For God can have only Himself as aim and cause; and the end of the subjective mind is to be directed on Him

- HoP 3",67
10451,"In the thirty-sixth Letter (pp

- HoP 3",29
10463,"How is this to be conceived?
- HoP 3",36
10466,"But in this philosophy it may with justice be objected that God is conceived only as Substance, and not as Spirit, as concrete
- HoP 3",134
10467,"The independence of the human soul is therein also denied, while in the Christian religion every individual appears as determined to salvation
- HoP 3",150
10468,"Here, on the contrary, the individual spirit is only a mode, an accident, but not anything substantial
- HoP 3",110
10469,"This brings us to a general criticism of the philosophy of Spinoza, in the course of which we shall consider it from three different points of view
- HoP 3",155
10470,"Section I p 216)—because in it no distinction is drawn between God and the world; it makes nature the real God, or lowers God to the level of nature, so that God disappears and only nature is established
- HoP 3",211
10471,"But it is not so much God and nature that Spinoza sets up in mutual opposition, as thought and extension; and God is unity, not One made up of two, but absolute Substance, in which has really disappeared the limitation of the subjectivity of thought and nature
- HoP 3",268
10472,"Those who speak against Spinoza do so as if it were on God’s account that they were interested; but what these opponents are really concerned about is not God, but the finite—themselves
- HoP 3",193
10474,"Or, in the second place, God alone exists; the finite has no reality, it is only phenomena, appearance
- HoP 3",110
10475,"To say, in the third place, that God exists and we also exist is a false synthetic union, an amicable compromise
- HoP 3",120
10476,"It is the popular view of the matter that the one side has as much substantiality as the other; God is honoured and supreme, but finite things also have Being to exactly the same extent
- HoP 3",193
10477,"Reason cannot remain satisfied with this “also,” with indifference like this
- HoP 3",84
10478,"The philosophic requisite is therefore to apprehend the unity of these differences in such a way that difference is not let slip, but proceeds eternally from substance, without being petrified into dualism
- HoP 3",213
10479,"Spinoza is raised above this dualism; religion is so also, if we turn its popular conceptions into thoughts
- HoP 3",115
10481,"In the respect that Spinoza does not distinguish God from the world, the finite, it is therefore correct to term his theory atheism, for his words are these: Nature, the human mind, the individual, are God revealed under particular forms
- HoP 3",245
10482,"It has been already remarked (pp
- HoP 3",40
10483,"But if Spinoza is called an atheist for the sole reason that he does not distinguish God from the world, it is a misuse of the term
- HoP 3",139
10484,"Spinozism might really just as well or even better have been termed Acosmism, since according to its teaching it is not to the world, finite existence, the universe, that reality and permanency are to be ascribed, but rather to God alone as the substantial
- HoP 3",264
10485,"Spinoza maintains that there is no such thing as what is known as the world; it is merely a form of God, and in and for itself it is nothing
- HoP 3",148
10486,"The world has no true reality, and all this that we know as the world has been cast into the abyss of the one identity
- HoP 3",126
10487,"There is therefore no such thing as finite reality, it has no truth whatever; according to Spinoza what is, is God, and God alone
- HoP 3",137
10488,"Therefore the allegations of those who accuse Spinoza of atheism are the direct opposite of the truth; with him there is too much God
- HoP 3",141
10489,"They say: If God is the identity of mind and nature, then nature or the individual man is God
- HoP 3",101
10490,"This is quite correct, but they forget that nature and the individual disappear in this same identity: and they cannot forgive Spinoza for thus annihilating them
- HoP 3",169
10491,"Those who defame him in such a way as this are therefore not aiming at maintaining God, but at maintaining the finite and the worldly; they do not fancy their own extinction and that of the world
- HoP 3",203
10492,"Spinoza’s system is absolute pantheism and monotheism elevated into thought
- HoP 3",83
10493,"Spinozism is therefore very far removed from being atheism in the ordinary sense; but in the sense that God is not conceived as spirit, it is atheism
- HoP 3",157

10496,"The second point to be considered is the method adopted by Spinoza for setting forth his philosophy; it is the demonstrative method of geometry as employed by Euclid, in which we find definitions, explanations, axioms, and theorems

10497,"Even Descartes made it his starting-point that philosophic propositions must be mathematically handled and proved, that they must have the very same evidence as mathematics
- HoP 3",180
10498,"The mathematical method is considered superior to all others, on account of the nature of its evidence; and it is natural that independent knowledge in its re-awakening lighted first upon this form, of which it saw so brilliant an example

10502,"This being so, the mathematical and demonstrative method of Spinoza would seem to be only a defect in the external form; but it is the fundamental defect of the whole position
- HoP 3",183
10503,"In this method the nature of philosophic knowledge and the object thereof, are entirely misconceived, for mathematical knowledge and method are merely formal in character and consequently altogether unsuited for philosophy
- HoP 3",230
10504,"Mathematical knowledge exhibits its proof on the existent object as such, not on the object as conceived; the Notion is lacking throughout; the content of Philosophy, however, is simply the Notion and that which is comprehended by the Notion
- HoP 3",249
10505,"Therefore this Notion as the knowledge of the essence is simply one assumed, which falls within the philosophic subject; and this is what represents itself to be the method peculiar to Spinoza’s philosophy

10508,"When the predicate is proved of the subject and necessarily combined with it, the discrepancy remains that the one as universal is related to the other as particular: therefore even although the relation is proved, there is present at the same time a secondary relation
- HoP 3",277
10509,"Mathematical science, in its true propositions respecting a whole, escapes from the difficulty by proving also the converse of the propositions, in this way obtaining for them a special definiteness by proving each proposition in both ways
- HoP 3",247
10510,"True propositions may, therefore, be looked on as definitions, and the conversion is the proof of the proposition in the form in which it is expressed
- HoP 3",158
10511,"But this means of escaping the difficulty Philosophy cannot well employ, since the subject of which something is proved is itself only the Notion or the universal, and the proposition form is therefore quite superfluous and out of place
- HoP 3",244
10512,"What has the form of the subject is in the form of an existent thing, as contrasted with the universal, the content of the proposition
- HoP 3",142
10513,"The existent thing is taken as signifying existent in the ordinary sense; it is the word which we use in every-day life, and of which we have a conception that has nothing of the Notion in it
- HoP 3",199
10514,"The converse of a proposition would simply read like this: The Notion is that which is thus popularly conceived
- HoP 3",119
10515,"This proof from the usage of language—that we also understand this to be the meaning in every-day life, or in other words that the name is correct—has no philosophic significance
- HoP 3",186
10517,"Or, in other words, this unity of the two moments is the very thing which the proof has to demonstrate, it is the Notion or the essence
- HoP 3",143
10518,"In this case it looks as if the proposition were the matter of chief importance, the truth
- HoP 3",98
10519,"But if in these really only so-called propositions, subject and predicate are in truth not alike, because one is individual and the other universal, their relation is essential, ie the reason for which they are one
- HoP 3",222
10520,"The proof has here a false position indeed, as if that subject were implicit or in itself, whereas subject and predicate are, fundamentally even, moments in separation; in the judgment “God is One,” the subject itself is universal, since it resolves itself into unity
- HoP 3",275
10522,"The proposition is then, as it were, a secondary affair; but we must ask if this proposition is true
- HoP 3",108
10523,"The result as proposition ought to be truth, but is only knowledge
- HoP 3",74
10524,"The movement of knowledge, as proof, falls therefore, in the third place, outside of the proposition, which ought to be the truth
- HoP 3",137
10525,"The essential moments of the system are really already completely contained in the presuppositions of the definitions, from which all further proofs have merely to be deduced
- HoP 3",182
10526,"But whence have we these categories which here appear as definitions?
- HoP 3",77
10527,"We find them doubtless in ourselves, in scientific culture
- HoP 3",66
10529,"For as Spinoza has set up the great proposition, all determination implies negation (supra, p 267), and as of everything, even of thought in contrast to extension, it may be shown that it is determined and finite, what is essential in it rests upon negation
- HoP 3",265
10530,"Therefore God alone is the positive, the affirmative, and consequently the one substance; all other things, on the contrary, are only modifications of this substance, and are nothing in and for themselves
- HoP 3",212
10531,"Simple determination or negation belongs only to form, but is quite another thing from absolute determinateness or negativity, which is absolute form; in this way of looking at it negation is the negation of negation, and therefore true affirmation
- HoP 3",256
10534,"There is a rigid necessity in the proof, to which the moment of self-consciousness is lacking; the ‘I’ disappears, gives itself altogether up, merely withers away
- HoP 3",170
10535,"Spinoza’s procedure is therefore quite correct; yet the individual proposition is false, seeing that it expresses only one side of the negation
- HoP 3",151
10536,"The understanding has determinations which do not contradict one another; contradiction the understanding cannot suffer
- HoP 3",127
10538,"There is lacking the infinite form, spirituality and liberty
- HoP 3",68
10539,"I have already mentioned before this (pp
- HoP 3",48
10540,"Because negation was thus conceived by Spinoza in one-sided fashion merely, there is, in the third place, in his system, an utter blotting out of the principle of subjectivity, individuality, personality, the moment of self-consciousness in Being
- HoP 3",254
10541,"Thought has only the signification of the universal, not of self-consciousness
- HoP 3",86
10543,"This has been firmly maintained by religion, theology, and the sound common sense of the common consciousness, and this form of opposition to Spinoza appears first of all in the assertion that freedom is real, and that evil exists
- HoP 3",238
10545,"Thus the soul, the Spirit, in so far as it is an individual Being, is for Spinoza a mere negation, like everything in general that is determined
- HoP 3",152
10546,"As all differences and determinations of things and of consciousness simply go back into the One substance, one may say that in the system of Spinoza all things are merely cast down into this abyss of annihilation
- HoP 3",221
10547,"But from this abyss nothing comes out; and the particular of which Spinoza speaks is only assumed and presupposed from the ordinary conception, without being justified
- HoP 3",175
10548,"Were it to be justified, Spinoza would have to deduce it from his Substance; but that does not open itself out, and therefore comes to no vitality, spirituality or activity
- HoP 3",180
10549,"His philosophy has only a rigid and unyielding substance, and not yet spirit; in it we are not at home with ourselves
- HoP 3",125
10550,"But the reason that God is not spirit is that He is not the Three in One
- HoP 3",80
10551,"Substance remains rigid and petrified, without Boehme’s sources or springs; for the individual determinations in the form of determinations of the understanding are not Boehme’s originating spirits, which energize and expand in one another (supra, pp
- HoP 3",258
10552,"This is what we find philosophically inadequate with Spinoza; distinctions are externally present, it is true, but they remain external, since even the negative is not known in itself
- HoP 3",191
10553,"Thought is the absolutely abstract, and for that very reason the absolutely negative; it is so in truth, but with Spinoza it is not asserted to be the absolutely negative
- HoP 3",178
10556,"If, in conclusion, we sum up this criticism that we have offered, we would say that on the one hand with Spinoza negation or privation is distinct from substance; for he merely assumes individual determinations, and does not deduce them from substance
- HoP 3",259
10557,"On the other hand the negation is present only as Nothing, for in the absolute there is no mode; the negative is not there, but only its dissolution, its return: we do not find its movement, its Becoming and Being
- HoP 3",221
10558,"The negative is conceived altogether as a vanishing moment—not in itself, but only as individual self-consciousness; it is not like the Separator we met with in Boehme’s system (supra, p 206)
- HoP 3",199
10559,"Self-consciousness is born from this ocean, dripping with the water thereof, ie never coming to absolute self-hood; the heart, the independence is transfixed—the vital fire is wanting
- HoP 3",191
10560,"This lack has to be supplied, the moment of self-consciousness has to be added
- HoP 3",86
10562,"As was formerly the case with respect to Bacon and Boehme, the former aspect is here taken up by the Englishman, John Locke, the latter by the German Leibnitz; in the first case it did not appear as a moment, nor did it in the second appear as absolute Notion
- HoP 3",267
10564,"Both Locke and Leibnitz therefore came forward as opponents of the above-mentioned one-sidedness of Spinoza
- HoP 3",115
10566,"Nicholas Malebranche was born at Paris in 1638
- HoP 3",54
10567,"He was sickly and deformed in body, and was hence brought up with great care
- HoP 3",84
10568,"He was diffident and loved solitude; in his twenty-second year he entered the congrégation de l’oratoire, a sort of spiritual order, and devoted himself to the sciences
- HoP 3",176
10569,"In passing a bookseller’s shop he happened accidentally to see Descartes’ work De homine; he read it, and it interested him greatly—so much so that the reading of it brought on severe palpitation and he was forced to cease
- HoP 3",230
10570,"This decided his future life; there awoke in him an irrepressible inclination for Philosophy
- HoP 3",100
10571,"He was a man of most noble and gentle character, and of the most genuine and unswerving piety
- HoP 3",101
10572,"He died at Paris in 1715, and in the seventy-seventh year of his age210 His principal work bears the title: De la recherche de la vérité
- HoP 3",144
10573,"One part of it is entirely metaphysical, but the greater part is altogether empirical
- HoP 3",93
10574,"For instance, Malebranche in the first three books treats logically and psychologically of the errors in sight and hearing, in the imagination and understanding
- HoP 3",168
10575,"He says: “The essence of the soul is in thought, just as that of matter is in extension
- HoP 3",95
10576,"All else, such as sensation, imagination and will, are modifications of thought”
- HoP 3",88
10577,"He thus begins with two sides, between which he sets an absolute chasm, and then he follows out in detail the Cartesian idea of the assistance of God in knowledge
- HoP 3",170
10579,"This question regarding the association of thought and extension is always an important one in Philosophy
- HoP 3",113
10580,"According to Malebranche the answer is, “That we see all things in God” God Himself is the connection between us and them, and thus the unity between the thing and thought
- HoP 3",179
10581,"God thus is the place of spirits,” the Universal of spirit, “just as space” is the universal, “the place of bodies
- HoP 3",122
10583,"If this be further analyzed it in no way differs from Spinozism
- HoP 3",71
10584,"Malebranche indeed in a popular way allows soul and things to subsist as independent, but this independence vanishes away like smoke when the principle is firmly grasped
- HoP 3",177
10585,"The catechism says: “God is omnipresent,” and if this omnipresence be developed Spinozism is arrived at; and yet theologians then proceed to speak against the system of identity, and cry out about Pantheism
- HoP 3",214
10586,"The universal is not a mere confusion of individual ideas, it is not a union of individual things” According to Locke the individual from which the universal is formed precedes (infra, p 299); according to Malebranche the universal Idea is what comes first in man
- HoP 3",271
10587,"All essentiality precedes our particular conceptions, and this essentiality comes first
- HoP 3",95
10588,"He it is who contains all things in the simplicity of His nature
- HoP 3",72
10589,"It seems evident that mind would not be capable of representing to itself the universal Notions of species, kind, and suchlike, if it did not see all things comprehended in one” The universal is thus in and for itself, and it does not take its rise through the particular
- HoP 3",279
10590,"As with Spinoza, the one universal is God, and in so far as it is determined, it is the particular; we see this particular only in the universal, as we see bodies in space
- HoP 3",179
10591,"To know a finite we must limit the infinite; and this last must thus precede
- HoP 3",84
10593,"The truth is uncreated, unchangeable, immeasurable, eternal above all things; it is true through itself, and has its perfection from no thing
- HoP 3",149
10594,"It makes the creator more perfect, and all spirits naturally seek to know it: now there is nothing that has these perfections but God, and thus the truth is God
- HoP 3",168
10595,"We perceive these unchangeable and eternal truths, hence we see God” “God indeed sees but He does not feel sensuous things
- HoP 3",130
10596,"If we see something sensuous, sensation and pure thought are to be found in our consciousness
- HoP 3",101
10597,"Sensation is a modification of our spirit; God occasions this because He knows that our soul is capable of it
- HoP 3",117
10598,"We further find sundry empty litanies concerning God, a catechism for children of eight years of age respecting goodness, justice, omnipresence, the moral order of the world; in all their lifetime theologians do not get any further
- HoP 3",239
10599,"We have given the principal of Malebranche’s ideas; the remainder of his philosophy is composed partly of formal logic, and partly of empirical psychology
- HoP 3",162
10600,"He passes to the treatment of errors, how they arise, how the senses, the imagination, the understanding, deceive us, and how we must conduct ourselves in order to effect a remedy
- HoP 3",187
10601,"Thus here the term Philosophy was even applied to the manner in which reflections on particular objects are drawn from formal logic and external facts
- HoP 3",158
10602,"It was Locke who became the instrument of setting forth this entire manner of thinking in a systematic way, for he worked out Bacon’s position more fully
- HoP 3",161
10603,"And if Bacon made sensuous Being to be the truth, Locke demonstrated the universal, Thought, to be present in sensuous Being, or showed that we obtained the universal, the true, from experience
- HoP 3",201
10607,"According to Spinoza and Malebranche substance or the universal is the true, the sole existent, the eternal, that which is in and for itself, without origin, and of which particular things are only modifications which are conceived through substance
- HoP 3",257
10608,"But hereby Spinoza has done an injury to this negative; he hence arrived at no immanent determination, for all that is determined and individual is merely annihilated in his system
- HoP 3",188
10610,"But those who were the instruments of this tendency comprehended themselves but little, they had still no clear consciousness of their task, nor of the manner in which their claims could be satisfied
- HoP 3",207
10611,"Locke does not get beyond the ordinary point of view of consciousness, viz that objects outside of us are the real and the true
- HoP 3",135
10612,"The finite is thus not grasped by Locke as absolute negativity, ie in its infinitude; this we shall not find until we come to deal in the third place with Leibnitz
- HoP 3",171
10613,"It is in a higher sense that Leibnitz asserts individuality, the differentiated, to be self-existent and indeed objectless, to be true Being
- HoP 3",148
10614,"That is to say, it is not according to him finite, but is yet distinguished; thus, each monad is itself the totality
- HoP 3",124
10615,"Leibnitz and Locke hence likewise stand in a position of mutual independence and antagonism
- HoP 3",99
10616,"He studied for himself the Cartesian philosophy at Oxford, setting aside the scholastic philosophy which was still in vogue
- HoP 3",131
10617,"He devoted himself to the study of medicine, which, however, on account of his delicate health, he never really practised
- HoP 3",129
10618,"In 1664 he went with an English ambassador for a year to Berlin
- HoP 3",71
10619,"After his return to England, he became acquainted with the intellectual Earl of Shaftesbury of that time, who availed himself of his medical advice, and in whose house he lived without requiring to give himself up to practice
- HoP 3",233
10620,"Owing to his dread of falling a prey to consumption, he betook himself in 1675 to Montpellier for the benefit of his health
- HoP 3",131
10621,"When his patron came into power again he once more recovered the place he had lost, only to be again deposed on a fresh overthrow of this minister, and he was now compelled to flee from England
- HoP 3",201
10623,"The Court party persecuted him even here, and by royal warrant he was ordered to be taken prisoner and sent to England; consequently he had to remain hidden with his friends
- HoP 3",181
10626,"In respect of method, Locke thus employs an exactly opposite system to that of Spinoza
- HoP 3",94
10627,"In the methods of Spinoza and Descartes an account of the origin of ideas may be dispensed with; they are accepted at once as definitions, such as those of substance, the infinite, mode, extension, etc, all of which constitute a quite incoherent list
- HoP 3",258
10628,"But we require to show where these thoughts come in, on what they are founded, and how they are verified
- HoP 3",112
10629,"Thus Locke has striven to satisfy a true necessity
- HoP 3",58
10631,"That is a further step than any reached by Spinoza, who begins at once with definitions and axioms which are unverified
- HoP 3",127
10632,"Now they are derived, and no longer oracularly laid down, even if the method and manner whereby this authentication is established is not the right one
- HoP 3",159
10633,"That is to say, here the matter in question is merely subjective, and somewhat psychological, since Locke merely describes the methods of mind as it appears to us to be
- HoP 3",176
10634,"For in his philosophy we have more especially to deal with the derivation of the general conceptions, or ideas, as he called them, that are present in our knowledge, and with their origin as they proceed from what is outwardly and inwardly perceptible
- HoP 3",259
10635,"Malebranche no doubt likewise asks how we arrive at conceptions, and thus he apparently has before him the same subject of investigation as has Locke
- HoP 3",157
10636,"But firstly, this psychological element in Malebranche is merely the later development, and then to him the universal or God is plainly first, while Locke commences at once with individual perceptions, and only from them does he proceed to Notions, to God
- HoP 3",263
10637,"The universal to Locke is, therefore, merely a later result, the work of our minds; it is simply something pertaining to thought, as subjective
- HoP 3",151
10640,"Thus the course adopted by Locke is quite a correct one, but all dialectic considerations are utterly and entirely set aside, since the universal is merely analyzed from the empirical concrete
- HoP 3",200
10641,"And in this matter Kant reproaches Locke with reason, the individual is not the source of universal conceptions, but the understanding
- HoP 3",142
10642,"As to Locke’s further reflections, they are very simple
- HoP 3",63
10643,"Locke considers how the understanding is only consciousness, and in being so is something in consciousness, and he only recognizes the implicit in as far as it is in the same
- HoP 3",182
10644,"Locke likewise makes special examination of the “inborn impressions (notiones communes in foro interiori descriptæ)” which Lord Herbert assumes in his work De veritate
- HoP 3",175
10645,"In the first book of his work Locke combats the so-called innate ideas, theoretic as well as practical, ie the universal, absolutely existent ideas which at the same time are represented as pertaining to mind in a natural way
- HoP 3",233
10646,"Locke said that we arrive first at that which we call idea
- HoP 3",66
10647,"By this he understands not the essential determinations of man, but conceptions which we have and which are present and exist in consciousness as such: in the same way we all have arms and legs as parts of our bodies, and the desire to eat exists in everyone
- HoP 3",266
10648,"In Locke we thus have the conception of the soul as of a contentless tabula rasa which is by-and-by filled with what we call experience215 The expression “innate principles” was at that time common, and these innate principles have sometimes been foolishly spoken of
- HoP 3",274
10649,"But their true signification is that they are implicit, that they are essential moments in the nature of thought, qualities of a germ, which do not yet exist: only in relation to this last there is an element of truth in Locke’s conclusions
- HoP 3",248
10651,"As they are regarded they are bound to have value in and for themselves; but this is a mere assertion
- HoP 3",109
10652,"From the other point of view the question of whence they come is a futile one
- HoP 3",85
10653,"Mind is undoubtedly determined in itself, for it is the explicitly existent Notion; its development signifies the coming to consciousness
- HoP 3",145
10654,"But the determinations which it brings forth from itself cannot be called innate, for this development must be occasioned by an external, and only on that does the activity of mind react, in order that it may for the first time become conscious of its reality
- HoP 3",267
10655,"The grounds on which Locke refutes innate ideas are empirical
- HoP 3",69
10657,"If it be meant that the use of reason assists us in the knowledge of these maxims, it would prove them not to be innate” Reason is said to be the deriving from principles already known unknown truths
- HoP 3",207
10658,"How then should the application of reason be required to discover supposed innate principles?
- HoP 3",101
10659,"This is a weak objection, for it assumes that by innate ideas we understand those which man possesses in consciousness as immediately present
- HoP 3",149
10660,"But development in consciousness is something altogether different from any inherent determination of reason, and therefore the expression innate idea is undoubtedly quite wrong
- HoP 3",185
10662,"In the second book Locke goes on to the next stage, to the origin of ideas, and seeks to demonstrate this process from experience—this is the main object of his efforts
- HoP 3",176
10663,"The reason that the positive point of view which he opposes to any derivation from within, is so false, is that he derives his conceptions only from outside and thus maintains Being-for-another, while he quite neglects the implicit
- HoP 3",239
10665,"Innate ideas have already been refuted
- HoP 3",46
10666,"To this I answer in a word, from Experience: in that all our knowledge is founded”217  As to the question in point we must in the first place say that it is true that man commences with experience if he desires to arrive at thought
- HoP 3",239
10667,"Everything is experienced, not merely what is sensuous, but also what excites and stimulates my mind
- HoP 3",108
10668,"Consciousness thus undoubtedly obtains all conceptions and Notions from experience and in experience; the only question is what we understand by experience
- HoP 3",163
10669,"In a usual way when this is spoken of the idea of nothing particular is conveyed; we speak of it as of something quite well known
- HoP 3",137
10670,"But experience is nothing more than the form of objectivity; to say that it is something which is in consciousness means that it has objective form for consciousness or that consciousness experiences it, it sees it as an objective
- HoP 3",238
10671,"Experience thus signifies immediate knowledge, perception, ie I myself must have and be something, and the consciousness of what I have and am is experience
- HoP 3",164
10672,"Now there is no question as to this, that whatever we know, of whatever kind it may be, must be experienced, that rests in the conception of the thing
- HoP 3",158
10673,"It is absurd to say that one knows anything which is not in experience
- HoP 3",78
10674,"I undoubtedly know men, for instance, from experience, without requiring to have seen them all, for I have, as man, activity and will, a consciousness respecting what I am and what others are
- HoP 3",199
10675,"The rational exists, ie it is as an existent for consciousness, or this last experiences it; it must be seen and heard, it must be there or have been there as a phenomenon in the world
- HoP 3",192
10677,"It is now quite a matter of indifference whether anything is accepted as something experienced, as a succession of empirical ideas, if one may so say, or conceptions; or whether the succession is a succession of thoughts, ie implicitly existent
- HoP 3",252
10678,"Locke treats of the various kinds of these ideas imperfectly and empirically merely
- HoP 3",91
10679,"According to Locke simple ideas arise partly from outward, and partly from inward experience
- HoP 3",100
10681,"From reflections come the ideas of faith, doubt, judgment, reasoning, thinking, willing, etc; from both combined, pleasure, pain, etc This is a very commonplace account of the matter
- HoP 3",190
10682,"After Locke has presupposed experience, he goes on to say that it is the understanding which now discovers and desires the universal—the complex ideas
- HoP 3",158
10684,"For it being once furnished with simple ideas it can put them together in several combinations” According to Locke therefore thought itself is not the essence of the soul, but one of its powers and manifestations
- HoP 3",220
10685,"He maintains thought to be existent in consciousness as conscious thought, and thus brings it forward as a fact in his experience, that we do not always think
- HoP 3",166
10686,"Experience demonstrates dreamless sleep when the sleep is profound
- HoP 3",74
10687,"Locke quotes the example of a man who remembered no dream until he had reached his twenty-fifth year
- HoP 3",108
10688,"It is as in the Xenien,—219    Oft schon war ich, und hab’ wirklich an gar nichts gedacht
- HoP 3",97
10689,"That is to say, my object is not a thought
- HoP 3",50
10691,"Locke likewise distinguishes (Bk
- HoP 3",40
10692,"Pure modes are simple determinations such as power, number, infinitude; in such expressions as causality we reach, on the other hand, a mixed mode
- HoP 3",154
10695,"This however is no deduction, but only a setting aside of other determinations; since distance itself is really space, mind thus determines space from space
- HoP 3",164
10696,"Similarly we reach the notion of time through the unbroken succession of conceptions during our waking moments,222 ie from determinate time we perceive time in general
- HoP 3",175
10697,"Conceptions follow one another in a continual succession; if we set aside the particular element that is present we thereby receive the conception of time
- HoP 3",162
10698,"Substance (which Locke does not accept in so lofty a sense as Spinoza), a complex idea, hence arises from the fact that we often perceive simple ideas such as blue, heavy, etc, in association with one another
- HoP 3",216
10700,"From this observation we get our ideas of cause and effect,” for instance when wax is melted by the fire225 Locke goes on to say: “Every one, I think, finds in himself a power to begin or forbear, continue or put an end to several actions in himself
- HoP 3",257
10701,"From the consideration of the extent of this power of the mind over the actions of the man, which every one finds in himself, arise the ideas of liberty and necessity”226  We may say that nothing can be more superficial than this derivation of ideas
- HoP 3",257
10702,"The matter itself, the essence, is not touched upon at all
- HoP 3",66
10703,"A determination is brought into notice which is contained in a concrete relationship; hence the understanding on the one hand abstracts and on the other establishes conclusions
- HoP 3",184
10704,"The basis of this philosophy is merely to be found in the transference of the determinate to the form of universality, but it was just this fundamental essence that we had to explain
- HoP 3",190
10706,"For what can be clearer than to say that we have the notion of time because we perceive time, if we do not actually see it, and that we conceive of space because we see it?
- HoP 3",180

10889,"The monads are simple substances” The proof that they constitute the truth in all things is very simple, it is a superficial reflection

- HoP 3",104
10895,"These monads are not, however, something abstract and simple in itself, like the empty Epicurean atoms, which, as they were in themselves lacking in determination, drew all their determination from their aggregation alone
- HoP 3",229
10896,"The expression creation we are familiar with from religion, but it is a meaningless word derived from the ordinary conception; in order to be a thought and to have philosophic significance, it must be much more closely defined

10898,"Each of them is so much for itself that all its determinations and modifications go on in itself alone, and no determination from without takes place

- HoP 3",126
10903,"It can neither get outside itself, nor can others get inside it”249 That is also Spinoza’s way of regarding matters: each attribute entirely represents the essence of God for itself, extension and thought have no influence on each other

10911,"But what we have further to consider is the determined difference in themselves
- HoP 3",87
10912,"The difference must be a difference in themselves, not for our comparison, for the subject must have the difference as its own peculiar characteristic or determination, ie the determination must be immanent in the individual
- HoP 3",232
10913,"Not only do we distinguish the animal by its claws, but it distinguishes itself essentially thereby, it defends itself, it preserves itself
- HoP 3",147
10914,"If two things are different only in being two, then each of them is one; but the fact of their being two does not constitute a distinction between them; the determined difference in itself is the principal point
- HoP 3",219
10915,"Fourthly: “The determinateness and the variation thereby established is, however, an inward implicit principle; it is a multiplicity of modifications, of relations to surrounding existences, but a multiplicity which remains locked up in simplicity
- HoP 3",255
10916,"Determinateness and variation such as this, which remains and goes on in the existence itself, is a perception;” and therefore Leibnitz says all monads perceive or represent (for we may translate perceptio by representation Vorstellung)
- HoP 3",244
10917,"In other words, they are in themselves universal, for universality is just simplicity in multiplicity, and therefore a simplicity which is at the same time change and motion of multiplicity
- HoP 3",197
10918,"This is a very important determination; in substance itself there is negativity, determinateness, without its simplicity and its implicitude being given up
- HoP 3",163
10919,"Further, in it there is this idealism, that the simple is something in itself distinguished, and in spite of its variation, that it yet remains one, and continues in its simplicity
- HoP 3",188
10920,"An instance of this is found in “I,” my spirit
- HoP 3",54
10921,"I have many conceptions, a wealth of thought is in me, and yet I remain one, notwithstanding this variety of state
- HoP 3",122
10922,"This identity may be found in the fact that what is different is at the same time abrogated, and is determined as one; the monads are therefore distinguished by modifications in themselves, but not by external determinations
- HoP 3",232
10923,"These determinations contained in the monads exist in them in ideal fashion; this ideality in the monad is in itself a whole, so that these differences are only representations and ideas
- HoP 3",194
10924,"This absolute difference is what is termed the Notion; what falls asunder in the mere representation is held together
- HoP 3",125
10925,"This is what possesses interest in Leibnitz’s philosophy
- HoP 3",64
10926,"Such ideality in the same way pertains to the material, which is also a multiplicity of monads; therefore the system of Leibnitz is an intellectual system, in accordance with which all that is material has powers of representation and perception
- HoP 3",253
10927,"As thus representing, the monad, says Leibnitz, possesses activity; for activity is to be different, and yet to be one, and this is the only true difference
- HoP 3",164
10928,"The monad not only represents, it also changes; but in doing so, it yet remains in itself absolutely what it is
- HoP 3",119
10929,"This variation is based on activity
- HoP 3",43
10930,"Indeed, this intellectuality of all things is a great thought on the part of Leibnitz: “All multiplicity is included in unity;”251 determination is not a difference in respect of something else, but reflected into itself, and maintaining itself
- HoP 3",252
10931,"This is one aspect of things, but the matter is not therein complete; it is equally the case that it is different in respect of other things
- HoP 3",148
10932,"Fifthly: These representations and ideas are not necessarily conscious representations and ideas, any more than all monads as forming representations are conscious
- HoP 3",171
10933,"It is true that consciousness is itself perception, but a higher grade of the same; perceptions of consciousness Leibnitz calls apperceptions
- HoP 3",149
10934,"The difference between the merely representing and the self-conscious monads Leibnitz makes one of degrees of clearness
- HoP 3",127
10935,"The expression representation has, however, certainly something awkward about it, since we are accustomed to associate it only with consciousness, and with consciousness as such; but Leibnitz admits also of unconscious representation
- HoP 3",241
10936,"Sixthly: These monads constitute the principle of all that exists
- HoP 3",73
10937,"Matter is nothing else than their passive capability
- HoP 3",60
10939,"This is implicitly activity; “mere implicitness without actualization” would therefore be a better expression
- HoP 3",117
10940,"The transition from obscurity to distinctness Leibnitz exemplifies by the state of swooning
- HoP 3",99
10943,"Continuity is in fact to be regarded in them as an arrangement, a similarity in themselves
- HoP 3",98
10944,"Leibnitz therefore defines their movements as like one another, as a harmony in themselves;258 but again, this is as much as saying that their similarity is not in themselves
- HoP 3",182
10945,"In fact continuity forms the essential determination of the inorganic; but it must at the same time not be taken as something external or as likeness, but as penetrating or penetrated unity, which has dissolved individuality in itself like a fluid
- HoP 3",255
10946,"But to this point Leibnitz does not attain, because for him monads are the absolute principle, and individuality does not annul itself
- HoP 3",142
10947,"A higher degree of Being is found in bodies with life and soul, in which one monad has dominion over the rest
- HoP 3",117
10948,"The body which is bound up with the monad, of which the one monad is the entelechy or soul, is with this soul named a living creature, an animal
- HoP 3",152
10949,"One such entelechy rules over the rest, yet not really, but formally: the limbs of this animal, however, are again themselves such living things, each of which has in its turn its ruling entelechy within it259 But ruling is here an inappropriate expression
- HoP 3",264
10950,"To rule in this case is not to rule over others, for all are independent; it is therefore only a formal expression
- HoP 3",122
10952,"Yet we shall later on come across this relation of the individuals to one another
- HoP 3",89
10953,"The conscious monad distinguishes itself from the naked (material) monads by the distinctness of the representation
- HoP 3",123
10954,"But this is of course only an indefinite word, a formal distinction; it indicates that consciousness is the very thing that constitutes the distinction of the undistinguished, and that distinction constitutes the determination of consciousness
- HoP 3",251
10956,"The other important principle was, on the other hand: What is not distinguished in thought is not distinguished (p 333)
- HoP 3",127
10957,"Necessary truth must have its reason in itself in such a manner that it is found by analysis, ie through that very maxim of identity
- HoP 3",140
10960,"That universal is God, as the cause of the world, to the consciousness of whom the above principle of sufficient reason certainly forms the transition
- HoP 3",158
10961,"The existence of God is only an inference from eternal truths; for these must as the laws of nature have a universal sufficient reason which determines itself as none other than God
- HoP 3",189
10962,"Eternal truth is therefore the consciousness of the universal and absolute in and for itself; and this universal and absolute is God, who, as one with Himself, the monad of monads, is the absolute Monas
- HoP 3",210
10964,"Thus God is at first comprehended chiefly as universal, but already in the aspect of the relation of opposites
- HoP 3",118
10965,"As regards this second aspect, the absolute relation of opposites, it occurs in the first place in the form of absolute opposites of thought, the good and the evil
- HoP 3",171
10966,"It is round this relation that philosophy specially revolves, but to the unity of which it did not then attain; the evil in the world was not comprehended, because no advance was made beyond the fixed opposition
- HoP 3",219
10968,"Nor is the nature of the finite therein defined
- HoP 3",55
10969,"Because the world, it is said, has to be the epitome of finite Beings, evil could not be separated from it, since evil is negation, finitude264 Reality and negation remain standing in opposition to one another exactly in the same way as before
- HoP 3",251
10970,"That is the principal conception in the Théodicée
- HoP 3",57
10971,"But something very like this can be said in every-day life
- HoP 3",66
10972,"If I have some goods brought to me in the market at some town, and say that they are certainly not perfect, but the best that are to be got, this is quite a good reason why I should content myself with them
- HoP 3",214
10973,"But comprehension is a very different thing from this
- HoP 3",61
10974,"Leibnitz says nothing further than that the world is good, but there is also evil in it; the matter remains just the same as it was before
- HoP 3",146
10975,"The next question would be: Why and how is there finitude in the Absolute and His decrees?
- HoP 3",98
10976,"And only then should there be deduced from the determination of finitude the evil which no doubt exists therein
- HoP 3",119
10977,"It is true that Leibnitz has a reply to the above question: “God does not will what is evil; evil comes only indirectly into the results” (blind), “because oftentimes the greater good could not be achieved if evils were not present
- HoP 3",239
10978,"Therefore they are means to a good end” But why does not God employ other means?
- HoP 3",88
10979,"They are always external, not in and for themselves
- HoP 3",59
10980,"Evil is in God only the object of a permissive will (voluntatis permissivæ);” but everything that is wrong would be such
- HoP 3",128
10982,"If, for example, it is said that “The law of falling bodies, in which the relation of time and space is the square, is the best possible,” one might employ, as far as mathematics are concerned, any other power whatever
- HoP 3",226
10983,"When Leibnitz answers: “God made it so,” this is no answer at all
- HoP 3",73
10984,"He goes on to say that the sufficient reason has reference to the representation of the monads
- HoP 3",102
10985,"The principles of things are monads, of which each is for itself, without having influence on the others
- HoP 3",112
10986,"If now the Monad of monads, God, is the absolute substance, and individual monads are created through His will, their substantiality comes to an end
- HoP 3",156
10987,"There is therefore a contradiction present, which remains unsolved in itself—that is between the one substantial monad and the many monads for which independence is claimed, because their essence consists in their standing in no relation to one another
- HoP 3",260
10988,"Yet at the same time, in order to show the harmony that exists in the world, Leibnitz understands the relation of monads to monads more generally as the unity of contrasted existences, namely of soul and body
- HoP 3",216
10992,"Parallel with this series of differentiated conceptions, there now runs a series of motions of the body, or of what is external to the soul269 Both are essential moments of reality; they are mutually indifferent, but they have also an essential relation of difference
- HoP 3",275
10995,"We saw from the beginning how Leibnitz arrived at this conception
- HoP 3",73
10996,"Each monad is really possessed of the power of representation, and is as such a representation of the universe, therefore implicitly the totality of the whole world
- HoP 3",172
10997,"There is not really much in all this, though it sounds very fine; for the rest of the universe is considerably more than a grain of sand, well though we knew it, and considerably different therefrom
- HoP 3",206
10998,"To say that its essence is the universe is mere empty talk: for the fact is that the universe as essence is not the universe
- HoP 3",132
10999,"To the sand grain much must be added which is not present; and since thought adds more than all the grains of sand that exist, the universe and its development may in this way certainly be comprehended
- HoP 3",209
11001,"The magnetic needle, on the contrary, has only spontaneity without consciousness, and consequently without freedom
- HoP 3",122
11005,"An organic whole, a human being, is thus for instance the assertion of his aim from out of himself: at the same time the being directed on something else is involved in his Notion
- HoP 3",187
11006,"He represents this and that to himself, he wills this and that; his activity employs itself and brings about changes
- HoP 3",124
11007,"His inward determination thus becomes corporeal determination, and then change going beyond himself; he appears as cause, influencing other monads
- HoP 3",154
11008,"But this Being-for-another is only an appearance
- HoP 3",56
11010,"But if the Being-for-another is mere appearance, the same may be said of Being-for-self; for this has significance only in reference to Being-for-another
- HoP 3",161
11012,"The separation in the Notion, which proceeds as far as release from itself, or appearance in distinct independence, Leibnitz did not succeed in bringing together into unity
- HoP 3",180
11014,"He moreover considers both of them in one unity, to be sure, but their activity is at the same time not for themselves
- HoP 3",126
11017,"Before God the monads are not to be independent, but ideal and absorbed in Him
- HoP 3",86
11018,"At this point the demand would come in that in God Himself there should be comprehended the required unity of that which before fell asunder; and God has the special privilege of having laid on Him the burden of what cannot be comprehended
- HoP 3",247
11019,"The word of God is thus the makeshift which leads to a unity which itself is only hypothetical; for the process of the many out of this unity is not demonstrated
- HoP 3",169
11020,"God plays therefore in the later philosophy a far greater part than in the early, because now the comprehension of the absolute opposition of thought and Being is the chief demand
- HoP 3",187
11022,"In that procedure a beginning is made from the determinate, this and that are stated to be necessary; but since in the next place the unity of these moments is not comprehended, it is transferred to God
- HoP 3",210
11023,"God is therefore, as it were, the waste channel into which all contradictions flow: Leibnitz’s Théodicée is just a popular summing up such as this
- HoP 3",154
11025,"These are the main moments of Leibnitz’s philosophy
- HoP 3",59
11026,"It is a metaphysic which starts from a narrow determination of the understanding, namely, from absolute multiplicity, so that connection can only be grasped as continuity
- HoP 3",178
11027,"Thereby absolute unity is certainly set aside, but all the same it is presupposed; and the association of individuals with one another is to be explained only in this way, that it is God who determines the harmony in the changes of individuals
- HoP 3",251
11028,"This is an artificial system, which is founded on a category of the understanding, that of the absoluteness of abstract individuality
- HoP 3",141
11029,"What is of importance in Leibnitz lies in the maxims, in the principle of individuality and the maxim of indistinguishability
- HoP 3",133
11030,"Wolff attained to great distinction in mathematics and made himself famous by his philosophy as well; the latter was for long predominant in Germany
- HoP 3",156
11031,"In Wolff, as a teacher dealing with the understanding, we find a systematic exposition of the philosophic element present in human conceptions as a whole
- HoP 3",161
11032,"As regards his connection with German culture generally, great and immortal praise is more especially due to him; before all others he may be termed the teacher of the Germans
- HoP 3",183
11033,"We may indeed say that Wolff was the first to naturalize philosophy in Germany
- HoP 3",86
11034,"Tschirnhausen and Thomasius likewise participated in this honour, for the special reason that they wrote upon Philosophy in the German language
- HoP 3",151
11035,"In regard to the matter of the philosophy of Tschirnhausen and Thomasius we have not much to say; it is so-called healthy reason—there is in it the superficial character and the empty universality always to be found where a beginning is made with thought
- HoP 3",262
11036,"In this case the universality of thought satisfies us because everything is present there, just as it is present in a moral maxim which has, however, no determinate content in its universality
- HoP 3",200
11037,"This is most important from the point of view of culture, and yet it does not really concern us here, excepting in so far as the content in this form of thought has caused itself to be recognized as Philosophy
- HoP 3",217
11038,"This philosophy, as a philosophy of the understanding, became the ordinary culture of the day; in it determinate, intelligent thought is the fundamental principle, and it extends over the whole circle of objects which fall within the region of knowledge
- HoP 3",261
11039,"Wolff defined the world of consciousness for Germany, and for the world in general, in the same wide sense in which we may say that this was done by Aristotle
- HoP 3",166
11040,"What distinguishes him from Aristotle is that in so doing the point of view that he adopted was that of the understanding merely, while Aristotle treated the subject speculatively
- HoP 3",187
11041,"The philosophy of Wolff is hence no doubt built on foundations laid by Leibnitz, but yet in such a manner that the speculative interest is quite eliminated from it
- HoP 3",171
11043,"He first studied Theology and then Philosophy, and in 1707 he became Professor of Mathematics and Philosophy at Halle
- HoP 3",125
11044,"Here the pietistic theologians, and more especially Lange, treated him in the basest manner
- HoP 3",99
11045,"Piety did not trust this understanding; for piety, if it is true, embodies a content which is speculative in nature, and which passes beyond the understanding
- HoP 3",166
11046,"As his opponents could make no headway by their writings, they resorted to intrigues
- HoP 3",92
11047,"Wolff thus left Halle on the 23rd of November, 1723
- HoP 3",59
11048,"But the rejoicings did not last long
- HoP 3",44
11049,"By Peter the First of Russia he was made Vice-President of the newly instituted Academy in St Petersburg
- HoP 3",112
11050,"Wolff became Vice-Chancellor of the University, but he outlived his repute, and his lectures at the end were very poorly attended
- HoP 3",137
11051,"This is an important matter, for, as we have already noticed (pp
- HoP 3",72
11052,"The Latin language has a phraseology, a definite sphere and range of conception; it is at once taken for granted that when men write in Latin they are at liberty to be dull; it is impossible to read or write what men permit themselves to say in Latin
- HoP 3",258
11053,"His mathematical works make a good many more quartos
- HoP 3",60
11054,"He brought into general use the differential and integral calculus of Leibnitz
- HoP 3",86
11055,"Hence we find in him abstract propositions and their proofs mingled with experiences, on the indubitable truth of which he builds a large part of his propositions; and he must so build and derive his foundations if a content is to result at all
- HoP 3",252
11056,"With Spinoza, on the contrary, no content is to be found excepting absolute substance and a perpetual return into the same
- HoP 3",130
11058,"Wolff entirely displaced the Aristotelian philosophy of the schools, and made Philosophy into an ordinary science pertaining to the German nation
- HoP 3",153
11059,"But besides this he gave Philosophy that systematic and requisite division into sections which has down to the present day served as a sort of standard
- HoP 3",159
11060,"In theoretic philosophy Wolff first treats of Logic purified from scholastic interpretations or deductions; it is the logic of the understanding which he has systematized
- HoP 3",178
11062,"Wolff excludes natural science and natural history
- HoP 3",58
11063,"The third part of the metaphysic is rational psychology or pneumatology, the philosophy of the soul, which deals with the simplicity, immortality, immateriality of the soul
- HoP 3",180
11064,"Finally, the fourth is natural theology, which sets forth the proofs of the existence of God277 Wolff also inserts (chap
- HoP 3",128
11065,"Practical philosophy he divides into the Rights of Nature, Morality, the Rights of Nations or Politics, and Economics
- HoP 3",125
11066,"The whole is propounded in geometric forms such as definitions, axioms, theorems, scholia, corollaries, &c In mathematics the understanding is in its proper place, for the triangle must remain the triangle
- HoP 3",213
11067,"Wolff on the one hand started upon a large range of investigation, and one quite indefinite in character, and on the other, held to a strictly methodical manner with regard to propositions and their proofs
- HoP 3",213
11068,"The method is really similar to that of Spinoza, only it is more wooden and lifeless than his
- HoP 3",101
11069,"Wolff applied the same methods to every sort of content—even to that which is altogether empirical, such as his so-called applied mathematics, into which he introduces many useful arts, bringing the most ordinary reflections and directions into the geometric form
- HoP 3",271
11070,"In many cases this undoubtedly gives his work a most pedantic aspect, especially when the content directly justifies itself to our conception without this form at all
- HoP 3",174
11071,"For Wolff proceeds by first laying down certain definitions, which really rest upon our ordinary conceptions, since these he translated into the empty form of determinations of the understanding
- HoP 3",202
11072,"Hence the definitions are merely nominal definitions, and we know whether they are correct only by seeing whether they correspond to conceptions which are referred to their simple thoughts
- HoP 3",196
11073,"The syllogism is the form of real importance in this mode of reasoning, and with Wolff it often attains to its extreme of rigidity and formalism
- HoP 3",152
11074,"Under mathematics, which is the subject of four small volumes, Wolff also treats of architecture and military science
- HoP 3",125
11075,"The next best example comes from the art of warfare
- HoP 3",59
11076,"The “Fourth proposition
- HoP 3",31
11077,"The approach to the fortress must always be harder for the enemy the nearer he comes to it” Instead of saying, because the danger is greater, which would be trivial, there follows the “Proof
- HoP 3",198
11078,"The nearer the enemy comes to the fortress, the greater the danger
- HoP 3",74
11079,"But the greater the danger the greater the resistance that must be offered in order to defy the attacks, and, so far as may be, avert the danger
- HoP 3",152
11080,"Hence the nearer the enemy is to the fort the harder must the approach be made for him
- HoP 3",94
11081,"QED”278 Since the increase of the danger is given as the reason, the whole is false, and the contrary may be said with equal truth
- HoP 3",138
11082,"For if at the beginning all possible resistance is offered to the enemy, he cannot get nearer the fortress at all, and thus the danger cannot become greater
- HoP 3",164
11083,"The greater resistance has a real cause, and not this foolish one—namely, that because the garrison is now at closer quarters, and consequently operates in a narrow field, it can offer a greater resistance
- HoP 3",213
11084,"In this most trivial way Wolff proceeds with every sort of content
- HoP 3",74
11086,"Popular philosophy flatters our ordinary consciousness, makes it the ultimate standard
- HoP 3",94
11087,"Although with Spinoza we begin with presupposed definitions, the content is still profoundly speculative in nature, and it is not derived from the ordinary consciousness
- HoP 3",177
11088,"In Spinoza thinking is not merely the form, for the content belongs to thinking itself; it is the content of thought in itself
- HoP 3",134
11089,"In the speculative content the instinct of reason satisfies itself on its own account, because this content, as a totality which integrates itself within itself, at once in itself justifies itself to thought
- HoP 3",215
11090,"The content in Spinoza is only without ground in so far as it has no external ground, but is a ground in itself
- HoP 3",119
11091,"But if the content is finite, a demand for an external ground is indicated, since in such a case we desire to have a ground other than this finite
- HoP 3",154
11092,"Until the time of Kant the philosophy of Wolff was thus pre-eminent
- HoP 3",75
11093,"The Wolffian philosophy was thus carried on, although it had cast off its pedantic methods: no further progress was however made
- HoP 3",136
11094,"The question dealt with was how perfection could be attained—what it is possible to think and what not; metaphysic was reduced to its slightest consistency and to its completest vacuity, so that in its texture not a single thread remained secure
- HoP 3",253
11095,"Mendelssohn considered himself, and was considered, the greatest of philosophers, and was lauded as such by his friends
- HoP 3",127
11096,"In his “Morgenstunden” we really find a dry Wolffian philosophy, however much these gentlemen endeavoured to give their dull abstractions a bright Platonic form
- HoP 3",168
11097,"The forms of Philosophy which we have considered bear the character which pertains specially to metaphysics, of proceeding from general determinations of the understanding, but of combining therewith experience and observation, or the empiric method in general
- HoP 3",268
11098,"One side of this metaphysic is that the opposites of thought are brought into consciousness, and that attention is directed upon the solution of this contradiction
- HoP 3",171
11100,"The solution of these opposites and contradictions has still to be given, and God is set forth as the One in whom all these contradictions are solved
- HoP 3",157
11101,"This is what is common to all these philosophies as far as their main elements are concerned
- HoP 3",100
11102,"Yet we must likewise remark that these contradictions are not solved in themselves, ie that the nullity of the supposition is not demonstrated in itself, and thereby a true concrete solution has not come to pass
- HoP 3",219
11103,"Even if God is recognized as solving all contradictions, God as the solution of these contradictions is a matter of words rather than something conceived and comprehended
- HoP 3",178
11105,"This, however, is no real comprehension of such contradiction
- HoP 3",69
11106,"This metaphysic contrasts greatly with the old philosophy of a Plato or an Aristotle
- HoP 3",92
11107,"To the old philosophy we can always turn again and admit its truth; it is satisfying in the stage of development it has reached—a concrete centre-point which meets all the problems set by thought as these are comprehended
- HoP 3",229
11108,"In this modern metaphysic, however, the opposites are merely developed into absolute contradictions
- HoP 3",107
11109,"God is indeed given as their absolute solution, but only as an abstract solution, as a Beyond; on this side all contradictions are, as regards their content, unsolved and unexplained
- HoP 3",190
11110,"God is not comprehended as the One in whom these contradictions are eternally resolved; He is not comprehended as Spirit, as the Trinity
- HoP 3",144
11111,"It is in Him alone as Spirit, and as Spirit which is Three in One, that this opposition of Himself and His Other, the Son, is contained, and with it the resolution of the same; this concrete Idea of God as reason, has not as yet found an entrance into Philosophy

11113,"Once more we see Scepticism making its way into this arid philosophy of the understanding
- HoP 3",97
11114,"But this time it is, properly speaking, in the form of Idealism, or the determinations are subjective determinations of self-consciousness
- HoP 3",146
11115,"In the place of thought we consequently find the Notion now making its appearance
- HoP 3",89
11116,"Just as with the Stoics determinateness is held to be an object of thought, we have in modern times this same manifestation of thought as the unmoved form of simplicity
- HoP 3",176
11118,"With the ancients reason (λόγος), as the implicit and explicit Being of consciousness, had only an ethereal and formal existence as language, but here it has certainty as existent substance
- HoP 3",197
11119,"Hence with Descartes there is the unity of the Notion and Being, and with Spinoza the universal reality
- HoP 3",111
11120,"The first commencement of the Notion of the movement of fixed thoughts in themselves is found in this, that the movement which, as method, simply falls outside its object, comes within it, or that self-consciousness comes within thought
- HoP 3",244
11121,"Thought is implicitude without explicitude, an objective mode bearing no resemblance to a sensuous thing; and yet it is quite different from the actuality of self-consciousness
- HoP 3",184
11123,"It is in those two ways, and in those ways alone, that the actual Notion is present in the succeeding chapter; for not as yet is it in the third place to be found as taken back into thought, or as the self-thinking or thought-of Notion
- HoP 3",243
11124,"These three aspects again divide themselves as before into the three nations which alone count in the civilized world
- HoP 3",125
11130,"But when men make what we call sound reason—that which is by nature implanted in man’s breast—into the content and the principle, the healthy human understanding discovers itself to be identical with a feeling and knowledge belonging to nature
- HoP 3",251
11131,"The Indians who worship a cow, and who expose or slay new-born children, and commit all sorts of barbarous deeds, the Egyptians who pray to a bird, the apis, &c, and the Turks as well, all possess a healthy human understanding similar in nature
- HoP 3",252
11132,"But the healthy human understanding and the natural feeling of rude and barbarous Turks, when taken as a standard, result in shocking principles
- HoP 3",152
11133,"Here natural feelings and the healthy human understanding are thus made the principle; and much may be recognized as coming under these heads
- HoP 3",149
11134,"This then is the form taken by Philosophy in the eighteenth century
- HoP 3",75
11135,"Taken as a whole, three points of view have to be considered; in the first place, Hume must be regarded on his own account, then the Scottish, and, thirdly, the French philosophy
- HoP 3",186
11136,"Hume is a sceptic; the Scottish philosophy opposes the scepticism of Hume, the French philosophy has in the “enlightenment” of Germany (by which expression is indicated that form of German philosophy which is not Wolffian metaphysics) an appendage of a feebler form
- HoP 3",273
11137,"Since from the metaphysical God we can make no further progress in the concrete, Locke grounds his content on experience
- HoP 3",128
11138,"But that empiricism leads thought to no fixed standpoint, Hume demonstrates by denying every universal; the Scottish philosophers, on the contrary, undoubtedly maintain universal propositions and truths, but not through thought
- HoP 3",235
11139,"Hence in empiricism itself the fixed standpoint has now to be adopted; thus the French find the universal in the actuality which they call réalité
- HoP 3",154
11140,"They do not, however, find its content in and from thought, but as living substance, as nature and matter
- HoP 3",113
11141,"All this is a further working out of reflecting empiricism, and some more details respecting it must still be given
- HoP 3",123
11142,"Thought generally is simple, universal self-identity, but in the form of negative movement, whereby the determinate abrogates itself
- HoP 3",140
11143,"This movement of Being-for-self is now an essential moment of thought, while hitherto it was outside it; and thus grasping itself as movement in itself, thought is self-consciousness—at first indeed formal, as individual self-consciousness
- HoP 3",247
11144,"Such a form it has in scepticism, but this distinction marks it off from the older scepticism, that now the certainty of reality is made the starting point
- HoP 3",163
11145,"With the ancients, on the contrary, scepticism is the return into individual consciousness in such a way that to it this consciousness is not the truth, in other words that scepticism does not give expression to the results arrived at, and attains no positive significance
- HoP 3",280
11147,"The crudest form of this idealism is when self-consciousness, as individual or formal, does not proceed further than to say: All objects are our conceptions
- HoP 3",164
11148,"This idealism, in which all external reality disappears, has before it the standpoint of Locke, and it proceeds directly from him
- HoP 3",137
11149,"For we saw that to Locke the source of truth is experience, or Being as perceived
- HoP 3",89
11151,"This Being-for-another, however, was not by him accepted as the Notion, but as falling within self-consciousness—ie self-consciousness not looked on as universal,—not within mind, but within what is opposed to the implicit
- HoP 3",230
11153,"In 1784 his collected works were published in London in two quarto volumes
- HoP 3",82
11154,"Berkeley advocated an idealism which came very near to that of Malebranche
- HoP 3",82
11155,"As against the metaphysic of the understanding, we have the point of view that all existence and its determinations arise from feeling, and are constituted by self-consciousness
- HoP 3",185
11156,"Berkeley’s first and fundamental thought is consequently this: “The Being of whatever is called by us a thing consists alone in its being perceived,” ie our determinations are the objects of our knowledge
- HoP 3",212
11159,"But in like manner the manifold sensuous conceptions and feelings can only exist in a mind
- HoP 3",98
11160,"Locke certainly distinguished extension and movement, for example, as fundamental qualities, ie as qualities which pertain to the objects in themselves
- HoP 3",159
11162,"In Berkeley the relation of things to consciousness is alone dealt with, and beyond this relationship they do not in his view come
- HoP 3",138
11163,"From this it follows that it is only self-consciousness that possesses them; for a perception which is not in a conceiving mind is nothing: it is a direct contradiction
- HoP 3",176
11164,"There can be no substance, he says, which neither conceives nor perceives, and which is yet the substratum of perceptions and conceptions
- HoP 3",145
11166,"This inconceivability, however, is destroyed in the Notion, for the Notion is the negative of things; and this moved Berkeley and Leibnitz to shut up the two sides in themselves
- HoP 3",185
11167,"There nevertheless remains a relationship of what is “other” to us; these feelings do not develop from us as Leibnitz represents, but are determined through somewhat else
- HoP 3",178
11168,"Each individual is thus determined through another, and not through us; and it does not matter what this external is, since it remains a contingent
- HoP 3",155
11169,"Now in relation to the two sides of Leibnitz which are indifferent to one another, Berkeley says that such an “other” is quite superfluous
- HoP 3",146
11171,"This conception gives an instance of the difficulties which appear in regard to these questions, and which Berkeley wished to escape from in a quite original way
- HoP 3",169
11172,"The inconsistency in this system God has again to make good; He has to bear it all away; to Him the solution of the contradiction is left
- HoP 3",145
11174,"It is pretty much a matter of indifference whether we believe in things or in perceptions, if self-consciousness remains possessed entirely by finalities; it receives the content in the ordinary way, and that content is of the ordinary kind
- HoP 3",248
11175,"In its individuality it stumbles about amid the conceptions of an entirely empirical existence, without knowing and understanding anything else about the content: that is to say in this formal idealism reason has no content of its own
- HoP 3",242
11177,"This kind of investigation keeps entirely to the phenomenal, and only therein distinguishes the various sorts of phenomena; or comprehension only reaches as far as to distinctions
- HoP 3",187
11178,"The only point of interest is that these investigations have in their course chiefly lighted on space, and a dispute is carried on as to whether we obtain the conception of distance and so on, in short all the conceptions relating to space, through sight or feeling
- HoP 3",273
11181,"Nothing is thought in the form of thought, but only as an external, as something foreign to thought

11183,"David Hume was born in 1711 at Edinburgh and died there in 1776
- HoP 3",71
11184,"He held a librarian’s post in that town for some time, then he became secretary to the Embassy in Paris; for quite a long period, indeed, he moved in diplomatic circles
- HoP 3",176
11185,"In Paris he came to know Jean Jacques Rousseau and invited him to England, but Rousseau’s terribly distrustful and suspicious nature very soon estranged the two288 Hume is more celebrated as a writer of history than through his philosophic works
- HoP 3",253
11186,"He wrote: “A Treatise of human nature,” 3 vols, 1739, translated into German by Jacob, Halle, 1790, 8vo; likewise “Essays and Treatises on several subjects,” 2 vols

11187,"I containing “Essays moral, political and literary,” printed for the first time in Edinburgh, 1742; Vol
- HoP 3",111
11189,"We must shortly deal with the main aspects of Hume’s philosophy
- HoP 3",71
11190,"He starts directly from the philosophic standpoint of Locke and Bacon, which derives our conceptions from experience, and his scepticism has the idealism of Berkeley as its object
- HoP 3",187
11191,"The sequence of thought is this: Berkeley allows all ideas to hold good as they are; in Hume the antithesis of the sensuous and universal has cleared and more sharply defined itself, sense being pronounced by him to be devoid of universality
- HoP 3",249
11192,"Berkeley does not make any distinction as to whether in his sensations there is a necessary connection or not
- HoP 3",117
11193,"Formerly experience was a mixture of the two elements
- HoP 3",61
11194,"Hume tells us that all perceptions of the mind may be divided into two classes or species, that of impressions, ie sensuous perceptions, and thoughts or ideas; the latter are similar in content to the former, but less forcible and lively
- HoP 3",245
11197,"Hume has thus destroyed the objectivity or absolute nature of thought-determinations
- HoP 3",92
11200,"For in what we term such, that which we properly speaking perceive is merely the fact that something first of all happens and that then something else follows
- HoP 3",166
11202,"We have merely seen the water pressing or moving along in this direction, and subsequently the house falling down; and so with other examples
- HoP 3",149
11203,"Necessity is thus not justified by experience, but we carry it into experience; it is accidentally arrived at by us and is subjective merely
- HoP 3",148
11204,"This kind of universality which we connect with necessity, Hume calls custom
- HoP 3",84
11205,"Because we have often seen results to follow we are accustomed to regard the connection as a necessary one; the necessity to him is thus a quite contingent association of ideas, which is custom
- HoP 3",201
11206,"It is the same thing in respect of the universal
- HoP 3",56
11207,"What we perceive are individual phenomena and sensations in which we see that this is now one thing and now another
- HoP 3",123
11208,"It may likewise be that we perceive the same determination frequently repeated and in manifold ways
- HoP 3",107
11209,"But this is still far removed from universality; universality is a determination which is not given to us through experience
- HoP 3",132
11210,"It may be said that this is quite a correct remark on Hume’s part, if by experience we understand outward experience
- HoP 3",124
11211,"Experience is sensible that something exists, but nevertheless the universal is not as yet present in it
- HoP 3",112
11212,"Indeed, sensuous existence as such is something which is set forth as indifferent, not differentiated from anything else; but sensuous existence is likewise universal in itself, or the indifference of its determinateness is not its only determinateness
- HoP 3",260
11213,"But since Hume regards necessity, the unity of opposites, as resting quite subjectively on custom, we cannot get any deeper in thought
- HoP 3",142
11214,"Custom is indeed so far a necessity in consciousness, and to this extent we really see the principle of this idealism in it; but in the second place this necessity is represented as something quite devoid of thought or Notion
- HoP 3",233
11215,"This custom obtains both in our perception which relates to sensuous nature, and in relation to law and morality
- HoP 3",120
11216,"The ideas of justice and morality rest upon an instinct, on a subjective, but very often deceptive moral feeling293 From a sceptical point of view the opposite may likewise be demonstrated
- HoP 3",196
11217,"From this side Hume considers justice, morality, religious determinations, and disputes their absolute validity
- HoP 3",119
11220,"What is by one nation called immoral, shameful and irreligious, is by another not considered so at all
- HoP 3",110
11221,"Thus because such matters rest upon experience, one subject has such and such an experience, finds, for instance, in his religious feelings this determination which inclines him to God, while another subject has different experiences altogether
- HoP 3",252
11222,"We are in the habit of allowing one thing to be just and moral, others have another mode of regarding it
- HoP 3",112
11223,"Hence if the truth depends upon experience, the element of universality, of objectivity, &c, comes from elsewhere, or is not justified by experience
- HoP 3",156
11224,"Hume thus declared this sort of universality, as he declared necessity, to be rather subjectively than objectively existent; for custom is just a subjective universality of this kind
- HoP 3",190
11225,"This is an important and acute observation in relation to experience looked at as the source of knowledge; and it is from this point that the Kantian reflection now begins
- HoP 3",179
11226,"Hume (Essays and Treatises on several subjects, Vol
- HoP 3",59
11227,"To such a system of reasoning from thoughts and possibilities another method of reasoning may again be opposed, and this reasoning is no better than the other
- HoP 3",166
11228,"But where a universality is found, it does not rest in the matter in itself, but is simply a subjective necessity which is really mere custom
- HoP 3",149
11229,"Hence the result which Hume arrives at is necessarily astonishment regarding the condition of human knowledge, a general state of mistrust, and a sceptical indecision—which indeed does not amount to much
- HoP 3",211
11231,"But on the other side it is empty, without content or principles of its own; and if a content is in question at all, it must keep to those inclinations
- HoP 3",159
11233,"In Scotland quite another school of thought developed, and the Scotch are the foremost of Hume’s opponents; in German philosophy, on the other hand, we have to recognize in Kant another opposing force to that of Hume
- HoP 3",224
11234,"To the Scottish school many philosophers belong; English philosophy is now restricted to Edinburgh and Glasgow, in which places a number of professors belonging to this school succeeded one another
- HoP 3",205
11235,"To the scepticism of Hume they oppose an inward independent source of truth for all that pertains to religion and morality
- HoP 3",130
11236,"This coincides with Kant, who also maintains an inward source or spring as against external perception; but in the case of Kant this has quite another form than that which it possesses with the Scottish philosophers
- HoP 3",223
11237,"To them this inward independent source is not thought or reason as such, for the content which comes to pass from this inwardness is concrete in its nature, and likewise demands for itself the external matter of experience
- HoP 3",230
11238,"It consists of popular principles, which on the one hand are opposed to the externality of the sources of knowledge, and, on the other, to metaphysics as such, to abstract thought or reasoning on its own account
- HoP 3",219
11242,"One special characteristic of these Scottish philosophers is that they have sought accurately to define the principle of knowledge; but on the whole they start from the same point as that which was in Germany likewise accepted as the principle
- HoP 3",251
11243,"That is to say they represented the so-called healthy reason, or common-sense (sensus communis), as the ground of truth
- HoP 3",127
11244,"The following are the principal members of this school, each of whom has some special feature distinguishing him from the rest
- HoP 3",134
11245,"Thomas Reid, born in 1710, died as a professor in Glasgow in 1796296 He maintained the principle of common-sense
- HoP 3",120
11247,"James Beattie, born 1735, was a professor of moral philosophy in Edinburgh and Aberdeen, and died in 1803
- HoP 3",113
11248,"He likewise made common-sense the source of all knowledge
- HoP 3",65
11249,"The confirmation of common-sense must be added to the testimony of our senses
- HoP 3",85
11250,"The truth is what the necessities of my nature call upon me to believe
- HoP 3",78
11251,"Belief signifies conviction in the case of truths which are certain, in that of those which are probable, approbation
- HoP 3",125
11252,"The truth which is certain is known by means of intuition, the probable truth by means of proofs”298 Such convictions as are quite certain form the basis of actions
- HoP 3",172
11254,"To this school also belong Dugald Stewart, Edward Search,301 Ferguson, and Hutcheson, most of whom have written on morals
- HoP 3",129
11255,"The political economist Adam Smith from this point of view is likewise a philosopher, and the best known of them all
- HoP 3",124
11256,"This Scottish philosophy is now given forth in Germany as something new
- HoP 3",79
11257,"It is a popular philosophy, which, on the one hand, has the great merit of seeking in man, and in his consciousness, for the source of all that should be held by him as true, the immanence of what should be by him esteemed
- HoP 3",230
11258,"The content is at the same time a concrete content; in a certain degree, it is the antithesis of metaphysics proper, of the wandering about in abstract determinations of the understanding
- HoP 3",195
11260,"The general idea which pervades their principle is that of the healthy human understanding; to this they have added benevolent desires, sympathy, a moral sense, and from such grounds composed very excellent moral writings
- HoP 3",229
11261,"That is certainly all very well in order to understand approximately, up to a certain degree of culture, what universal thoughts are, in order to narrate their history, to appeal to examples, and to explain them; but further it does not extend
- HoP 3",251
11263,"What by the French is called Idéologie (supra, p 308) has also its place here; it is abstract metaphysics, in so far as it is an enumeration and analysis of the most simple thought-determinations
- HoP 3",203
11264,"They are not treated dialectically, but from our reflection, from our thoughts, the material is derived, and in this the determinations therein contained are demonstrated
- HoP 3",178
11265,"Two forms have to be mentioned which are of the greatest importance in respect to culture—French philosophy and the Aufklärung
- HoP 3",134
11267,"In that first idealism the whole finitude and extension of appearances, of sensations, and likewise of thoughts and determinate fixed conceptions, remain just what they are in the unphilosophic consciousness
- HoP 3",215
11269,"The French philosophy has more life, more movement, more spirit; it would perhaps be more correct to describe it as full of life and spirit
- HoP 3",147
11270,"It is the absolute Notion, which revolts against the whole reigning system of prevalent conceptions and established ideas, which overthrows all that has settled into fixity, and acquires the consciousness of perfect liberty
- HoP 3",231
11272,"All these forms, the real implicitude of the actual world and also of the supersensuous world, are therefore set aside in this spirit conscious of itself
- HoP 3",161
11274,"This is the character of the Notion in its actuality; what has reality for this all-perceiving and all-comprehending consciousness is held to be valid
- HoP 3",158
11275,"In the first place this Notion is fixed as the negative movement of the Notion only; the positive and simple, or existence, falls outside of this movement
- HoP 3",162
11276,"There remains to the Notion no distinction, no content; for all determinate content is lost in that negativity
- HoP 3",118
11277,"This empty existence is for us pure thought generally, what the French call être suprême, or if represented objectively as existent, and as in opposition to consciousness, it is matter
- HoP 3",192
11278,"Absolute Being is therefore determined as matter, as empty objectivity, through a Notion which destroys all content and determination, and has as its object this universal alone
- HoP 3",185
11279,"It is a Notion which acts only destructively, and does not again construct itself out of this matter or pure thought or pure substantiality
- HoP 3",147
11280,"We here see so-called materialism and atheism freely emerge, as the necessary result of the pure comprehending self-consciousness
- HoP 3",137
11284,"Thought is therefore a mode of the existence of matter
- HoP 3",62
11286,"The other form of the Aufklärung is, on the contrary, when absolute Being is set forth as something beyond self-consciousness, so that of itself, of its implicit Being, nothing whatever can be known
- HoP 3",206
11287,"It bears the empty name of God
- HoP 3",38
11288,"For though God may be determined in any way whatever, all these determinations fall away; He is, like x, the altogether unknown quantity
- HoP 3",144
11290,"Yet it is not matter, because this simple and empty something is negatively defined as non-existent for self-consciousness
- HoP 3",130
11291,"This all comes to the same thing, however, for matter is the universal, and is Being-for-self represented as abrogated
- HoP 3",126
11292,"But the true reflection on that unknown is this, that it exists for self-consciousness simply as a negative of the same, ie as matter, reality, the present; it is this negative for me, this is its Notion
- HoP 3",211
11293,"The difference distinguishing this from what appears to be in its entirety something “other,” and in which any one side is not permitted to say that what it thinks is such is that particular thing, is the difference which rests on this last abstraction
- HoP 3",260
11294,"Since then the Notion is present only in its negative form, positive extension remains without a Notion; it has the form of nature, of an existent, both in the physical and in the moral sphere
- HoP 3",200
11297,"The determination and knowledge of the moral sphere has similarly for its object to bring man back to his so-called natural promptings; its essence has the form of a natural impulse, and this natural impulse is termed self-love, selfishness, or benevolence
- HoP 3",264
11298,"It is required that man should live in conformity with nature; but this nature does not reach further than general expressions and descriptions, such as the state of nature we find depicted by Rousseau
- HoP 3",209
11299,"This external origin they confound with the Becoming and Notion of the matter in point
- HoP 3",94
11300,"If one were to ask vaguely what is the origin and genesis of water, and the answer were to be given that it comes from the mountains or from rain, this would be a reply in the spirit of the above philosophy
- HoP 3",214
11301,"In short, it is only the negative aspect that is interesting, and as for this positive French philosophy, it is out of the question
- HoP 3",139
11302,"But even the negative side of it belongs properly to culture mainly, with which we have here nothing to do, and the Aufklärung likewise belongs to the same
- HoP 3",163
11306,"Contrasting with this barren content there is the other and fertile side
- HoP 3",80
11307,"The positive is in its turn constituted by so-called immediately enlightening truths of the healthy human understanding, which contains nothing except this truth and the claim to find itself, and beyond this form does not pass
- HoP 3",234
11309,"It is this then that we shall have to make evident in the positive side of French philosophy
- HoP 3",100
11313,"Among the Germans we find mere chatter; they would have liked to offer explanations also, but all they have to give is in the form of miserable phenomena and individualism
- HoP 3",179
11316,"The French warred against the speculative Notion with the spirit, the Germans did so with the understanding
- HoP 3",115
11318,"The method employed is that of development from perception, from the heart; it is a comprehensive view of the entire matter, which keeps the whole ever in sight, and seeks to uphold and attain to it
- HoP 3",206
11320,"On the one hand the form of authority in general was challenged, and on the other hand its matter
- HoP 3",105
11322,"The understanding has thus tried the content of religion by its standard, and has condemned it; the understanding proceeds in the same way against a concrete philosophy
- HoP 3",176
11323,"What of religion has in many theologies been very commonly left remaining is what is termed theism, faith in general; this is the same content which is found also in Mohammedanism
- HoP 3",187
11324,"But along with this attack upon religion on the part of the reasoning understanding there has been also a movement towards materialism, atheism and naturalism
- HoP 3",166
11325,"It is true that we should not make the charge of atheism lightly, for it is a very common occurrence that an individual whose ideas about God differ from those of other people is charged with lack of religion, or even with atheism
- HoP 3",238
11326,"But here it really is the case that this philosophy has developed into atheism, and has defined matter, nature, &c, as that which is to be taken as the ultimate, the active, and the efficient
- HoP 3",199
11327,"Some Frenchmen, Rousseau for instance, are not, however, to be included with the rest; one of this author’s works, “The Confession of Faith of a Vicar,”304 contains the very same theism which is found in German theologians
- HoP 3",230
11328,"Thus French metaphysics finds a parallel not only in Spinoza (supra, p 382) but also in the German metaphysics of Wolff
- HoP 3",127
11329,"Other Frenchmen have confessedly gone over to naturalism; among them is specially to be mentioned Mirabaud, to whom the Système de la Nature is attributed
- HoP 3",162
11332,"What we call religion is firm faith, conviction that there is a God; if this is faith in the doctrines of Christianity, it is more or less abstracted from
- HoP 3",162
11333,"But in this attack against religion we have to think of something quite different from the above; in what we find here, the positive of religion is the negative of reason
- HoP 3",178
11338,"Those who enforced these views were therefore agents of destruction against that alone which was in itself already destroyed
- HoP 3",132
11339,"We must represent to ourselves the horrible state of society, the misery and degradation in France, in order to appreciate the services that these writers rendered
- HoP 3",171
11340,"Hypocrisy and cant, imbecility of mind and the tyranny which sees itself robbed of its prey, may say that attacks were made on religion, on the state, and on manners
- HoP 3",173
11341,"But what a religion!
- HoP 3",28
11342,"Not the religion that Luther purified, but the most wretched superstition, priestly domination, stupidity, degradation of mind, and more especially the squandering of riches and the revelling in temporal possessions in the midst of public misery
- HoP 3",253
11343,"And what a state!
- HoP 3",25
11344,"The blindest tyranny of ministers and their mistresses, wives and chamberlains; so that a vast army of petty tyrants and idlers looked upon it as a right divinely given them to plunder the revenues of the state and lay hands upon the product of the nation’s sweat
- HoP 3",271
11345,"The shamelessness, the dishonesty were past belief; and morals were simply in keeping with the corruptness of the institutions
- HoP 3",134
11346,"In regard to practical politics, the writers in question never even thought of a revolution, but desired and demanded reforms alone, and that these should be subjective mainly; they called on the Government to sweep away abuses, and appoint honourable men as ministers
- HoP 3",276
11348,"The philosophers of whom we are speaking were able to give only a general idea of what ought to be done; they could not indicate the mode in which the reforms were to be carried out
- HoP 3",189
11349,"It was the Government’s business to make arrangements and carry out reforms in concrete shape; but it did not perceive this
- HoP 3",131
11350,"To treat barbarians as laymen is quite as it should be—barbarians are nothing but laymen; but to treat thinking men as laymen is very hard
- HoP 3",146
11352,"There thus manifests itself in them the fanaticism of abstract thought
- HoP 3",78
11353,"French court manners, operas, gardens, dresses, were widely adopted in Germany, but not French philosophy; yet in the form of wit and jest much of it found its way into this upper world, and much that was evil and barbarous was driven away
- HoP 3",247
11354,"Nothing else was at that time required in his nation; one cannot ask that he should have reformed and revolutionized it, since not a single person yet demanded representative government and the publicity of courts of justice

11355,"He introduced what there was need of, religious tolerance, legislation, improvements in the administration of justice, economy in the revenues of state; of the wretched German law there remained no longer in his states even the merest phantom

11356,"He showed what was the object and purpose of the state, and at the same time cast down all privileges, the private rights which pertained to Germans, and arbitrary statute laws

11357,"It is foolish when cant and German pseudo-patriotism pounce down upon him now, and try to disparage the greatness of a man whose influence was so enormous, and would even detract from his fame by a charge of vanity and wickedness

11358,"What German patriotism aims at should be reasonable

11359,"The affirmative content of this philosophy certainly does not satisfy the requirements of profundity
- HoP 3",108
11360,"A leading characteristic of its teaching, which is found also with the Scottish philosophers and with ourselves, is the assumption of primitive feelings of justice which man has in himself, as for example benevolence and social instincts which should be cultivated
- HoP 3",272
11361,"The positive source of knowledge and of justice is placed in human reason and the common consciousness of mankind, in the healthy human reason, and not in the form of the Notion
- HoP 3",185
11363,"But in order to find the nature of spirit, to discover what this determination is, a return was made to perception, observation, experience, to the existence of certain impulses
- HoP 3",185
11364,"These are certainly determinations in ourselves, but we have not known them in their necessity
- HoP 3",102
11365,"Such an impulse is besides taken as natural, and thus it is here indeterminate in itself, it has its limitation only as a moment of the whole
- HoP 3",149
11366,"In regard to knowledge, very abstract thoughts are to be found—though of a truth they are quite as good as ours, and more ingenious—which according to their content ought to be concrete, and also were so
- HoP 3",211
11367,"But so superficially were they comprehended that they soon showed themselves far from sufficient for what had to be derived from them
- HoP 3",141
11368,"They said, for instance, that Nature is a whole, that all is determined by laws, through a combination of different movements, through a chain of causes and effects, and so on; the various properties, materials, connections of things bring everything to pass
- HoP 3",266
11369,"These are general phrases, with which one can fill whole books
- HoP 3",70
11370,"To this philosophy belongs the Système de la Nature, the leading work on the subject, written in Paris by a German, Baron von Hollbach, who was the central figure of all those philosophers
- HoP 3",196
11371,"Montesquieu, d’Alembert, Rousseau, were for a time in his circle; however much these men were moved to indignation at the existing state of things, they were yet in other respects very different from one another
- HoP 3",219
11372,"The Système de la Nature may very easily be found tiresome to read, because it treats discursively of general conceptions, which are often repeated; it is not a French book, for vivacity is lacking and the mode of presentation is dull
- HoP 3",242
11373,"The different qualities of these materials, their manifold connections, and the effects which result therefrom, constitute essences for us
- HoP 3",146
11374,"From the diversity of these essences arise the different orders, species, systems, under which things fall, and whose sum total, the great whole, is what we call Nature”305 It is like what Aristotle (vide Vol

11375,"I p 241) says of Xenophanes, that he gazed into the blue, ie into Being
- HoP 3",79
11377,"Another work of importance is the still more “dangerous” treatise, De la Nature, by Robinet
- HoP 3",99
11378,"In it there reigns quite a different and a deeper spirit; one is frequently struck by the depth of earnestness which the writer displays
- HoP 3",144
11379,"He begins thus: “There is a God, ie a cause of the phenomena of that Whole which we call Nature
- HoP 3",103
11380,"The eternal Cause, who so to speak had sown (engrainé) events one in the other, in order that they might without fail follow one upon another as He chose, in the beginning set in motion the endless chain of things

11381,"Through this permanent impression the Universe goes on living, moving and perpetuating itself
- HoP 3",101
11382,"From the unity of cause there follows the unity of activity, for even it does not appear as something to be more or less admitted
- HoP 3",137
11383,"By virtue of this single act all things come to pass
- HoP 3",60
11384,"Since man has made Nature his study, he has found no isolated phenomenon, and no independent truth, because there are not and cannot be such
- HoP 3",148
11385,"The whole sustains itself through the mutual correspondence of its parts”308 The activity of Nature is one, as God is One
- HoP 3",129
11386,"This activity, more particularly regarded, signifies that germs unfold themselves in everything: everywhere there are organic Beings which produce themselves; nothing is isolated, everything is combined and connected and in harmony
- HoP 3",239
11387,"Robinet here goes through the plants, the animals, and also the metals, the elements, air, fire, water, &c; and seeks from them to demonstrate the existence of the germ in whatever has life, and also how metals are organized in themselves
- HoP 3",246
11389,"Of the minerals he says: “Are we not compelled to regard as organic bodies all those in which we meet with an inward structure such as this?
- HoP 3",148
11391,"Although he seeks to prove this too much from the sensuous side, he yet proceeds from principles in themselves concrete, from the form in itself
- HoP 3",152
11392,"He speaks also of the evil and good in the world
- HoP 3",56
11393,"The result of his observation is that good and evil balance each other; this equilibrium constitutes the beauty of the world
- HoP 3",132
11395,"The result of the French philosophy is that it insisted on maintaining a general unity, not abstract, but concrete
- HoP 3",122
11396,"Thus Robinet now propounded the theory of a universal organic life, and a uniform mode of origination; this concrete system he called Nature, over which God was set, but as the unknowable; all predicates which could be expressed of Him contained something inapplicable
- HoP 3",276
11397,"We must admit that grand conceptions of concrete unity are to be found here, as opposed to the abstract metaphysical determinations of the understanding, eg the fruitfulness of Nature
- HoP 3",191
11399,"Two determinations found in all philosophy are the concretion of the Idea and the presence of the spirit in the same; my content must at the same time be something concrete, present
- HoP 3",189
11400,"This concrete was termed Reason, and for it the more noble of those men contended with the greatest enthusiasm and warmth
- HoP 3",129
11401,"Thought was raised like a standard among the nations, liberty of conviction and of conscience in me
- HoP 3",107
11402,"They said to mankind, “In this sign thou shalt conquer,” for they had before their eyes what had been done in the name of the cross alone, what had been made a matter of faith and law and religion—they saw how the sign of the cross had been degraded
- HoP 3",257
11403,"For in the sign of the cross lying and deceit had been victorious, under this seal institutions had become fossilized, and had sunk into all manner of degradation, so that this sign came to be represented as the epitome and root of all evil
- HoP 3",248
11404,"Thus in another form they completed the Reformation that Luther began
- HoP 3",77
11405,"This concrete had manifold forms; social instincts in the practical sphere, laws of nature in the theoretical
- HoP 3",117
11406,"There is present the absolute impulse to find a compass immanent in themselves, ie in the human mind
- HoP 3",108
11407,"For the human mind it is imperative to have a fixed point such as this, if, indeed, it is to be within itself, if it is to be free in its own world at least
- HoP 3",164
11408,"But this striving after really present vitality took forms which as by-paths were themselves one-sided
- HoP 3",110
11409,"In this striving after unity, which was, however, concrete unity, the further varieties of the content likewise lie
- HoP 3",123
11411,"Hence they accept sensation and matter as the only truth, to which must be reduced all thought, all morality, as a mere modification of sensation
- HoP 3",153
11412,"The unities which the French propounded were in this way one-sided
- HoP 3",74
11414,"This reduction of all thought to sensation, which in certain respects took place with Locke, becomes a widely extended theory
- HoP 3",133
11415,"The Système de la Nature (T I chap
- HoP 3",42
11416,"The leading thought is this: “Abstract thoughts are only modes in which our inmost organ views its own modifications
- HoP 3",124
11418,"Other great writers have opposed to the above the feeling in the breast, the instinct of self-preservation, benevolent dispositions towards others, the impulse to fellowship, which last Puffendorf also made the foundation of his system of law (supra, p 321)
- HoP 3",265
11419,"From this point of view much that is excellent has been said
- HoP 3",68
11422,"With all self-sacrifice there is always conjoined some satisfaction, some finding of self; this element of self, subjective liberty, must always be present
- HoP 3",163
11423,"If this is taken in a one-sided sense, there may be consequences drawn from it which overthrow all that is sacred; but it is found in equal degree in a morality as noble as any possibly can be
- HoP 3",200
11425,"But now this further phase appeared, that pure thought was set up as the principle and content, even if again there was lacking to this content the true consciousness of its peculiar form; for it was not recognized that this principle was thought
- HoP 3",254
11426,"We see it emerge in the sphere of will, of the practical, of the just, and so apprehended that the innermost principle of man, his unity with himself, is set forth as fundamental and brought into consciousness, so that man in himself acquired an infinite strength
- HoP 3",271
11427,"It is this that Rousseau from one point of view said about the state

11428,"He investigated its absolute justification, and inquired as to its foundation

11430,"To renounce his liberty signifies to renounce his manhood

11431,"Not to be free is therefore a renunciation of a man’s rights as a human being, and even of his duties” The slave has neither rights nor duties

11432,"Rousseau therefore says (chap

11433,"The solution is given by the Social Contract;” this is the association of which each is a member by his own will

11434,"These principles, thus abstractly stated, we must allow to be correct, yet the ambiguity in them soon begins to be felt
- HoP 3",127
11435,"Man is free, this is certainly the substantial nature of man; and not only is this liberty not relinquished in the state, but it is actually in the state that it is first realized
- HoP 3",187
11436,"The freedom of nature, the gift of freedom, is not anything real; for the state is the first realization of freedom
- HoP 3",123
11437,"The misunderstanding as to the universal will proceeds from this, that the Notion of freedom must not be taken in the sense of the arbitrary caprice of an individual, but in the sense of the rational will, of the will in and for itself
- HoP 3",243
11438,"The wrong apprehension of these principles does not concern us
- HoP 3",70
11439,"What does concern us is this, that thereby there should come into consciousness as content the sense that man has liberty in his spirit as the altogether absolute, that free-will is the Notion of man
- HoP 3",207
11440,"Freedom is just thought itself; he who casts thought aside and speaks of freedom knows not what he is talking of
- HoP 3",120
11441,"The unity of thought with itself is freedom, the free will
- HoP 3",66
11442,"Thought, as volition merely, is the impulse to abrogate one’s subjectivity, the relation to present existence, the realizing of oneself, since in that I am endeavouring to place myself as existent on an equality with myself as thinking
- HoP 3",243
11443,"It is only as having the power of thinking that the will is free
- HoP 3",72
11444,"The principle of freedom emerged in Rousseau, and gave to man, who apprehends himself as infinite, this infinite strength
- HoP 3",129
11445,"This furnishes the transition to the Kantian philosophy, which, theoretically considered, made this principle its foundation; knowledge aimed at freedom, and at a concrete content which it possesses in consciousness
- HoP 3",223
11446,"The Germans were at this time quietly drifting along in their Leibnitzo-Wolffian philosophy, in its definitions, axioms and proofs
- HoP 3",138
11448,"Utility as the essence of existent things signifies that they are determined as not being in themselves, but for another: this is a necessary moment, but not the only one
- HoP 3",178
11449,"The German Aufklärung warred against ideas, with the principle of utility as its weapon
- HoP 3",95
11450,"Philosophic investigations on this subject had degenerated into a feeble popular treatment of it which was incapable of going deeper; they displayed a rigid pedantry and an earnestness of the understanding, but were unspiritual
- HoP 3",235
11451,"The Germans are busy bees who do justice to all nations, they are old-clothesmen for whom anything is good enough, and who carry on their haggling with everyone
- HoP 3",168
11452,"Picked up as it was from foreign nations, all this had lost the wit and life, the energy and originality which with the French had made the content to be lost sight of in the form
- HoP 3",187
11454,"Others, like Nicolai, Sulzer and their fellows, were excellent in their speculations on questions of taste and the liberal sciences; for literature and art were also to flourish among the Germans
- HoP 3",203
11455,"But with all this they only arrived at a most trivial treatment of æsthetics—Lessing313 called it shallow chatter
- HoP 3",121
11456,"Moreover, previous to the philosophy of Kant, the general principle was really the theory of happiness, which we have already met with in the philosophy of the Cyrenaics (Vol
- HoP 3",182
11457,"I p 477), and the point of view of pleasant or unpleasant sensations held good among the philosophers of that time as an ultimate and essential determination
- HoP 3",165
11458,"Yet even then, when the violence of passion causes us unpleasant   sensations, the movement (what else is this movement than the   power of loving perfections, &c?)
- HoP 3",172
11459,"It is the strength of the movement which   we enjoy, even in spite of the painful sensations which oppose   what is pleasant in the passion, and in a short time obtain the   victory
- HoP 3",189
11460,"In a stage play, on the contrary, as the imperfect object is   absent, pleasure must gain the upper hand and eclipse the small   degree of displeasure
- HoP 3",158
11461,"A passion therefore which is not followed by these results must   be altogether pleasant
- HoP 3",96
11462,"Of this sort are the imitations of the   passions which the tragedy affords”314  With such vapid and meaningless drivel they rambled on
- HoP 3",143
11463,"In addition to these, the eternity of punishment in hell, the salvation of the heathen, the difference between uprightness and godliness, were philosophic matters on which much labour was expended among the Germans, while the French troubled themselves little about them
- HoP 3",278
11466,"On this occasion it came to light how much Spinoza was really forgotten, and in what horror Spinozism was held
- HoP 3",118
11468,"This continued until Kant gave a new impulse in Germany to philosophy, which had died out in the rest of Europe
- HoP 3",119
11469,"As far as the transition to modern German philosophy is concerned, it is from Hume and Rousseau, as we have said (pp
- HoP 3",124
11470,"Descartes opposes extension to thought, as what is simply one with itself
- HoP 3",81
11471,"He is charged with dualism, but, like Spinoza and Leibnitz, he did away with the independence of the two sides, and made supreme their unity, God
- HoP 3",153
11472,"But, as this unity, God is first of all only the Third; and He is further determined in such a way that no determination pertains to Him
- HoP 3",144
11473,"But from this time an utterly different point of view is introduced
- HoP 3",75
11474,"The infinite is transported into abstraction or incomprehensibility
- HoP 3",75
11475,"This is an incomprehensible position to adopt
- HoP 3",53
11476,"Nowadays it is looked on as most pious, most justifiable
- HoP 3",64
11477,"But as we see the third, the unity of differences, defined as something which cannot be thought or known, this unity is not one of thought, for it is above all thought, and God is not simply thought
- HoP 3",206
11478,"Nevertheless this unity is defined as the absolutely concrete, ie as the unity of thought and Being
- HoP 3",107
11479,"Now we have come so far that this unity is a unity simply in thought, and pertaining to consciousness, so that the objectivity of thought—reason—comes forth as One and All
- HoP 3",179
11480,"This is dimly conceived by the French
- HoP 3",45
11481,"Whether the highest Being, this Being divested of all determination, is elevated above nature, or whether nature or matter is the highest unity, there is always present the establishing of something concrete, which at the same time belongs to thought
- HoP 3",258
11482,"Since the liberty of man has been set up as an absolutely ultimate principle, thought itself has been set up as a principle
- HoP 3",131
11483,"The principle of liberty is not only in thought but the root of thought; this principle of liberty is also something in itself concrete, at least in principle it is implicitly concrete
- HoP 3",192
11484,"Thus far have general culture and philosophic culture advanced
- HoP 3",70
11485,"Since what is knowable has now been placed entirely within the sphere of consciousness, and since the liberty of the spirit has been apprehended as absolute, this may be understood to mean that knowledge has entered altogether into the realm of the finite
- HoP 3",263
11486,"The standpoint of the finite was at the same time taken as ultimate, and God as a Beyond outside consciousness; duties, rights, knowledge of nature, are finite
- HoP 3",167
11487,"Man has thereby formed for himself a kingdom of truth, from which God is excluded; it is the kingdom of finite truth
- HoP 3",124
11488,"The form of finitude may here be termed the subjective form; liberty, self-consciousness Ichheit of the mind, known as the absolute, is essentially subjective—in fact it is the subjectivity of thought
- HoP 3",208
11489,"The more the human reason has grasped itself in itself, the more has it come down from God and the more has it increased the field of the finite
- HoP 3",152
11490,"Reason is One and All, which is at the same time the totality of the finite; reason under these conditions is finite knowledge and knowledge of the finite
- HoP 3",162
11492,"This is what we have to consider in the last period, in dealing with Kant, Fichte, and Schelling
- HoP 3",104
11494,"In this great epoch of the world’s history, whose inmost essence is laid hold of in the philosophy of history, two nations only have played a part, the German and the French, and this in spite of their absolute opposition, or rather because they are so opposite
- HoP 3",269
11495,"The other nations have taken no real inward part in the same, although politically they have indeed so done, both through their governments and their people
- HoP 3",164
11496,"In Germany this principle has burst forth as thought, spirit, Notion; in France, in the form of actuality
- HoP 3",113
11497,"In Germany, what there is of actuality comes to us as a force of external circumstances, and as a reaction against the same
- HoP 3",131
11500,"On the other hand, however, there sprang from this the philosophy of Fichte, which speculatively grasps the essence of self-consciousness as concrete egoism, but which does not reach beyond this subjective form pertaining to the absolute
- HoP 3",245
11501,"From it again comes the philosophy of Schelling, which subsequently rejects Fichte’s teaching and sets forth the Idea of the Absolute, the truth in and for itself
- HoP 3",170
11502,"In connection with Kant we must here begin by speaking of Jacobi, whose philosophy is contemporaneous with that of Kant; in both of these the advance beyond the preceding period is very evident
- HoP 3",201
11503,"The result in the two cases is much the same, although both the starting point and the method of progression are somewhat different
- HoP 3",139
11504,"In Jacobi’s case the stimulus was given mainly by French philosophy, with which he was very conversant, and also by German metaphysics, while Kant began rather from the English side, that is, from the scepticism of Hume
- HoP 3",227
11506,"Kant does not consider the content, but took the view of knowledge being subjective; and for this reason he declared it to be incapable of recognizing absolute existence
- HoP 3",177
11507,"To Kant knowledge is thus a knowledge of phenomena only, not because the categories are merely limited and finite, but because they are subjective
- HoP 3",154
11508,"To Jacobi, on the other hand, the chief point is that the categories are not merely subjective, but that they themselves are conditioned
- HoP 3",144
11509,"This is an essential difference between the two points of view, even if they both arrive at the same result
- HoP 3",115
11510,"Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, born at Düsseldorf in 1743, held office first in the Duchy of Berg, and then in Bavaria
- HoP 3",122
11511,"He studied in Geneva and Paris, associating in the former place with Bonnet and in the latter with Diderot
- HoP 3",114
11512,"Jacobi was a man of the highest character and culture
- HoP 3",61

- HoP 3",173
11514,"At the time of the French Revolution he was obliged to retire
- HoP 3",69
11515,"As a Bavarian official he went to Munich, there became President of the Academy of Sciences in 1804, which office he, however, resigned in 1812; for in the Napoleonic period Protestants were decried as demagogues
- HoP 3",220
11517,"Mendelssohn was displeased at this, and it was the occasion of the correspondence
- HoP 3",89
11518,"That Jacobi asserted Lessing to be a Spinozist, and gave a high place to the French—this serious statement came to these good men as a thunderbolt from the blue
- HoP 3",168
11519,"They—the self-satisfied, self-possessed, superior persons—were quite surprised that he also made pretensions to knowledge, and of such a “dead dog” as Spinoza (ibidem, p 68)
- HoP 3",181
11520,"Explanations followed upon this, in which Jacobi further developed his philosophic views
- HoP 3",96
11521,"A question which I do not understand, I cannot answer, it is for me as good as no question at all”316 He continued to argue on these same lines
- HoP 3",151
11522,"His proof of the existence of God thus carries with it this necessity of thought, viz that actuality must plainly be in thought, and a thinker must be presupposed, or the possibility of the actual is in the thinker
- HoP 3",222
11523,"If we take away from anything whatsoever the conception formed by a thinking Being that that thing is possible or actual, the thing itself is done away with” The Notion of the thing is thus to man the essence of the same
- HoP 3",228
11525,"Actuality, Being, has its possibility in thought, or its possibility is thought; it is not a process from possibility to actuality, for the possibility remains at home in the actuality
- HoP 3",192
11527,"Jacobi thus asserts that mediate knowledge consists in giving a cause of something which has in its turn a finite effect, and so on; so that a knowledge such as this can all through relate to the finite only
- HoP 3",215
11529,"We comprehend a thing when we can deduce it from its proximate causes,” and not from the remoter causes; the most remote and quite universal cause is always God
- HoP 3",168
11531,"For this reason we have no conceptions of qualities as such, but only intuitions
- HoP 3",88
11532,"Even of our present existence we have a feeling only, but no conceptions
- HoP 3",80
11534,"Jacobi continues: “The business of reason is really progressive union and connection, and its speculative business is union and connection in accordance with the known laws of necessity, ie of identity
- HoP 3",209
11535,"Everything that reason can bring forth by means of analysis, combination, judgment, conclusion, and re-conception, consists in nothing but things of nature” (ie finite things), “and reason itself, as a limited existence, belongs to these things
- HoP 3",252
11536,"Both are inseparably bound up with one another, and yet in such a way that the conception of the conditioned presupposes the conception of the unconditioned, and can be given in this alone
- HoP 3",196
11537,"We are just as certain of its existence as we are of our own conditioned existence, or even more so
- HoP 3",107
11540,"For if everything which can be said to arise and be present in a way comprehensible to us, must arise and be present in a conditioned way, we remain, so long as we continue to comprehend, in a chain of conditioned conditions
- HoP 3",232
11543,"Jacobi then passes on from this point to the second of his main propositions, “The unconditioned is called the supernatural
- HoP 3",131
11546,"It is thus merely a fact of my consciousness that God exists independently apart from my consciousness; this, however, is itself maintained through my consciousness; the subjective attitude of thought is thus to Jacobi the element of most importance
- HoP 3",257
11547,"The consciousness of God, which is in our consciousness, is, however, of such a nature that along with the thought of God we have immediately associated the fact that He is
- HoP 3",180
11548,"The existence of the supernatural and supersensuous, to which the thought of man regarding the natural and finite passes on, is just as certain to Jacobi as he is himself
- HoP 3",178
11549,"God, the absolute, the unconditioned, cannot, according to Jacobi, be proved
- HoP 3",84
11550,"This immediate knowledge of God is then the point which is maintained in the philosophy of Jacobi
- HoP 3",105
11551,"The faith of Kant and of Jacobi are, however, different
- HoP 3",63
11552,"To Kant it is a postulate of reason, it is the demand for the solution of the contradiction between the world and goodness; to Jacobi it is represented on its own account as immediate knowledge
- HoP 3",201
11553,"Everything which has been written upon God since Jacobi’s time, by philosophers such as Fries and by theologians, rests on this conception of immediate intellectual knowledge, and men even call this revelation, though in another sense than the revelation of theology
- HoP 3",274
11554,"Revelation as immediate knowledge is in ourselves, while the Church holds revelation to be something imparted from without324 In the theological sense, faith is faith in something which is given to us through teaching
- HoP 3",225
11556,"This is Jacobi’s standpoint, and whatever is by philosophers and theologians said against it, this teaching is eagerly accepted and disseminated
- HoP 3",152
11557,"And nowhere is there anything to be found but reflections originating from Jacobi, whereby immediate knowledge is opposed to philosophic knowledge and to reason; and people speak of reason, philosophy, &c, as a blind man speaks of colours
- HoP 3",246
11558,"It is, indeed, allowed that a man cannot make shoes unless he is a shoemaker, even although he have the measure and foot, and also the hands
- HoP 3",148
11559,"But when Philosophy is concerned, immediate knowledge signifies that every man as he walks and stands is a philosopher, that he can dogmatize as he chooses, and that he is completely acquainted with Philosophy
- HoP 3",217
11560,"By reason, however, mediate knowledge merely is on the one hand understood, and on the other the intellectual perception which speaks of facts (supra, pp
- HoP 3",161
11561,"This organ, a spiritual eye for spiritual objects, has been called by men—generally speaking—reason
- HoP 3",107
11562,"But by faith Jacobi likewise understands all that has immediacy of Being for me: “Through faith we know that we have a body, we become aware of other actual things, and that indeed with the same certainty with which we are aware of ourselves
- HoP 3",249
11563,"Thus we have a revelation of nature”325 Hence the expression faith, which had a deep significance in religion, is made use of for different contents of every kind; this in our own time is the point of view most commonly adopted
- HoP 3",235
11564,"Jacobi here brings faith into opposition with thought
- HoP 3",61
11565,"Let us compare the two, and discover whether they are separated by so great a chasm as those who thus oppose them think
- HoP 3",127
11566,"On the one hand absolute existence is to faith immediate; believing consciousness feels itself penetrated by this as by its essence: that existence is its life, believing consciousness asserts itself to be in direct unity with it
- HoP 3",237
11567,"Thought thinks the absolute existence; such existence is to it absolute thought, absolute understanding, pure thought; but that signifies that it is likewise immediate itself
- HoP 3",182
11569,"Now what is the reason that faith and thought do not understand one another, and each recognize itself in the other?
- HoP 3",124
11570,"In the first place faith has no consciousness of being a thought, inasmuch as it asserts absolute consciousness to be identical with it as self-consciousness, and has direct inward knowledge of the same
- HoP 3",210
11571,"But it expresses this simple unity; in its consciousness it is only immediacy so to speak in the signification of Being, a unity of its unconscious substance
- HoP 3",165
11572,"In the second place Being-for-self is contained in thought; to this faith opposes the immediacy of Being
- HoP 3",112
11573,"Thought, on the contrary, has the immediate as absolute potentiality, as absolutely a thing of thought: and the immediacy belonging to this thing of thought is without the determination of Being, of life
- HoP 3",211
11574,"On the heights of this abstraction the two stand opposed to each other, as the Aufklärung which asserts absolute existence to be a Beyond of self-consciousness, and as the materialism which makes it so to speak present matter (supra, pp
- HoP 3",244
11575,"In the one case it is in faith and thought as positive existence or thought, and in the other it is the negative of self-consciousness, which is thus either only determined as negative, as a Beyond, or likewise as existent for self-consciousness
- HoP 3",253
11576,"Hence faith and thought are both of them knowledge
- HoP 3",58
11578,"Thus God, even though He is only felt and believed in, is yet the universal taken quite abstractly—even in His personality He is the absolutely universal personality
- HoP 3",173
11579,"As thought and faith are thus one, the same is true of the antithesis between mediated and immediate knowledge
- HoP 3",118
11580,"But abstract immediate knowledge is natural, sensuous knowledge; the immediate man in his natural condition, in his desires, does not know this universal
- HoP 3",161
11581,"Children, the Esquimaux, &c, know nothing of God; or what the natural man knows of Him is not a real knowledge of Him
- HoP 3",125
11582,"Thus the intuitive knowledge of the Egyptians told them that God was an ox or a cat, and the Indians still possess similar sorts of knowledge
- HoP 3",149
11583,"On the other hand when man has come so far as to know God as merely an object of the mind, ie as spiritual, it is easy to perceive that this knowledge which is asserted to be immediate is really a result mediated through instruction, through a long continued culture
- HoP 3",274
11584,"It is only by means of being elevated above nature that man arrives at a consciousness of what is higher, and at a knowledge of the universal; there indeed his knowledge is immediate, but he has only arrived at this through mediation
- HoP 3",241
11585,"I think, and thus I know the universal immediately, but this very thought is just process in itself, movement and life
- HoP 3",126
11586,"All life is process within itself, is mediated, and this is all the more true of spiritual life; for it is the passing from one to the other, that is, from the merely natural and sensuous to the spiritual
- HoP 3",212
11587,"It thus indicates a deficiency in the most simple reflection not to know that the universal is not in immediate knowledge, but is a result of the culture, the education, and the self-revelation of the human race
- HoP 3",219
11588,"If immediate knowledge is to be allowed, everyone will be responsible merely to himself: this man knows this, another that, and consequently everything is justified and approved, however contrary to right and religion
- HoP 3",225
11590,"If Philosophy were to result in this it would be a poor affair; these determinations are merely forms, none of which has intrinsic truth
- HoP 3",144
11591,"The form into which Philosophy has in Jacobi’s case finally fallen, which is that immediacy is grasped as absolute, manifests a lack of all critical faculty, of all logic
- HoP 3",178
11592,"The Kantian philosophy is critical philosophy, but from it the fact has been omitted that we cannot constitute the infinite with finite categories—and immediacy is such an one
- HoP 3",183
11593,"This we know within our consciousness, and we may see it in the most general phenomena
- HoP 3",94
11594,"I know, for example, of America immediately, and yet this knowledge is very much mediated
- HoP 3",97
11595,"If I stand in America and see its soil, I must first of all have journeyed to it, Columbus must first have discovered it, ships must have been built, &c; all these discoveries and inventions pertain to it
- HoP 3",212
11596,"That which we now know immediately is consequently a result of infinitely many mediations
- HoP 3",97
11597,"Likewise when I see a right-angled triangle I know that the squares of the two sides are equal to the square of the hypotenuse: I know this immediately, and yet I have merely learned it and am convinced of it through the mediation of proof
- HoP 3",247
11599,"Knowledge, however, is something very different from what Jacobi calls such; against finite knowledge his arguments are quite correct
- HoP 3",141
11600,"Immediate knowledge is not knowledge, comprehension, for that implies that the content is determined in itself, ie is grasped as concrete
- HoP 3",145
11601,"But in immediate knowledge it is the case that the only fact known of God is that He exists
- HoP 3",99
11602,"For should there be determinations respecting God, they must, according to Jacobi, be grasped as a finite, and the knowledge of them would again merely be a progression from finite to finite
- HoP 3",198
11603,"There thus remains only the indeterminate conception of God, an “Above me,” an indeterminate Beyond
- HoP 3",107
11604,"This gives accordingly the same result as does the Aufklärung, viz that the highest reality is ultimate: we find the same in French philosophy and in Kant—only here we still have the opinion that this emptiness is the highest philosophy possible
- HoP 3",253
11607,"This however is merely abstract, for the next step is that the principle of freedom is again purified and comes to its true objectivity, so that not everything which strikes me or springs up within me must, because it is manifested in me, hold good as true
- HoP 3",264
11608,"It is only through thought, which casts off the particular and accidental, that the principle receives this objectivity which is independent of mere subjectivity and in and for itself—though in such a way that the freedom of mind still remains respected
- HoP 3",261
11609,"One’s own spirit must bear witness to spirit that God is Spirit; the content must be true
- HoP 3",97
11610,"But this does not give authenticity to itself by its being revealed with certainty to me
- HoP 3",96
11611,"This is the standpoint, and we have thus seen its deficiency and the greatness of the principle which is involved in it
- HoP 3",127
11612,"The philosophy of Kant, which we have now more particularly to consider, made its appearance at the same time as the above
- HoP 3",130
11613,"While Descartes asserted certainty to be the unity of thought and Being, we now have the consciousness of thought in its subjectivity, ie in the first place, as determinateness in contrast with objectivity, and then as finitude and progression in finite determinations
- HoP 3",276
11614,"Abstract thought as personal conviction is that which is maintained as certain; its contents are experience, but the methods adopted by experience are once more formal thought and argument
- HoP 3",196
11615,"Kant turns back to the standpoint of Socrates; we see in him the freedom of the subject as we saw it with the Stoics, but the task in respect of content is now placed on a higher level
- HoP 3",192
11616,"An endless aiming at the concrete is required for thought, a filling up in accordance with the rule which completion prescribes, which signifies that the content is itself the Idea as the unity of the Notion and reality
- HoP 3",227
11617,"The standpoint of the philosophy of Kant, on the contrary, is in the first place to be found in the fact that thought has through its reasoning got so far as to grasp itself not as contingent but rather as in itself the absolute ultimate
- HoP 3",245
11618,"In the finite, in connection with the finite, an absolute standpoint is raised which acts as a connecting bond; it binds together the finite and leads up to the infinite
- HoP 3",177
11619,"Thought grasped itself as all in all, as absolute in judgment; for it nothing external is authoritative, since all authority can receive validity only through thought
- HoP 3",174
11621,"Both standpoints remain philosophies of subjectivity; since thought is subjective, the capacity of knowing the absolute is denied to it
- HoP 3",143
11623,"On the other hand Kant argues to prove the existence of God, who is to him an hypothesis necessary for the explanation of things, a postulate of practical reason
- HoP 3",169
11624,"But in this connection another French astronomer made the following reply to the Emperor Napoleon: “Je n’ai pas eu besoin de cette hypothèse” According to this the truth underlying the Kantian philosophy is the recognition of freedom
- HoP 3",241
11625,"Even Rousseau represented the absolute to be found in freedom; Kant has the same principle, but taken rather from the theoretic side
- HoP 3",140
11627,"But however much freedom may be in itself concrete, it was as undeveloped and in its abstraction that it was there applied to actuality; and to make abstractions hold good in actuality means to destroy actuality
- HoP 3",219
11628,"The fanaticism which characterized the freedom which was put into the hands of the people was frightful
- HoP 3",111
11629,"In Germany the same principle asserted the rights of consciousness on its own account, but it has been worked out in a merely theoretic way
- HoP 3",147
11630,"The consciousness of this action in abstract form is the Kantian philosophy
- HoP 3",83
11632,"In other words the Kantian philosophy no doubt leads reality back to self-consciousness, but it can supply no reality to this essence of self-consciousness, or to this pure self-consciousness, nor can it demonstrate Being in the same
- HoP 3",241
11637,"Its study is made difficult by its diffuseness and prolixity, and by the peculiar terminology found in it
- HoP 3",113
11638,"Nevertheless this diffuseness has one advantage, that inasmuch as the same thing is often repeated, the main points are kept before us, and these cannot easily be lost from view
- HoP 3",185
11639,"We shall endeavour to trace the lines which Kant pursued
- HoP 3",64
11640,"The philosophy of Kant has in the first place a direct relation to that of Hume as stated above (p 370)
- HoP 3",111
11641,"That is to say, the significance of the Kantian philosophy, generally expressed, is from the very beginning to allow that determinations such as those of universality and necessity are not to be met with in perception, and this Hume has already shown in relation to Locke
- HoP 3",279
11644,"In the second place the philosophy of Kant is likewise called a critical philosophy because its aim, says Kant, is first of all to supply a criticism of our faculties of knowledge; for before obtaining knowledge we must inquire into the faculties of knowledge
- HoP 3",267
11645,"To the healthy human understanding that is plausible, and to it this has been a great discovery
- HoP 3",103
11646,"Knowledge is thereby represented as an instrument, as a method and means whereby we endeavour to possess ourselves of the truth
- HoP 3",135
11647,"Thus before men can make their way to the truth itself they must know the nature and function of their instrument
- HoP 3",121
11649,"And a further claim is made when it is said that we must know the faculty of knowledge before we can know
- HoP 3",113
11650,"For to investigate the faculties of knowledge means to know them; but how we are to know without knowing, how we are to apprehend the truth before the truth, it is impossible to say
- HoP 3",189
11651,"It is the old story of the σχολαστικός who would not go into the water till he could swim
- HoP 3",97
11653,"At the same time the step taken by Kant is a great and important one—that is, the fact that he has made knowledge the subject of his consideration
- HoP 3",154
11655,"The Kantian philosophy is in the first instance directed against both
- HoP 3",77
11657,"On the practical side there reigned at that time the so-called happiness theory, since man’s inherent Notion and the way to realize this Notion was apprehended in morality as a satisfaction of his desires
- HoP 3",212
11658,"As against this Kant has very rightly shown that it involves a heteronomy and not an autonomy of reason—a determination through nature and consequently an absence of freedom
- HoP 3",181
11659,"But because the rational principle of Kant was formal, and his successors could not make any further progress with reason, and yet morality had to receive a content, Fries and others must still be called Hedonists though they avoid giving themselves the name
- HoP 3",266
11661,"Kant considers thought as in great measure a synthetic activity, and hence he represents the main question of Philosophy to be this, “How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?”329 Judgment signifies the combination of thought-determinations as subject and predicate
- HoP 3",278
11662,"Synthetic judgments a priori are nothing else than a connection of opposites through themselves, or the absolute Notion, ie the relations of different determinations such as those of cause and effect, given not through experience but through thought
- HoP 3",257
11663,"Space and time likewise form the connecting element; they are thus a priori, ie in self-consciousness
- HoP 3",109
11664,"Since Kant shows that thought has synthetic judgments a priori which are not derived from perception, he shows that thought is so to speak concrete in itself
- HoP 3",165
11665,"The idea which is present here is a great one, but, on the other hand, quite an ordinary signification is given it, for it is worked out from points of view which are inherently rude and empirical, and a scientific form is the last thing that can be claimed for it
- HoP 3",272
11666,"In the presentation of it there is a lack of philosophical abstraction, and it is expressed in the most commonplace way; to say nothing more of the barbarous terminology, Kant remains restricted and confined by his psychological point of view and empirical methods
- HoP 3",272
11668,"Transcendent and transcendental have accordingly to be clearly distinguished
- HoP 3",84
11670,"Kant, on the contrary, defines the transcendental philosophy as not a philosophy which by means of categories passes beyond its own sphere, but one which points out in subjective thought, in consciousness, the sources of what may become transcendent
- HoP 3",257
11671,"Thought would thus be transcendent if the categories of universality, of cause and effect, were predicated of the object, for in this way men would from the subjective element ‘transcend’ into another sphere
- HoP 3",215
11672,"We are not justified in so doing as regards the result nor even to begin with, since we merely contemplate thought within thought itself
- HoP 3",144
11673,"Thus we do not desire to consider the categories in their objective sense, but in so far as thought is the source of such synthetic relationships; the necessary and universal thus here receive the significance of resting in our faculties of knowledge
- HoP 3",258
11675,"It is hence not constitutive in knowledge but only regulative; it is the unity and rule for the sensuous manifold
- HoP 3",121
11676,"But this unity on its own account is the unconditioned, which, transcending experience, merely arrives at contradictions
- HoP 3",128
11677,"In the practical sphere alone is reason constitutive
- HoP 3",60
11678,"The critique of reason is consequently not the knowing of objects, but of knowledge and its principles, its range and limitations, so that it does not become transcendent332 This is an extremely general account of what we shall now consider in its separate details
- HoP 3",272
11679,"In dealing with this matter Kant adopts the plan of first considering theoretic reason, the knowledge which relates to outward objects
- HoP 3",142
11680,"In the second place he investigates the will as self-actualization; and, in the third place, the faculty of judgment, the special consideration of the unity of the universal and individual; how far he gets in this matter we shall likewise see
- HoP 3",250
11681,"But the critique of the faculty of knowledge is the matter of main importance
- HoP 3",85
11682,"In the first place, as to the theoretic philosophy, Kant in the Critique of Pure Reason sets to work in a psychological manner, ie historically, inasmuch as he describes the main stages in theoretic consciousness
- HoP 3",220
11683,"The first faculty is sensuousness generally, the second understanding, the third reason
- HoP 3",95
11684,"All this he simply narrates; he accepts it quite empirically, without developing it from the Notion or proceeding by necessity
- HoP 3",134
11685,"The a priori fact of sensuous existence, the forms of sensuous existence, constitute the beginning of this transcendentalism
- HoP 3",132
11686,"Kant calls the judgment of the same the transcendental æsthetic
- HoP 3",71
11687,"Nowadays æsthetic signifies the knowledge of the beautiful
- HoP 3",66
11688,"But here the doctrine of intuition or perception is taken from the point of view of its universality, ie from what in it pertains to the subject as such
- HoP 3",160
11689,"Perception, says Kant, is the knowledge of an object given to us through the senses; sensuousness, however, is the capacity of being affected by conceptions as external
- HoP 3",176
11692,"The filling in is performed by the content, by colour, softness, hardness, &c, as regards space; while as regards time, the same content, so soon as it is something transient, or again some other content, and in particular inward feelings are what causes the determination
- HoP 3",280
11693,"Space and time are consequently pure, ie abstract perceptions in which we place outside of us the content of individual sensations, either in time as succeeding one another, or in space as separate from one another
- HoP 3",222
11694,"Here we thus meet with the division between subjectivity and objectivity, for if we isolate the ‘alongside of’ and ‘after’ we have space and time
- HoP 3",153
11697,"Space and time are conceptions a priori, because we cannot represent things without space and time
- HoP 3",106
11698,"Time is a necessary basis for all phenomena” As a priori, space and time are universal and necessary, that is to say we find this to be the case; but it does not follow that they must be previously present as conceptions
- HoP 3",228
11699,"They are fundamental indeed, but they are likewise an external universal
- HoP 3",80
11701,"The things which are eaten have not the mouth and teeth, and as eating is brought to bear on things, so space and time are also brought to bear on them; just as things are placed in the mouth and between the teeth, so is it with space and time
- HoP 3",251
11702,"For we can only represent to ourselves one space; there are not different component parts of space” The same is the case with time
- HoP 3",138
11703,"The abstract conception tree, for example, is in its actuality a number of individual and separate trees, but spaces are not such particulars, nor are they parts; for one immediate continuity remains, and hence a simple unity
- HoP 3",233
11704,"Ordinary perception has always something individual before it; space or time are always however one only, and therefore a priori
- HoP 3",136
11705,"It might however be replied to Kant: The nature of space and time undoubtedly involves their being an abstract universal; but there is in like manner only one blue
- HoP 3",171
11706,"From the transcendental point of view it is likewise maintained that this conception of space and time contains synthetic propositions a priori, connected with the consciousness of its necessity
- HoP 3",202
11708,"Kant nevertheless in the first place holds that such propositions do not take their rise from experience, or, as we might better express it, are not an individual contingent perception; this is very true, the perception is universal and necessary
- HoP 3",254
11709,"In the second place he states that we acquire them from pure sensuous perception, and not through the understanding or Notion
- HoP 3",133
11710,"But Kant does not grasp the two together, and yet this comprehension of them is involved in such propositions being immediately certain even in ordinary perception
- HoP 3",171
11711,"But what the nature of time and space is, it does not occur to the Kantian philosophy to inquire
- HoP 3",104
11712,"To it what space and time are in themselves does not signify ‘What is their Notion,’ but ‘Are they external things or something in the mind?’  b
- HoP 3",152
11713,"The second faculty, the understanding, is something very different from sensuousness; the latter is Receptivity, while Kant calls thought in general Spontaneity—an expression which belongs to the philosophy of Leibnitz
- HoP 3",226
11717,"I am this unity, the transcendental apperception, the pure apperception of self-consciousness
- HoP 3",101
11718,"I = I; I must ‘accompany’ all our conceptions337 This is a barbarous exposition of the matter
- HoP 3",101
11720,"In order that a content may enter this One, it must be infected by its simplicity; it is thus that the content first becomes my content
- HoP 3",143
11721,"The comprehending medium is ‘I’; whatever I have to do with must allow itself to be forced into these forms of unity
- HoP 3",124
11722,"This is a great fact, an important item of knowledge; what thought produces is unity; thus it produces itself, for it is the One
- HoP 3",136
11723,"Yet the fact that I am the one and, as thinking, the simplifier, is not by Kant satisfactorily set forth
- HoP 3",112
11724,"The unity may likewise be called relation; for in so far as a manifold is presupposed, and as this on the one side remains a manifold while on the other side it is set forth as one, so far may it be said to be related
- HoP 3",225
11726,"But Kant (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, pp
- HoP 3",48
11727,"For he says that in common logic particular kinds of judgment are brought forward; and since judgment is a special kind of relationship of the manifold, the various functions of thought which ‘I’ has in it are shown therein
- HoP 3",231
11728,"But the following kinds of judgment have been noticed, viz Universal, Particular and Singular; Affirmative, Negative, Infinite; Categorical, Hypothetical, Disjunctive; Assertoric, Problematic and Apodictic judgments
- HoP 3",223
11729,"These particular modes of relationship now brought forward are the pure forms of the understanding
- HoP 3",106
11730,"There are thus, according to Kant (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, pp
- HoP 3",73
11731,"Plurality is negation of the one, the assertion of difference; and the third, the bringing of the other two into one, plurality circumscribed, the indeterminate plurality comprehended as one, is the Totality
- HoP 3",215
11732,"Limitation is as real or positive as negation
- HoP 3",53
11733,"Possibility should come second; in abstract thought, however, the empty conception comes first
- HoP 3",102
11734,"It betrays a great instinct for the Notion when Kant says that the first category is positive, the second the negative of the first, the third the synthesis of the two
- HoP 3",175
11735,"The triplicity, this ancient form of the Pythagoreans, Neo-Platonists and of the Christian religion, although it here reappears as a quite external schema only, conceals within itself the absolute form, the Notion
- HoP 3",221
11736,"But since Kant says that a conception can determine itself in me as accidental, as cause, effect, unity, plurality, &c, we thereby have the whole of the metaphysics of the understanding
- HoP 3",193
11737,"Kant does not follow up further the derivation of these categories, and he finds them imperfect, but he says that the others are derived from them
- HoP 3",154
11738,"Kant thus accepts the categories in an empiric way, without thinking of developing of necessity these differences from unity
- HoP 3",132
11739,"Just as little did Kant attempt to deduce time and space, for he accepted them likewise from experience—a quite unphilosophic and unjustifiable procedure

11742,"It is only when this object of immediate perception is laid hold of and brought under universal thought-determinations that experience arises therefrom, which has a claim to validity for all time
- HoP 3",203
11743,"The category which brings the unity of thought into the content of feeling is thus the objective element in experience, which receives thereby universality and necessity, while that which is perceived is rather the subjective and contingent
- HoP 3",248
11744,"Our finding both these elements in experience demonstrates indeed that a correct analysis has been made
- HoP 3",111
11745,"Kant (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, pp
- HoP 3",44
11746,"For the first component part of experience, sensation, is doubtless subjective, since it is connected with our organs
- HoP 3",125
11747,"The matter of perception is only what it is in my sensation
- HoP 3",67
11748,"I know of this sensation only and not of the thing
- HoP 3",58
11750,"Neither the one nor the other is consequently anything in itself, nor are both together, knowledge, anything in itself, for it only knows phenomena—a strange contradiction
- HoP 3",179
11755,"Thus, for example, the conception of substance in the schema becomes permanent in time,340 ie the pure conception of the understanding, the pure category, is brought into unity with the form of pure sensuous perception
- HoP 3",226
11756,"In as far as we have to deal with our own determinations only and as we do not reach the implicit, the true objective, the Kantian philosophy called itself Idealism
- HoP 3",172
11757,"But in this connection Kant (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, pp
- HoP 3",67
11758,"But all time-determination presupposes something permanent in perception
- HoP 3",80
11760,"Conversely it may be said: I am conscious of external things as determined in time and as changing; these hence presuppose something constant which is not in them but outside of them
- HoP 3",190
11761,"And this is ‘I,’ the transcendental ground of their universality and necessity, of their implicitude, the unity of self-consciousness
- HoP 3",141
11762,"On another occasion Kant regards it thus (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, p 101): These moments confuse themselves, because the constant element is itself a category
- HoP 3",169
11763,"Idealism, when we regard it as signifying that nothing exists outside of my individual self-consciousness as individual, as also the refutation of this, the assertion that things exist outside of my self-consciousness as individual, are the one as bad as the other
- HoP 3",272
11765,"The truth or untruth does not rest in their being things or conceptions, but in their limitation and contingency, whether as conceptions or things
- HoP 3",154
11766,"The refutation of this idealism is nothing more than calling attention to the fact that this empirical consciousness does not exist in itself—just as those empiric things do not exist in themselves
- HoP 3",205
11767,"But the knowing subject does not with Kant really arrive at reason, for it remains still the individual self-consciousness as such, which is opposed to the universal
- HoP 3",173
11768,"As a matter of fact there is described in what we have seen only the empirical finite self-consciousness which requires a material from outside, or which is limited
- HoP 3",172
11770,"It would make no difference if there had been no Reason there, just as with physicists it is a matter of perfect indifference whether, for instance, there is such a thing as magnetism or not
- HoP 3",198
11771,"But the categories are themselves particular
- HoP 3",52
11772,"The principle of reason, according to Kant, is really the universal, inasmuch as it finds the unconditioned involved in the conditioned knowledge of the understanding
- HoP 3",174
11773,"Understanding is hence for him thought in finite relations; reason, on the contrary, is thought which makes the unconditioned its object
- HoP 3",144
11774,"Since Kant’s time it has become customary in the language of philosophy to distinguish understanding and reason, while by earlier philosophers this distinction was not drawn
- HoP 3",181
11776,"This, the unconditioned, must now be grasped as concrete, and therein lies the main difficulty
- HoP 3",102
11777,"For to know the unconditioned means to determine it and to deduce its determinations
- HoP 3",92
11778,"Much has been written and said on the subject of knowledge, without a definition of it ever having been offered
- HoP 3",119
11779,"But it is the business of Philosophy to see that what is taken for granted as known is really known
- HoP 3",107
11780,"Now on this point Kant says that reason has certainly the desire to know the infinite, but has not the power
- HoP 3",116
11781,"And the reason which Kant gives for this (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, pp
- HoP 3",80
11783,"But no one wishes to demand a sensuous proof in verification of the infinite; spirit is for spirit alone
- HoP 3",112
11786,"Although reason, says Kant, becomes transcendent by the exhibition of these contradictions, it still retains its claim to trace perception, experience, and knowledge pertaining to the understanding, back to the infinite
- HoP 3",227
11787,"This union of the infinite, the unconditioned, with the finite and conditioned as existing in the knowledge given by the understanding, or even in perception, would signify that the acme of concreteness had been reached
- HoP 3",227
11788,"Of this Unconditioned there are several kinds, objects having special features of their own and proceeding from reason, transcendental Ideas; they are thus themselves particular in their nature
- HoP 3",201
11789,"The manner in which Kant arrives at these Ideas is again derived from experience, from formal logic, according to which there are various forms of the syllogism
- HoP 3",168
11791,"When brought to an ultimate point, the question which meets us is whether Reason can bring these objects to reality, or whether they remain confined to subjective thought
- HoP 3",178
11792,"Now, according to Kant, Reason is not capable of procuring reality for its Ideas—otherwise it would be transcendent, its limits would be overstepped; it produces only paralogisms, antinomies, and an ideal without reality343  α
- HoP 3",234
11793,"Now is the thinking ego a substance, a soul, a soul-thing?
- HoP 3",66
11794,"Further questions are whether it is permanent, immaterial, incorruptible, personal and immortal, and such as to have a real community with the body
- HoP 3",155
11795,"The falsity of the syllogism consists in this, that the idea of the unity of the transcendental subject essential to Reason is expressed as a thing; for it is only in this way that the permanency of the same becomes substance
- HoP 3",233
11796,"Otherwise I find myself permanent in my thought, of course, but only within perceiving consciousness, not outside of that
- HoP 3",129
11797,"The ego is therefore the empty, transcendental subject of our thoughts, that moreover becomes known only through its thoughts; but of what it is in itself we cannot gather the least idea
- HoP 3",194
11798,"For thought is nothing more or less than the “in-itself” or implicit)
- HoP 3",77
11799,"I cannot therefore assign any reality to the subject344  We here see Kant fall into contradiction, what with the barbarity of the conceptions which he refutes, and the barbarity of his own conceptions which remain behind when the others are refuted
- HoP 3",256
11800,"In the first place, he is perfectly correct when he maintains that the ego is not a soul-thing, a dead permanency which has a sensuous present existence; indeed, were it to be an ordinary thing, it would be necessary that it should be capable of being experienced
- HoP 3",271
11801,"But, in the second place, Kant does not assert the contrary of this, namely that the ego, as this universal or as self-thinking, has in itself the true reality which he requires as an objective mode
- HoP 3",206
11802,"For he does not get clear of the conception of reality in which reality consists in the possession of a sensuous present existence; accordingly, because the ego is given in no outward experience, it is not real
- HoP 3",218
11803,"For self-consciousness, the ego as such, is not, according to Kant, reality; it is only our thought, or in other words he regards self-consciousness as being itself simply and entirely sensuous
- HoP 3",201
11804,"The form which Kant accordingly bestows on Being, thing, substance, would seem to indicate that these categories of the understanding were too high for the subject, too high to be capable of being predicated of it
- HoP 3",221
11805,"But really such determinations are too poor and too mean, for what possesses life is not a thing, nor can the soul, the spirit, the ego, be called a thing
- HoP 3",162
11806,"Being is the least or lowest quality that one can assign to spirit, its abstract, immediate identity with itself; Being thus no doubt pertains to spirit, but it must be considered as a determination scarcely worth applying to it
- HoP 3",236
11807,"In the second place we have the antinomy, ie the contradiction in Reason’s Idea of the Unconditioned, an Idea applied to the world in order to represent it as a complete summing-up of conditions
- HoP 3",202
11808,"That is to say, in the given phenomena Reason demands the absolute completeness of the conditions of their possibility, so far as these constitute a series, so that the unconditioned is contained in the world, ie the totality of the series
- HoP 3",247
11810,"Reason demands a perfectly complete synthesis, an absolute beginning; but in phenomena we have, on the contrary, a succession of causes and effects, which never come to an end
- HoP 3",183
11811,"Kant here points out four contradictions (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, p 320), which, however, is not enough; for in each Notion there are antinomies, since it is not simple but concrete, and therefore contains different determinations, which are direct opposites
- HoP 3",270
11812,"These antinomies in the first place involve our making the one determination, limitation, just as valid as non-limitation
- HoP 3",129
11814,"The completion of the synthesis in progression as regards time and space is, however, a first beginning of time and space
- HoP 3",129
11815,"If therefore the categories of limited and unlimited are applied to the world in order to attain to a knowledge of it, we fall into contradictions, because the categories are not applicable to things-in-themselves
- HoP 3",221
11816,"The second antinomy is that atoms, from which substance is composed, must necessarily be admitted to exist, therefore simplicity can be proved; but just as easy is it to prove incompleteness, the endless process of division
- HoP 3",231
11818,"The third antinomy is the opposition between freedom and necessity
- HoP 3",74
11819,"The first is the self-determining, the point of view pertaining to infinity: causality according to the laws of freedom is the only causality
- HoP 3",149
11820,"The other is: Determinism alone is to be found: everything is determined by means of an external ground or reason348  δδ
- HoP 3",128
11823,"The necessity of these contradictions is the interesting fact which Kant (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, p 324) has brought to consciousness; in ordinary metaphysics, however, it is imagined that one of these contradictions must hold good, and the other be disproved
- HoP 3",271
11824,"The most important point involved in this assertion of Kant’s is, however, unintentional on his part
- HoP 3",108
11825,"For he indeed solves these antinomies (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, pp
- HoP 3",77
11826,"If such determinations belonged to the world, to God, to free agents, there would be an objective contradiction; but this contradiction is not found as absolute, it pertains only to us
- HoP 3",192
11827,"Or, in other words, this transcendental idealism lets the contradiction remain, only it is not Being in itself that is thus contradictory, for the contradiction has its source in our thought alone
- HoP 3",204
11828,"Thus the same antinomy remains in our mind; and as it was formerly God who had to take upon Himself all contradictions, so now it is self-consciousness
- HoP 3",159
11829,"But the Kantian philosophy does not go on to grapple with the fact that it is not things that are contradictory, but self-consciousness itself
- HoP 3",150
11830,"Experience teaches that the ego does not melt away by reason of these contradictions, but continues to exist; we need not therefore trouble ourselves about its contradictions, for it can bear them
- HoP 3",204
11831,"Nevertheless Kant shows here too much tenderness for things: it would be a pity, he thinks, if they contradicted themselves
- HoP 3",131
11832,"But that mind, which is far higher, should be a contradiction—that is not a pity at all
- HoP 3",95
11833,"The contradiction is therefore by no means solved by Kant; and since mind takes it upon itself, and contradiction is self-destructive, mind is in itself all derangement and disorder
- HoP 3",189
11834,"The true solution would be found in the statement that the categories have no truth in themselves, and the Unconditioned of Reason just as little, but that it lies in the unity of both as concrete, and in that alone
- HoP 3",223
11835,"Kant says (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, pp
- HoP 3",49
11836,"This Kant calls the Ideal of Reason, to distinguish it from the Idea, which is only the sum of all possibility
- HoP 3",118
11837,"The Ideal is thus the Idea as existent; just as in art we give the name of ideal to the Idea realized in a sensuous manner
- HoP 3",130
11838,"Here Kant takes into consideration the proof of the existence of God, as he asks whether reality can be assigned to this Ideal
- HoP 3",134
11839,"The ontological proof proceeds from the absolute Notion, in order from it to argue up to Being
- HoP 3",102
11840,"With Anselm, Descartes, and Spinoza the transition to Being is thus made; and all of them assume in so doing the unity of Being and thought
- HoP 3",147
11841,"But Kant says (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, pp
- HoP 3",53
11842,"A hundred real dollars do not contain in the very least more than a hundred possible dollars,” they are the same content, ie the same Notion; they are also a hundred exactly
- HoP 3",181
11843,"The one is the Notion, or rather the conception, the other is the object; Being is no new determination of the Notion, otherwise my Notion of a hundred real dollars would contain something different from a hundred real dollars
- HoP 3",234
11844,"But “the object, as real, is not contained in my Notion alone; or to my Notion the real hundred dollars are synthetically added” Being cannot therefore be derived from the Notion, because it is not contained therein, but must be added to it
- HoP 3",248
11845,"The content is no doubt the same for him in what exists and in the Notion: but since Being is not involved in the Notion, the attempt to derive the one from the other is unavailing
- HoP 3",188
11846,"Of course the determination of Being is not found as positive and ready-made in the Notion; the Notion is something different from reality and objectivity
- HoP 3",162
11847,"If we therefore abide by the Notion, we abide by Being as something different from the Notion, and adhere to the separation of the two; we then have conception, and not Being at all
- HoP 3",189
11849,"But in a like popular fashion it might be said that one must leave off imagining, for that is mere conception: ie what is merely imaginary is untrue, the hundred imaginary dollars are and remain imaginary
- HoP 3",212
11850,"Therefore to believe in them is a proof of an unsound understanding, and is of no manner of use; and he is a foolish fellow who indulges in such fancies and wishes
- HoP 3",171
11851,"One possesses a hundred dollars, when they are real only; if a man has therefore so great a desire to possess a hundred dollars, he must put his hand to work in order to obtain them: ie he must not come to a standstill at the imagination of them, but pass out beyond it
- HoP 3",277
11852,"This subjective side is not the ultimate or the absolute; the true is that which is not merely subjective
- HoP 3",113
11853,"If I possess a hundred dollars, I have them actually, and at the same time I form a conception of them to myself
- HoP 3",120
11854,"But according to Kant’s representation we come to a deadlock at the difference; dualism is ultimate, and each side has independent validity as an absolute
- HoP 3",162
11855,"Against this false idea of what is to be absolute and ultimate, the healthy human understanding is directed; every ordinary consciousness rises above it, every action aims at setting aside a subjective conception and making it into something objective
- HoP 3",259
11856,"There is no man so foolish as that philosophy; when a man feels hungry, he does not call up the imagination of food, but sets about satisfying his hunger
- HoP 3",161
11857,"All activity is a conception which does not yet exist, but whose subjectivity is abrogated
- HoP 3",98
11858,"Moreover the imaginary hundred dollars become real, and the real ones imaginary: this is a frequent experience, this is their fate; it depends on circumstances entirely outward whether a hundred dollars become my property or not
- HoP 3",236
11859,"Of course the mere conception is of no good, if I obstinately hold by it: for I can imagine what I will, but that does not make it exist
- HoP 3",144
11860,"The only important point is what I conceive to myself, and then whether I think or comprehend the subjective and Being; by means of this each passes into the other
- HoP 3",171
11861,"Thought, the Notion, of necessity implies that the Notion does not remain subjective; this subjective is on the contrary abrogated and reveals itself as objective
- HoP 3",170
11862,"Now that unity is expressly affirmed by Descartes solely in reference to the Notion of God, for it is just that which is God; he speaks of no hundred dollars, as these are not an existence which has a Notion in itself
- HoP 3",225
11863,"That opposition does away with itself absolutely and entirely, ie the finite passes away; it holds good only in the philosophy of finitude
- HoP 3",146
11864,"If, therefore, there is not a Notion of existence formed, we have in it a notionless, sensuous object of perception; and what is notionless is certainly not a Notion,—therefore sensation, handling, are not Notions
- HoP 3",221
11865,"Such existence has of course no Absolute, no real essence: or such existence has no truth, it is only a vanishing moment
- HoP 3",128
11866,"This useless thrashing of the empty grainless straw of the common logic is termed philosophizing: it is like Issachar the strong ass, which could not be made to move from the spot where it was (Gen xlix
- HoP 3",210
11867,"But it is a very false idea of Christian humility and modesty to desire through one’s abjectness to attain to excellence; this confession of one’s own nothingness is really inward pride and great self-conceit
- HoP 3",216
11868,"But for the honour of true humility we must not remain in our misery, but raise ourselves above it by laying hold of the Divine
- HoP 3",135
11869,"The fact to which Kant clings most strongly (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, p 467) is this, that Being cannot be extracted from the Notion
- HoP 3",143
11870,"The result of this is the proposition that to have the thought of the Infinite is certainly Reason; but that from the Idea of Reason is separated determination in general, and especially the determination which is known as Being
- HoP 3",236
11871,"The Ideas of Reason cannot be proved from experience, or obtain from it their verification: if they are defined by means of categories, contradictions arise
- HoP 3",164
11872,"If the Idea in general is to be defined as existent only, it is nothing more or less than the Notion; and the Being of the existent is still distinguished from it
- HoP 3",170
11874,"Abstract thinking is adhered to; it is said that the understanding can only bring about order in things; but order is nothing in and for itself, it is only subjective
- HoP 3",174
11876,"The animal does not stop at this standpoint, but practically brings about unity
- HoP 3",87
11878,"But this is on the one hand very scanty and restricted in content, containing as it does sundry general qualities and conceptions of matter and motion, and with regard to the scientific side or the a priori, as Kant calls it, it is likewise altogether unsatisfactory
- HoP 3",274
11879,"For Kant assumes all such conceptions as that matter has motion and also a power of attraction and repulsion,352 instead of demonstrating their necessity
- HoP 3",161
11881,"Density, for instance, is looked on by physical science as a variable quantity, as a mere quantum in space: instead of this Kant asserted it to be a certain degree of occupation of space, ie energy, intensity of action

11885,"These are the principal points in respect to the theoretical part of Kant’s philosophy
- HoP 3",94
11886,"The second subject of review in Kant’s philosophy is the practical sphere, the nature and principle of the will; this subject is dealt with in the Critique of Practical Reason, in which Kant accepted Rousseau’s conclusion that the will is absolutely free
- HoP 3",262
11887,"Kant’s idea of theoretic Reason is that when Reason relates itself to an object, this object must be given to it; but when the object is given by Reason to itself, it has no truth; and Reason in knowledge of this kind does not arrive at independence
- HoP 3",257
11888,"As practical, on the contrary, Reason is independent in itself; as a moral Being man is free, raised above all natural law and above all phenomena
- HoP 3",154
11891,"Here we have the Notion which is sensible of its own deficiency; this theoretic Reason could not be, as in it the Notion had to remain the Notion
- HoP 3",153
11892,"Thus we have the standpoint of absoluteness revealed, since there is an infinite disclosed within the human breast
- HoP 3",122
11893,"The satisfying part in Kant’s philosophy is that the truth is at least set within the heart; and hence I acknowledge that, and that alone, which is in conformity with my determined nature

11894,"The lower faculties of desire are impulses, inclinations, etc; the higher faculty is the will as such, which has not external, individual aims, but universal
- HoP 3",165

- HoP 3",230
11897,"As a moral Being man has the moral law in himself, the principle of which is freedom and autonomy of the will; for the will is absolute spontaneity
- HoP 3",155
11898,"Determinations which are taken from the inclinations are heterogeneous principles as regards the will; or the will is heteronomy if it takes such determinations as its end and aim; for in that case it takes its determinations from something else than itself
- HoP 3",265
11899,"But the essence of the will is to determine itself from itself; for practical Reason gives itself laws
- HoP 3",110
11901,"For the will, however, there is no other aim than that derived from itself, the aim of its freedom
- HoP 3",106
11903,"Great popularity has from one point of view been won for Kantian philosophy by the teaching that man finds in himself an absolutely firm, unwavering centre-point; but with this last principle it has come to a standstill
- HoP 3",227
11904,"While the highest pinnacle of the theoretic Reason is abstract identity, because it can furnish only a canon, a rule for abstract classifications,356 practical Reason, as law-giving, is immediately regarded as concrete; the law which it gives to itself is the moral law
- HoP 3",277
11905,"But even if it is stated that it is concrete in itself, there is the further consideration that this freedom is at first only the negative of everything else; no bond, nothing external, lays me under an obligation
- HoP 3",221
11906,"It is to this extent indeterminate; it is the identity of the will with itself, its at-homeness with itself
- HoP 3",115
11907,"But what is the content of this law?
- HoP 3",44
11908,"Here we at once come back to the lack of content
- HoP 3",56
11909,"For the sole form of this principle is nothing more or less than agreement with itself, universality; the formal principle of legislation in this internal solitude comes to no determination, or this is abstraction only
- HoP 3",226

11932,"Will has the whole world, the whole of the sensuous, in opposition to it, and yet Reason insists on the unity of Nature or the moral law, as the Idea of the Good, which is the ultimate end of the world

11933,"Since, however, it is formal, and therefore has no content on its own account, it stands opposed to the impulses and inclinations of a subjective and an external independent Nature

11934,"Kant reconciles the contradiction of the two (Kritik der prakt
- HoP 3",70
11935,"For happiness is only one’s own sensuous consciousness, or the actuality of a particular individual, not universal reality in itself
- HoP 3",140

- HoP 3",141
11937,"Kant (Kritik der prakt
- HoP 3",30
11938,"The postulate itself is always there, because the Good is a Beyond with respect to Nature; the law of necessity and the law of liberty are different from one another, and placed in this dualism
- HoP 3",201
11939,"Nature would remain Nature no longer, if it were to become conformed to the Notion of the Good; and thus there remains an utter opposition between the two sides, because they cannot unite
- HoP 3",195
11940,"It is likewise necessary to establish the unity of the two; but this is never actual, for their separation is exactly what is presupposed
- HoP 3",145
11941,"Kant employs popular language thus: evil ought to be overcome, but yet must not have been overcome
- HoP 3",106
11942,"God is to him, therefore, only a faith, an opinion, which is only subjectively, and not absolutely true358 This result is also of a very popular character
- HoP 3",162
11943,"These postulates express nothing but the synthesis, devoid of thought, of the different moments which contradict each other on every hand; they are therefore a “nest”359 of contradictions
- HoP 3",195
11944,"For instance, the immortality of the soul is postulated on account of imperfect morality, ie because it is infected with sensuousness
- HoP 3",141
11945,"But the sensuous is implied in moral self-consciousness; the end, perfection, is what really destroys morality as such
- HoP 3",126
11946,"Similarly the other aim, the harmony of the sensuous and the rational, to an equal extent abrogates morality; for that consists in this very opposition of Reason to the sensuous

11953,"The absolute Good remains “what ought to be,” or without objectivity; and there it has to remain
- HoP 3",104
11955,"Kant says that the understanding no doubt regulates in the theoretic sphere and produces categories; but these remain mere general determinations, beyond which lies the particular (the other element which belongs to every item of knowledge)
- HoP 3",248
11956,"The two are distinguished from one another for the understanding; for its distinctions remain in universality
- HoP 3",117
11957,"In the practical sphere Reason is certainly the implicit, but its free independence, its law-giving freedom in higher form, is opposed to Nature in its freedom or to Nature’s own laws

11958,"Understanding and” (practical) “Reason have two different regulative systems on one and the same ground of experience, without the one being detrimental to the other
- HoP 3",173
11959,"For if the Notion of Nature has but little influence on the giving of laws by the Notion of Freedom, just as little does the latter interfere with the legislation of Nature
- HoP 3",180
11960,"The possibility of the existence side by side of the two regulative systems and of the powers belonging to them was proved in the Critique of pure Reason” (!?)
- HoP 3",167
11961,"Consequently neither of them can attain to a theoretic knowledge of its object (and even of the thinking subject) as a thing-in-itself, which last would be the supersensuous, an unlimited and inaccessible realm for our whole faculty of knowledge
- HoP 3",253
11963,"Nevertheless the latter is conceived as having an influence on the former, or, in other words, freedom is conceived as having for its mission the realization in the sensuous world of the end indicated by the laws of freedom
- HoP 3",231
11964,"Consequently Nature must be so conceived that, while in form it realizes its own laws, there may yet be a possibility of ends being realized in it according to the laws of freedom
- HoP 3",187
11967,"The understanding is the ground of this unity of the manifold; the sensuous is therefore here determined by means of the supersensuous
- HoP 3",142
11969,"But here there is also a particular which is not determined by species
- HoP 3",78
11970,"It is not as if such an intelligence must be assumed (for it is only the reflective faculty of judgment to which this idea serves as principle): this faculty gives a law only to itself, not to Nature in addition

11973,"Purpose is the Notion, and immanent; not external form and abstraction as distinguished from a fundamental material, but penetrating, so that all that is particular is determined by this universal itself
- HoP 3",211
11977,"But as this consideration is only a subjective manner of representing such products, and does not contain the truth of the same, such things are regarded only according to this unity, and they are not in themselves of this nature; what they are in themselves lies beyond
- HoP 3",278
11978,"The Beautiful of the æsthetic faculty of judgment consists in the following: “Pleasure and displeasure are something subjective, which can in no way become a part of knowledge
- HoP 3",183
11979,"The object has adaptation to end only to the extent that its conception is directly bound up with the feeling of pleasure; and this is an æsthetic conception
- HoP 3",165
11981,"Such a judgment regarding the adaptability to end of the object, a judgment which is grounded on no previous Notion of the object, and furnishes no Notion of it, is an æsthetic judgment
- HoP 3",193
11982,"An object whose form (not the material of its conception as sensation) is judged to be a cause of the pleasure which springs from the conception of such an object, is beautiful,”—the first reasonable thing said about beauty

11983,"The sensuous is one moment of the Beautiful, but it must also express the spiritual, a Notion

11984,"It is related to no inclination, therefore the subject feels itself quite free therein
- HoP 3",94
11985,"It is not beautiful for me
- HoP 3",34
11988,"Because Kant, however, places it in the subject, it is limited, and as æsthetic it also ranks lower, inasmuch as it is not the unity as Notion
- HoP 3",150
11989,"The other manner of bringing harmony to pass is the teleological way of regarding Nature, which is found in the objective and material adaptation to end
- HoP 3",160
11990,"Here the immediate unity of the Notion and reality is looked upon as objective in the organic products of Nature—this being the purpose of Nature, containing in its universality the particular, in its particularity the species
- HoP 3",234
11991,"But such a mode of consideration must be practised not externally, but in conformity with internal teleology
- HoP 3",116
11994,"This is the self-preservation of the living creature; as an individual it is no doubt perishable, but in living it produces itself, although for that purpose certain conditions are requisite
- HoP 3",198
11996,"That is the Aristotelian Notion—the infinite that returns into itself, the Idea
- HoP 3",87
11998,"We regard it as if there dwelt in the sensuous a Notion which brings the particular into conformity with itself
- HoP 3",119
11999,"In the organic products of Nature we perceive this immediate unity of the Notion and reality; for in a living creature there is perceived in one unity the soul, or the universal, and existence or particularity, which is not the case with inorganic Nature
- HoP 3",262
12000,"Thus there enters into the Kantian philosophy the conception of the concrete, as that the universal Notion determines the particular
- HoP 3",140
12002,"He will not therefore throw off his limitations in the moment in which he assumes them as limitations
- HoP 3",109
12003,"This is the perpetual contradiction in Kant’s philosophy: Kant exhibited the extremes of opposition in their one-sidedness, and expressed also the reconciliation of the contradiction; Reason postulates unity, and this we have also in the faculty of judgment
- HoP 3",265
12004,"Kant, however, says (Kritik der Urtheilskraft, pp
- HoP 3",57
12005,"In art it is thus certainly the sensuous mode which gives us the conception of the Idea; reality and ideality are here directly in one
- HoP 3",142
12006,"But at this point also Kant says that we must remain at what is one-sided, at the very moment when he is passing out beyond it
- HoP 3",134
12007,"The wealth of thought therefore still unfolds itself with Kant in subjective form alone; all fulness, all content, concentrates in conceiving, thinking, postulating
- HoP 3",172
12008,"The objective, according to Kant, is only what is in itself; and we know not what Things-in-themselves are
- HoP 3",114
12009,"But Being-in-itself is only the caput mortuum, the dead abstraction of the “other,” the empty, undetermined Beyond
- HoP 3",122
12010,"The reason why that true Idea should not be the truth is therefore that the empty abstractions of an understanding which keeps itself in the abstract universal, and of a sensuous material of individuality standing in opposition to the same, are presupposed as the truth
- HoP 3",277
12015,"In spite of their directly and definitely expressed non-absoluteness, they are yet looked on as true knowledge; and intuitive Understanding, which holds Notion and sensuous perception in one unity, is looked on as a mere thought which we make for ourselves
- HoP 3",264
12017,"This identity of the Good and reality is the demand of practical Reason; but subjective Reason cannot realize this
- HoP 3",122
12018,"In every good action a man no doubt accomplishes something good, but this is only limited; universal Good, as the final object of the world, can be attained to only through a third
- HoP 3",188
12019,"And this power over the world, which has as its final object the Good in the world, is God371 Thus the Critique of the Faculty of Judgment also ends with the postulate of God
- HoP 3",182
12020,"Now, although the particular laws of Nature, as independent individual relations, have no relation to the Good, Reason consists in having and desiring unity as the essential or substantial in itself
- HoP 3",206
12021,"The opposition of these two, the Good and the world, is contrary to that identity; Reason must therefore demand that this contradiction should be abrogated, that there should be a power which is good on its own account, and is a Power over Nature
- HoP 3",254
12022,"This is the position which God assumes in Kant’s philosophy: no proof is possible, he says, of God’s existence, but the demand is there
- HoP 3",143
12024,"Thus, therefore, according to Kant (Kritik der Urtheilskraft, pp
- HoP 3",72
12025,"We associate the faith of Jacobi with this; for in this point Kant agrees with Jacobi372  If now, in accordance with this standpoint of Kant and Jacobi, God is believed in, and we admit this standpoint for an instant, there is certainly a return to the Absolute
- HoP 3",269
12026,"But the question remains: What is God?
- HoP 3",46
12027,"To define Him as supersensuous is not much, nor is it more to say He is universal, abstract, absolute
- HoP 3",109
12028,"What then is His determination?
- HoP 3",39
12029,"But here the furthest point reached is the general statement that God exists with the determination of being infinite, universal, indeterminate
- HoP 3",151
12030,"God cannot be known in this way; for in order to be known He must as concrete possess at least two determinations
- HoP 3",121
12031,"In this way mediation would be established, for a knowledge of the concrete is at once a mediate knowledge
- HoP 3",114
12032,"But this standpoint lacks mediation, and thus remains at the immediate
- HoP 3",78
12033,"Paul, in speaking to the Athenians, appeals to the altar which they had dedicated to the Unknown God, and declares to them what God is; but the standpoint indicated here takes us back to the Unknown God
- HoP 3",210
12034,"All the life of Nature, as of Spirit, is mediation in itself; and to this mediation the philosophy of Schelling now passed on
- HoP 3",133
12035,"If we sum up the Kantian philosophy, we find on all hands the Idea of Thought, which is in itself the absolute Notion, and has in itself difference, reality
- HoP 3",164
12036,"In the theoretic and practical Reason it has only abstract difference, but in the Faculty of Judgment, as the unity of the two, Kant goes so far as to establish the difference as actual, establishing not only particularity, but also individuality
- HoP 3",254
12038,"Therefore actuality counts as something sensuous, empirical, for the comprehension of which Kant takes the categories of the Understanding, giving them the same validity as they have in every-day life
- HoP 3",208
12039,"This is a complete philosophy of the Understanding, which renounces Reason: the reason why it became so popular was the negative one, that men were once for all free from the old metaphysic
- HoP 3",197
12041,"It is otherwise with Jacobi’s faith; he finds the conception of God as immediate existence, and all mediation is untrue for him
- HoP 3",135
12042,"The further result attending this is the autocracy of the subjective Reason, which, seeing that it is abstract and without knowledge, has only subjective certainty and not objective truth
- HoP 3",195
12043,"The second cause of rejoicing was the concession to freedom of a perfect right, which I can neither understand nor justify, and need not do so; my subjective liberty of conviction and certainty holds good all round
- HoP 3",222
12044,"The third cause of joy was added by Jacobi, who said that it amounted even to a crime to seek to know the truth, because the infinite was thereby only rendered finite
- HoP 3",174
12045,"Truth is in a bad way, when all metaphysic is done away with, and the only philosophy acknowledged is not a philosophy at all!
- HoP 3",134
12048,"The first is existence, but in the form of Other-Being for consciousness; for what is only existence is object
- HoP 3",118
12049,"The second is Being-for-self, genuine actuality; here the reverse relation enters in, for self-consciousness, as the negative of Being-in-itself, is itself reality
- HoP 3",171
12050,"The third is the unity of the two; the absolute, self-conscious actuality is the sum of true actuality, into which are re-absorbed both the objective and the independently existent subjective
- HoP 3",199
12051,"Kant has thus made an historical statement of the moments of the whole, and has correctly determined and distinguished them: it is a good introduction to Philosophy
- HoP 3",172
12053,"But thought and thinking had become once for all an absolute requisite that could no longer be set aside
- HoP 3",112
12054,"It was consequently in the first place demanded by consistency that particular thoughts should appear as if produced of necessity from the original unity of the ego, and in that way justified
- HoP 3",199
12057,"It is verily also the essence of revealed religion to know what God is
- HoP 3",78
12059,"The first requirement—consistency—Fichte sought to satisfy; the other—content—Schelling strove to fulfil
- HoP 3",112
12060,"Fichte created a great sensation in his time; his philosophy is the Kantian philosophy in its completion, and, as we must specially notice, it is set forth in a more logical way
- HoP 3",185
12061,"He does not pass beyond the fundamentals of Kant’s philosophy, and at first regarded his own philosophy as no more than a systematic working out of the other373 In addition to these systems of philosophies, and that of Schelling, there are none
- HoP 3",252
12062,"Any that pretend to be such merely pick out something from these, and over this they fight and wrangle among themselves

12065,"But their thoughts are all derived from Fichte, Kant, or Schelling—that is in so far as there are thoughts there present at all
- HoP 3",135
12068,"Johann Gottlieb Fichte was born on the 19th of May, 1762, at Rammenau, near Bischoffswerda, in Upper Lusatia
- HoP 3",116
12069,"He studied at Jena, and for some time was a private tutor in Switzerland
- HoP 3",80
12070,"He wrote a treatise on Religion, termed a “Critique of all Revelation,” where the Kantian phraseology is employed throughout—so much so that it was thought to be the work of Kant
- HoP 3",186
12072,"Fichte might have kept silence, but he published the above-mentioned essay as an introduction to the article
- HoP 3",116
12073,"The authorities wished an investigation to be made into the matter
- HoP 3",74
12074,"Then Fichte wrote a letter which contained threats, and respecting it Goethe said that a Government ought not to allow itself to be threatened
- HoP 3",150
12075,"Fichte now taught privately for some time in Berlin; in 1805 he became professor at Erlangen, and in 1809 at Berlin, at which place he died on the 27th January, 1814374 We cannot here deal more particularly with the details of his life
- HoP 3",243
12077,"In the history of Philosophy, however, such cannot be taken into consideration, although through their matter they may have the highest possible value; the content has to be speculatively developed, and that is done in Fichte’s earlier philosophic works alone375   1
- HoP 3",274
12078,"As we mentioned above (p 478), the shortcoming in the Kantian philosophy was its unthinking inconsistency, through which speculative unity was lacking to the whole system; and this shortcoming was removed by Fichte
- HoP 3",222
12080,"He maintained the ego to be the absolute principle, so that from it, the direct and immediate certainty of self, all the matter in the universe must be represented as produced; hence, according to Fichte, reason is in itself a synthesis of Notion and actuality
- HoP 3",268
12081,"But this principle he once more in an equally one-sided manner set aside; it is from the very beginning subjective, conditioned by an opposite, and its realization is a continual rushing onward in finitude, a looking back at what has gone before
- HoP 3",253
12082,"The form in which it is presented has also the disadvantage, and indeed, the real drawback of bringing the empiric ego ever before one’s eyes, which is absurd, and quite distracting to one’s point of view
- HoP 3",212
12083,"The claims of Philosophy have advanced so far that in the first place self-consciousness refuses any longer to regard absolute essence as immediate substance which does not in itself possess difference, reality, and actuality
- HoP 3",233
12084,"Against this substance self-consciousness ever struggled, for it does not find its explicit Being there, and consequently feels the lack of freedom
- HoP 3",155
12085,"But besides this it demanded that this essence, objectively presented, should be personal, living, self-conscious, actual, and not shut up in abstract metaphysical thoughts alone
- HoP 3",186
12086,"On the other hand consciousness, for which the other is, demanded the moment of external actuality, Being as such, into which thought must pass, truth in objective existence; and this is what we more especially noticed in connection with the English
- HoP 3",257
12089,"This principle is apprehended actuality, for the taking back of the other-Being into self-consciousness is just apprehension
- HoP 3",132
12090,"The Notion of the Notion is from this point of view found in the fact that in what is apprehended self-consciousness has the certainty of itself; what is not apprehended is something foreign to it
- HoP 3",204
12092,"Nothing other than the ego anywhere exists, and the ego is there because it is there; what is there is only in the ego and for the ego377  Now Fichte merely set forth this Notion; he did not bring it to a scientific realization from itself
- HoP 3",247
12093,"For to him this Notion maintains and asserts itself as this Notion; it has absoluteness for him in so far as it is merely the unrealized Notion, and thus indeed comes once more into opposition with reality
- HoP 3",213
12094,"The Fichtian philosophy has the great advantage of having set forth the fact that Philosophy must be a science derived from one supreme principle, from which all determinations are necessarily derived
- HoP 3",208
12096,"Thus Fichte does not, like Kant, throw his work into narrative form because he begins with the ego; but he has proceeded further, inasmuch as he sought to bring about a construction of determinations of knowledge from the ego
- HoP 3",233
12098,"Fichte states that the task of Philosophy is to find a theory of knowledge; universal knowledge is both the object and the starting-point of Philosophy
- HoP 3",159
12099,"Consciousness knows, that is its nature; the end of philosophic learning is the knowledge of this knowledge
- HoP 3",115
12101,"But when I philosophize, I make my ordinary consciousness itself my object, because I make a pure category my consciousness: I know what my ego is doing, and thus I get behind my ordinary consciousness
- HoP 3",209
12102,"Fichte thus defines Philosophy as the artificial consciousness, as the consciousness of consciousness380  a
- HoP 3",115
12103,"Where Fichte in his system has attained the highest degree of determinateness, he begins, as we saw Kant did before (pp
- HoP 3",127
12104,"Ego is there a fact, says Fichte, but not yet a proposition
- HoP 3",67
12105,"As proposition, as principle, the ego must not remain barren, nor be accepted as one, for to a proposition pertains a synthesis
- HoP 3",135
12106,"Now Fichte proceeds in his system from the fact that Philosophy must begin with an absolutely unconditioned, certain principle, with something indubitably certain in ordinary knowledge
- HoP 3",192
12108,"It must have a principle which can neither be proved from it nor from another science; for it is supreme
- HoP 3",112
12111,"The Being of the ego is not a dead, but a concrete Being; but the highest Being is thought
- HoP 3",98
12112,"Ego, as an explicitly self-existent activity of thought, is thus knowledge, even if it is only abstract knowledge, as in the beginning at least it cannot help being
- HoP 3",172
12113,"At the same time Fichte begins from this absolute certainty with quite other necessities and demands; for from this ego not only Being but also the larger system of thought has to be derived (supra, p 230)
- HoP 3",213
12114,"According to Fichte, the ego is the source of the categories and ideas, but all conceptions and thoughts are a manifold reduced to a synthesis through Thought
- HoP 3",166
12115,"Thus while with Descartes in connection with the ego other thoughts appear which we simply find already in us, such as God, nature, &c, Fichte sought for a philosophy entirely of a piece, in which nothing empiric was to be admitted from without
- HoP 3",252
12116,"The ego is certain, it cannot be doubted; but Philosophy desires to reach the truth
- HoP 3",91
12117,"The certainty is subjective, and because it is made to remain the basis, all else remains subjective also without there being any possibility of this form being removed
- HoP 3",176
12118,"Fichte now analyzes the ego, reducing it to three principles from which the whole of knowledge has to be evolved
- HoP 3",120
12119,"The first proposition must be simple, in it predicate and subject must be alike; for were they unlike, their connection—since in accordance with their diversity the determinations are not directly one—would have to be first of all proved by means of a third
- HoP 3",265
12120,"The first principle must thus be identical
- HoP 3",50
12121,"Fichte now proceeds further to distinguish in this first principle the form and content; but in order that this same may be immediately true through itself, form and content must be again the same, and the principle conditioned by neither
- HoP 3",246
12122,"It signifies A = A, the abstract undetermined identity; that is the proposition of contradiction, wherein A is an indifferent content
- HoP 3",141
12123,"Fichte says, “Thought is by no means essence, but only a particular determination of Being; there are outside of it many other determinations of our Being
- HoP 3",162
12124,"I merely remark this, that when ‘I am’ is overstepped, Spinozism is necessarily reached
- HoP 3",95
12125,"Its unity is something which ought to be produced through us, but which cannot be so; it is not anything that is” The first proposition is then that I am identical with myself, Ego = Ego;384 that undoubtedly is the definition of the ego
- HoP 3",244
12126,"The subject and the predicate are the content; and this content of the two sides is likewise their relation, ie form
- HoP 3",124
12127,"Relation requires two sides; the relating and the related are here, however, the same; for on account of the simplicity of the ego, there is nothing but a relation of the ego to the ego
- HoP 3",193
12128,"I have knowledge of myself; but in so far as I am consciousness, I know of an object which is different from me, and which is then likewise mine
- HoP 3",152
12129,"But the ego is in such a way identical with its difference that what is different is immediately the same, and what is identical is likewise different; we have a difference without a difference
- HoP 3",201
12130,"Self-consciousness is not dead identity, or non-Being, but the object which is identical with me
- HoP 3",104
12131,"This is immediately certain; all else must be as certain to me, inasmuch as it must be my relation to myself
- HoP 3",116
12132,"The content must be transformed into the ego, so that in it I have my determination alone
- HoP 3",97
12134,"In the second place, this principle is indeed the immediate certainty of self-consciousness, but self-consciousness is likewise consciousness, and in it there is likewise the certainty that other things exist to which it stands in an attitude of opposition
- HoP 3",264
12135,"In the third place, that principle has not the truth in it, for the very reason that the certainty of itself possessed by the ego has no objectivity; it has not the form of the differentiated content within it—or it stands in opposition to the consciousness of an “other”
- HoP 3",279
12138,"We might say that through this content the proposition is independent, since the negative therein is an absolute, as truly as the reverse—that it is independent through the form of opposition which cannot be derived from the original
- HoP 3",241
12139,"Here, then, we have no more to do with derivation, although this derivation of opposition from the first proposition was all the same demanded
- HoP 3",150
12140,"Inasmuch as I posit another in opposition to the ego, I posit myself as not posited; this non-ego is the object generally, ie that which is opposed to me
- HoP 3",161
12141,"This other is the negative of the ego; thus when Fichte called it the non-ego he was expressing himself in a very happy, suitable, and consistent manner
- HoP 3",160
12142,"There has been a good deal of ridicule cast on the ego and non-ego; the expression is new, and therefore to us Germans it seems strange at first
- HoP 3",152
12143,"But the French say Moi and Non-moi, without finding anything laughable in it
- HoP 3",84
12144,"In this principle the positing belongs, however, to the ego; but because the non-ego is independent of the ego, we have two sides, and self-consciousness relates itself to another
- HoP 3",187
12145,"This second proposition thus signifies that I posit myself as limited, as non-ego; but non-ego is something quite new to be added
- HoP 3",137
12146,"On the one side we thus have before us a field which is merely appropriated from the ego; and in this way we have before us the non-ego as our object
- HoP 3",157
12147,"To these is added yet a third proposition, in which I now make this division into ego and non-ego: it is the synthetic principle, the proposition of ground, which in content is unconditioned, just as in the second was the case in regard to form
- HoP 3",252
12148,"This third proposition is the determination of the first two through one another, in such a way that the ego limits the non-ego
- HoP 3",135
12149,"I posit the non-ego, which is for me, in myself, in my identity with myself; thus I take it from its non-identity, its not-being-I, that is to say I limit it
- HoP 3",165
12151,"The whole sphere which I have before me is supposed indeed to be the ego, but in it I have not one but two
- HoP 3",114
12152,"The proposition of ground is thus the relation of reality and negation, ie it is limitation; it contains the ego limited by the non-ego, and the non-ego limited by the ego386 Of this synthesis there is nothing, properly speaking, contained in the two earlier propositions
- HoP 3",279
12153,"Even this first presentation of the three principles does away with the immanence of real knowledge
- HoP 3",107
12154,"Thus the presentation is here also subject to an opposite from the first, as it is with Kant, even if these are two acts of the ego merely, and we remain entirely in the ego
- HoP 3",181
12155,"Now that limitation may take place for me in two different ways: at one time the one is passive, at another time the other is so
- HoP 3",136
12156,"In this limitation the ego may posit the non-ego as limiting and itself as limited, in such a way that the ego posits itself as requiring to have an object; I know myself indeed as ego, but determined by the non-ego; non-ego is here active and ego passive
- HoP 3",263
12157,"Or, on the other hand, the ego, as abrogating other-being, is that which limits, and non-ego is the limited
- HoP 3",115
12158,"I know myself then as clearly determining the non-ego, as the absolute cause of the non-ego as such, for I can think
- HoP 3",124
12160,"The theoretic proposition is that the object is before me and it determines me
- HoP 3",86
12161,"The ego is, since I perceive, a content, and I have this content in me, which is thus outside of me
- HoP 3",107
12162,"This is on the whole the same thing as we meet with in the experience of Kant: it comes to the same thing whether it is by matter or the non-ego that the ego is here determined
- HoP 3",184
12163,"In the theoretic consciousness the ego, although the assertive generally, finds itself limited by the non-ego
- HoP 3",117
12164,"But it is identical with itself; hence its infinite activity ever sets itself to abrogate the non-ego and to bring forth itself
- HoP 3",135
12165,"Now the different methods whereby the ego sets forth itself are the different methods of its activity; these we have to understand in their necessity
- HoP 3",157
12166,"But since philosophic knowledge is the consideration of consciousness itself (supra, p 483), I can only know knowledge, the act of the ego
- HoP 3",146
12167,"Fichte thus appeals to consciousness, postulates ego and non-ego in their abstraction, and since philosophic knowledge is the consciousness of consciousness, it is not sufficient that I should find its determinations in consciousness, for I produce them with consciousness
- HoP 3",280
12168,"Common consciousness, indeed, likewise brings forth all the determinations of the ordinary conception and of thought, but without—on the theoretic side at least—having any knowledge of it; for it is the fact of being limited alone that is present to it
- HoP 3",260
12169,"Thus, when I see a large square object, such as a wall, my ordinary consciousness accepts these determinations as they are given to it; the object is
- HoP 3",157
12171,"The ego thus posits itself as that which is limited by the non-ego
- HoP 3",74
12172,"I make this limitation mine; thus is it for me in me, this passivity of the ego is itself the activity of the ego
- HoP 3",121
12173,"As a matter of fact, all reality which appears in the object for the ego is a determination of the ego,389 just as the categories and other determinations were in Kant’s case
- HoP 3",182
12174,"Thus it is here more especially that we should expect Fichte to demonstrate the return of other-Being into absolute consciousness
- HoP 3",137
12175,"However, because after all the other-Being was regarded as unconditioned, as implicit, this return does not come to pass
- HoP 3",128
12176,"The ego determines the ‘other,’ indeed, but this unity is an altogether finite unity; non-ego has thus immediately escaped from determination once more and gone forth from this unity
- HoP 3",190
12178,"These particular thought-determinations he calls categories, and he seeks to demonstrate them in their necessity; from the time of Aristotle onwards no one had thought of so doing
- HoP 3",187
12182,"The ego is so far the ideal ground of all conceptions of the object; all determination of this object is a determination of the ego
- HoP 3",139
12183,"But in order that it may be object, it must be placed in opposition to the ego, ie the determinations set forth through the ego are another, the non-ego; this placing of the object in opposition is the real ground of conceptions
- HoP 3",236
12184,"The ego is, however, likewise the real ground of the object; for it is likewise a determination of the ego that the non-ego as object is set in opposition to the ego
- HoP 3",173
12185,"Both, the real ground and the ideal ground of the conception, are thus one and the same392 Regarding the ego as ideal principle and the non-ego as real principle, Krug has likewise talked a great deal of nonsense
- HoP 3",220
12186,"Regarded from the one point of view, the ego is active and the non-ego purely passive; while from the other side the ego is passive and the object active and operative
- HoP 3",175
12187,"But since the ego in the non-philosophic consciousness does not have the consciousness of its activity in the conception of the object, it represents to itself its own activity as foreign, ie as belonging to the non-ego
- HoP 3",227
12189,"If one occupies oneself only with this content, that form of subjectivity which is dominant with Fichte, and which remains in his opposition, disappears
- HoP 3",160
12190,"As the ego is affirmative and determining, there now is in this determination a negative likewise present; I find myself determined and at the same time the ego is like itself, infinite, ie identical with itself
- HoP 3",219
12191,"This is a contradiction which Fichte indeed endeavours to reconcile, but in spite of it all he leaves the false basis of dualism undisturbed
- HoP 3",148
12192,"The ultimate, beyond which Fichte does not get, is only an ‘ought,’ which does not solve the contradiction; for while the ego should be absolutely at home with itself, ie free, it should at the same time be associated with another
- HoP 3",238
12194,"To speak of the bounds of human reason is, however, an unmeaning form of words
- HoP 3",86
12195,"That the reason of the subject is limited is comprehensible from the nature of the case, but when we speak of Thought, infinitude is none other than one’s own relation to self, and not to one’s limit; and the place in which man is infinite is Thought
- HoP 3",258
12196,"Infinitude may then be likewise very abstract, and in this way it is also once more finite; but true infinitude remains in itself
- HoP 3",137
12198,"In order that a fixed determination may exist between the two, I have to make the limit a permanent one, and we have that in the understanding
- HoP 3",150
12199,"All further determinations of the object are, as categories of the understanding, modes of synthesis; but each synthesis is a new contradiction
- HoP 3",151
12200,"New mediations are thus once more necessary, and these are new determinations
- HoP 3",85
12201,"Thus Fichte says: I can always continue to determine the non-ego, to make it my conception, ie to take from it its negation as regards me
- HoP 3",145
12202,"I have to deal with my activity alone; but there is always an externality therein present which still remains, and which is not explained by my activity
- HoP 3",160
12204,"Everything determinate which the ego possesses it has through its own positing; I even make a coat or a boot because I put them on
- HoP 3",138
12205,"There remains only the empty repulsive force, and that is the Kantian Thing-in-itself, beyond which even Fichte cannot get, even though the theoretic reason continues its determination into infinitude
- HoP 3",208
12206,"In it we have not therefore to deal with the truth in and for itself, but with a contingent, because ego is limited, not absolute, as its Notion demands: intelligence is not here considered as spirit which is free
- HoP 3",221
12207,"This is Fichte’s standpoint as regards the theoretic side
- HoP 3",65
12208,"The ego is thus infinite activity, and, as ego = ego, the absolute ego, it is undoubtedly abstract
- HoP 3",106
12209,"But in order to have a determination, a non-ego must exist; ego is thus activity, causality, the positing of the non-ego
- HoP 3",128
12210,"But as with Kant sensuousness and reason remain opposed, the same contradiction is present here, only in a more abstract form, and not in the rude empiricism of Kant
- HoP 3",173
12211,"Fichte here turns and twists in all sorts of ways, or he gives the opposition many different forms; the crudest form is that ego is posited as causality, for in it another is necessitated on which it exercises its activity
- HoP 3",230
12212,"Hence the ego in its essence would be contradictory and self-repellent; there would be in it a two-fold or contradictory principle, which assumption contradicts itself, for in that case there would be no principle within it
- HoP 3",231
12213,"The ego would” consequently “not exist, for it would abrogate itself
- HoP 3",76
12214,"All contradictions are reconciled through the further determination of contradictory propositions
- HoP 3",105
12215,"The ego must be posited in one sense as infinite, and in another as finite
- HoP 3",82
12216,"Were it to be posited as infinite and finite in one and the same sense, the contradiction would be insoluble; the ego would not be one but two
- HoP 3",150
12217,"In so far as the ego posits itself as infinite, its activity is directed upon itself and on nothing else but itself
- HoP 3",123
12219,"I am called upon to proceed to determine the other in relation to which I am negative, the non-ego, in accordance with my freedom; it has indeed all determinations through the activity of the ego, but beyond my determination the same non-ego ever continues to appear
- HoP 3",274
12220,"The ego clearly posits an object, a point of limitation, but where the limitation is, is undetermined
- HoP 3",109
12221,"I may transfer the sphere of my determination, and extend it to an infinite degree, but there always remains a pure Beyond, and the non-ego has no positive self-existent determination
- HoP 3",191
12222,"The last point in respect of the practical sphere is hence this, that the activity of the ego is a yearning or striving397—like the Kantian “ought”; Fichte treats this with great prolixity
- HoP 3",196
12223,"The Fichtian philosophy consequently has the same standpoint as the Kantian; the ultimate is always subjectivity, as existent in and for itself
- HoP 3",151
12224,"Yearning, according to Fichte, is divine; in yearning I have not forgotten myself, I have not forgotten that I possess a superiority in myself; and therefore it is a condition of happiness and satisfaction
- HoP 3",213
12225,"This infinite yearning and desire has then been regarded as what is highest and most excellent in the Beautiful, and in religious feelings likewise; and with it is connected the irony of which we have spoken before (Vol
- HoP 3",227
12226,"In this return the ego is merely an effort, on its side it is fixed, and it cannot realize its endeavours
- HoP 3",113
12227,"Striving is thus an imperfect or implicitly limited action
- HoP 3",66
12230,"Or the ego does not comprehend the infinite repulsion, the non-ego; self-consciousness determines the non-ego, but does not know how to make this Beyond its own
- HoP 3",168
12232,"Hence, if the ego was ever called absolute existence, the most terrible offence was given, because really the ego only came before us as signifying the individual subject as opposed to the universal
- HoP 3",206
12233,"This he worked out in his popular writings
- HoP 3",50
12234,"For because the ego is fixed in its opposition to the non-ego, and is only as being opposed, it becomes lost in that unity
- HoP 3",130
12236,"The Fichtian philosophy recognizes the finite spirit alone, and not the infinite; it does not recognize spirit as universal thought, as the Kantian philosophy does not recognize the not-true; or it is formal
- HoP 3",215
12239,"This union of faith he likewise finds in the Love of God
- HoP 3",64
12240,"As believed and experienced, this form pertains to Religion, and not to Philosophy, and our only possible interest is to know this in Philosophy
- HoP 3",152
12241,"But with Fichte it is still associated with a most unsatisfying externality of which the basis is the non-Idea, for the one determination is essential only because the other is so, and so on into infinitude
- HoP 3",214
12242,"But it asserts nothing more than this opposed power, which by finite beings can merely be felt and not known
- HoP 3",116
12244,"This knowledge, however, is not transcendent but transcendental
- HoP 3",71
12246,"Every thing is, in its ideality, dependent upon the ego; but in its reality even the ego is dependent
- HoP 3",109
12249,"The absolute point of view, like an absolute content, is wanting
- HoP 3",72
12250,"Thus the contemplation of nature, for instance, is a contemplation of it as of pure finitenesses from the point of view of another, as though the organic body were regarded thus: “Consciousness requires a sphere entirely its own for its activity
- HoP 3",253
12251,"This sphere is posited through an original, necessary activity of the ego, in which it does not know itself as free
- HoP 3",123
12252,"It is a sensuous perception, a drawing of lines; the sphere of activity thereby becomes something extended in space
- HoP 3",123
12253,"As quiescent, continuous, and yet unceasingly changing, this sphere is matter, which, as body, has a number of parts which in relation to one another are called limbs
- HoP 3",174
12254,"The person can ascribe to himself no body without positing it as being under the influence of another person
- HoP 3",116
12256,"For “my body is my body and not that of another; it must further operate and be active without my working through it
- HoP 3",124
12257,"It is only through the operation of another that I can myself be active and represent myself as a rational being who can be respected by him
- HoP 3",148
12258,"But the other being should treat me immediately as a rational being, I should be for him a rational being even before my activity begins
- HoP 3",144
12259,"Or my form must produce an effect through its mere existence in space, without my activity, ie it must be visible
- HoP 3",121
12260,"The reciprocal operation of rational beings must take place without activity; thus a subtle matter must be assumed in order that it may be modified by means of the merely quiescent form
- HoP 3",193
12262,"This is how it is put: Man must eat, and thus there must be something edible—consequently plants and animals are at once deduced; plants must have their root in something, and consequently the earth is forthwith deduced
- HoP 3",227
12263,"In this way the animal organism appears as a tough, tenacious matter which is “articulated” and can be modified; light is a subtle matter which is the medium of communication of mere existence, &c—just as in the other case plants and animals are merely edible
- HoP 3",267
12264,"As regards a philosophic consideration of the content there is nothing at all to be found
- HoP 3",97
12265,"Fichte likewise wrote both a Science of Morals and of Natural Rights, but he treats them as sciences pertaining to the understanding only, and his method of procedure is destitute of ideas and carried on by means of a limited understanding
- HoP 3",247
12266,"The Fichtian deduction of the conceptions of justice and morality thus remains within the limitations and rigidity of self-consciousness, as against which Fichte’s popular presentations of religion and morality present inconsistencies
- HoP 3",242
12267,"The treatise on Natural Rights is a special failure, eg where he, as we have just seen (p 502), deduces even nature just as far as he requires it
- HoP 3",153
12269,"Kant began to ground Right upon Freedom, and Fichte likewise makes freedom the principle in the Rights of Nature; but, as was the case with Rousseau, it is freedom in the form of the isolated individual

12270,"This is a great commencement, but in order to arrive at the particular, they have to accept certain hypotheses

12281,"Formerly men of business, statesmen, occupied themselves with Philosophy; now, however, with the intricate idealism of the philosophy of Kant, their wings droop helpless to the ground
- HoP 3",191
12282,"Hence it is with Kant that we first begin to find a line of separation which parts us from the common modes of consciousness; but the result, that the Absolute cannot be known, has become one generally acknowledged
- HoP 3",222
12283,"With Fichte the common consciousness has still further separated itself from Philosophy, and it has utterly departed from the speculative element therein present

- HoP 3",230
12296,"In Fichte’s case the limitation is continually re-appearing; but because the ego feels constrained to break through this barrier, it reacts against it, and gives itself a resting-place within itself; this last ought to be concrete, but it is a negative resting-place alone

12356,"Here he likewise starts to a certain measure, though unconsciously, from the Fichtian form of construction; but the idea is already present that nature equally with knowledge is a system of reason
- HoP 3",204
12357,"It is not feasible here to go into details respecting what is called the philosophy of Schelling, even if time permitted
- HoP 3",128
12358,"For it is not yet a scientific whole organized in all its branches, since it rather consists in certain general elements which do not fluctuate with the rest of his opinions
- HoP 3",181
12359,"Schelling’s philosophy must still be regarded as in process of evolution, and it has not yet ripened into fruit;416 we can hence give a general idea of it only
- HoP 3",167
12360,"When Schelling made his first appearance the demands put forward by Philosophy were as follows
- HoP 3",102
12361,"With Descartes thought and extension were in some incomprehensible way united in God, with Spinoza it was as motionless substance; and beyond this point of view neither of them ever passed
- HoP 3",196
12362,"Later on we saw the form develop, partly in the sciences and partly in the Kantian philosophy
- HoP 3",101
12363,"Finally, in the Fichtian philosophy, the form was subjectivity on its own account, from which all determinations were held to develop
- HoP 3",141
12364,"What is thus demanded is that this subjectivity of infinite form which we saw dying into irony or arbitrariness (pp
- HoP 3",123
12365,"To put it otherwise, the substance of Spinoza should not be apprehended as the unmoved, but as the intelligent, as a form which possesses activity within itself of necessity, so that it is the forming power of nature, but at the same time knowledge and comprehension
- HoP 3",274
12366,"This then is the object of Philosophy; it is not the formal union of Spinoza that is demanded, nor the subjective totality of Fichte, but totality with the infinite form
- HoP 3",177
12367,"We see this developing in the philosophy of Schelling
- HoP 3",61
12368,"In one of his earlier writings, the “System of Transcendental Idealism,” which we shall consider first of all, Schelling represented transcendental philosophy and natural philosophy as the two sides of scientific knowledge
- HoP 3",230
12371,"This is the meaning of the effort to connect natural phenomena with theory
- HoP 3",82
12372,"The highest perfection of natural science would be the perfect spiritualization of all natural laws into laws of intuitive perception and thought
- HoP 3",153
12373,"The phenomenal (the material element) must entirely disappear, and laws (the formal element) alone remain
- HoP 3",113
12374,"Hence it comes to pass that the more that which is in conformity with law breaks forth in nature itself, the more the outward covering disappears; the phenomena themselves become more spiritual, and finally cease altogether
- HoP 3",231
12375,"The perfect theory of nature would be that by which the whole of nature should be resolved into an intelligence
- HoP 3",119
12378,"Through this tendency to make nature intelligent natural science becomes the philosophy of nature” The intelligent character of nature is thus spoken of as a postulate of science
- HoP 3",186
12379,"The other point of view is “to give the subjective the foremost place” Thus here “the problem is how to add an objective element agreeing with it
- HoP 3",153
12382,"But the true process could only be traced out by means of logic, for it contains pure thoughts; but the logical point of view was what Schelling never arrived at in his presentation of things
- HoP 3",199
12383,"But does A exist?
- HoP 3",25
12384,"The ego is “the point where subject and object are one in their unmediated condition”; the ego is just Ego = Ego, subject-object; and that is the act of self-consciousness wherein I am for myself object to myself
- HoP 3",220
12385,"In self-consciousness there is not to be found a distinction between me and anything else; what are distinguished are directly identical, and there is so far nothing at all in opposition to this self-consciousness
- HoP 3",221
12386,"How the case stands with regard to external objects is the question which must be decided later, in the further course of development
- HoP 3",141
12389,"Now intellectual intuition is the organ of all transcendental thought,” the act of pure self-consciousness generally
- HoP 3",124
12390,"Science can start from nothing objective,” but from “the non-objective which itself becomes object” as an “original duplicity
- HoP 3",133
12393,"Intellectual intuition is the Fichtian imagination oscillating between two different points
- HoP 3",99
12394,"But the immediate knowledge of God as spiritual is only in the consciousness of Christian nations, and not for others
- HoP 3",125
12395,"This immediate knowledge appears to be still more contingent as the intellectual intuition of the concrete, or the identity of subjectivity and objectivity
- HoP 3",163
12396,"This intuition is intellectual indeed, because it is a rational intuition, and as knowledge it is likewise absolutely one with the object of knowledge
- HoP 3",158
12397,"But this intuition, although itself knowledge, is not as yet known; it is the unmediated, the postulated
- HoP 3",112
12398,"As it is in this way an immediate we must possess it, and what may be possessed may likewise not be possessed
- HoP 3",117
12400,"For the immediate, the intuitively perceived, is in the form of an existent, and is not thus an essential; and whoever does not understand the intellectual intuition must come to the conclusion that he does not possess it
- HoP 3",229
12401,"Or else, in order to understand it, men must give themselves the trouble of possessing it; but no one can tell whether he has it or not—not even from understanding it, for we may merely think we understand it
- HoP 3",216
12402,"Philosophy, however, is in its own nature capable of being universal; for its ground-work is thought, and it is through thought that man is man
- HoP 3",151
12405,"Even less than Fichte did Schelling attain to popularity (supra, pp
- HoP 3",75
12407,"It pertains to the standpoint of the understanding to divide and to distinguish, and to maintain the finite thought-determinations in their opposition; but Philosophy demands that these different thoughts should be brought together
- HoP 3",239
12409,"With Schelling the speculative form has thus again come to the front, and philosophy has again obtained a special character of its own; the principle of Philosophy, rational thought in itself, has obtained the form of thought
- HoP 3",233
12410,"In the philosophy of Schelling the content, the truth, has once more become the matter of chief importance, whereas in the Kantian philosophy the point of interest was more especially stated to be the necessity for investigating subjective knowledge
- HoP 3",257
12411,"This is the standpoint of Schelling’s philosophy in its general aspects
- HoP 3",79
12412,"Since in further analysis the distinction between subject and object comes into view and is accepted, there follows the relationship of the ego to its other; with Fichte that forms the second proposition, in which the self-limitation of the ego is posited
- HoP 3",263
12413,"The ego posits itself in opposition to itself, since it posits itself as conditioned by the non-ego; that is the infinite repulsion, for this conditionment is the ego itself
- HoP 3",181
12414,"Schelling, on the one hand, says: “The ego is unlimited as the ego only in so far as it is limited,” as it relates to the non-ego
- HoP 3",137
12415,"Only thus does consciousness exist, self-consciousness is a barren determination; through its intuition of self the ego becomes finite to itself
- HoP 3",152
12416,"On the other hand it is said: “The ego is limited only in so far as it is unlimited;” this limitation is thus necessary in order to be able to get beyond it
- HoP 3",164
12417,"The contradiction which we find here remains even if the ego always limits the non-ego
- HoP 3",94
12418,"Idealism reflects merely on the one, realism on the other, transcendental idealism on both”419 All this is a tangled mass of abstractions
- HoP 3",145
12420,"In order that it may be complete, the whole inward and outward nature must be presented in all its details: but Philosophy can only set forth the epochs which are most important
- HoP 3",185
12421,"It is the intuitive understanding of Kant, the intelligent intuition or intuitively perceiving intelligence; Schelling, indeed, definitely names this absolute unity of contradictions intellectual intuition
- HoP 3",213
12423,"That it can no more be comprehended through Notions Begriffe than set forth, requires no proof” Notion to Schelling signifies a category of the ordinary understanding; Notion is, however, the concrete thought which in itself is infinite
- HoP 3",244
12427,"This is the highest form of the objectivization of reason, because in it sensuous conception is united with intellectuality, sensuous existence is merely the expression of spirituality
- HoP 3",192
12428,"The highest objectivity which the subject attains, the highest identity of subjective and objective, is that which Schelling terms the power of imagination
- HoP 3",163
12429,"Art is thus comprehended as what is inmost and highest, that which produces the intellectual and real in one, and philosophizing is conceived as this genius of art
- HoP 3",171
12430,"But art and power of imagination are not supreme
- HoP 3",56
12431,"For the Idea, spirit, cannot be truly given expression to in the manner in which art expresses its Idea
- HoP 3",111
12432,"This last is always a method pertaining to intuitive perception; and on account of this sensuous form of existence the work of art cannot correspond to the spirit
- HoP 3",170
12433,"Thus because the point last arrived at is designated as the faculty of imagination, as art, even in the subject this is a subordinate point of view, and thus in itself this point is not the absolute identity of subjectivity and objectivity
- HoP 3",247
12434,"In subjective thought, rational, speculative thought is thus indeed demanded, but if this appears false to you nothing farther can be said than that you do not possess intellectual intuition
- HoP 3",198
12435,"The proving of anything, the making it comprehensible, is thus abandoned; a correct apprehension of it is directly demanded, and the Idea is thus assertorically pre-established as principle
- HoP 3",197
12436,"The Absolute is the absolute identity of subjective and objective, the absolute indifference of real and ideal, of form and essence, of universal and particular; in this identity of the two there is neither the one nor the other
- HoP 3",236
12437,"But the unity is not abstract, empty, and dry; that would signify logical identity, classification according to something common to both, in which the difference remains all the while outside
- HoP 3",199
12438,"The identity is concrete: it is subjectivity as well as objectivity; the two are present therein as abrogated and ideal
- HoP 3",127
12439,"This identity may easily be shown in the ordinary conception: the conception, we may for example say, is subjective; it has, too, the determinate content of exclusion in reference to other conceptions; nevertheless, the conception is simple—it is one act, one unity
- HoP 3",273
12440,"Schelling often uses Spinoza’s form of procedure, and sets up axioms
- HoP 3",76
12441,"In philosophy, when we desire to establish a position, we demand proof
- HoP 3",78
12442,"But if we begin with intellectual intuition, that constitutes an oracle to which we have to give way, since the existence of intellectual intuition was made our postulate
- HoP 3",178
12444,"Similarly in the finite, it would have to be shown that it contained a contradiction in itself, and made itself infinite; in this way we should have the unity of finite and infinite
- HoP 3",189
12446,"The result of thinking contemplation would in this former case be that each moment would secretly make itself into its opposite, the identity of both being alone the truth
- HoP 3",179
12447,"The understanding certainly calls this transformation sophistry, humbug, juggling, and what-not
- HoP 3",103
12448,"As a result, this identity would, according to Jacobi, be one which was no doubt conditioned and of set purpose produced
- HoP 3",128
12449,"But we must remark that a one-sided point of view is involved in apprehending the result of development merely as a result; it is a process which is likewise mediation within itself, of such a nature that this mediation is again abrogated and asserted as immediate
- HoP 3",272
12450,"Schelling, indeed, had this conception in a general way, but he did not follow it out in a definite logical method, for with him it remained an immediate truth, which can only be verified by means of intellectual intuition
- HoP 3",230
12451,"That is the great difficulty in the philosophy of Schelling
- HoP 3",67
12452,"And then it was misunderstood and all interest taken from it
- HoP 3",68
12453,"It is easy enough to show that subjective and objective are different
- HoP 3",77
12454,"Were they not different, nothing could be made of them any more than of A = A; but they are in opposition as one
- HoP 3",120
12456,"To this principle of Schelling’s, form, or necessity, is thus lacking, it is only asserted
- HoP 3",98
12457,"Schelling appears to have this in common with Plato and the Neo-Platonists, that knowledge is to be found in the inward intuition of eternal Ideas wherein knowledge is unmediated in the Absolute
- HoP 3",202
12459,"The Absolute is itself to be looked at as this movement of self-abrogation; this is the only actual knowledge and knowledge of the Absolute
- HoP 3",147
12460,"With Schelling this idea has, however, no dialectic present in it whereby those opposites may determine themselves to pass over into their unity, and in so doing to be comprehended
- HoP 3",188
12462,"But if that method be once adopted, the procedure is not immanent development from the speculative Idea, but it follows the mode of external reflection
- HoP 3",159
12463,"Schelling’s proofs are adduced in such an exceedingly formal manner that they really invariably presuppose the very thing that was to be proved
- HoP 3",151
12464,"The axiom assumes the main point in question, and all the rest follows as a matter of course
- HoP 3",100
12465,"Here is an instance: “The innermost essence of the Absolute can only be thought of as identity absolute, altogether pure and undisturbed
- HoP 3",144
12466,"For the Absolute is only absolute, and what is thought in it is necessarily and invariably the same, or in other words, is necessarily and invariably absolute
- HoP 3",166
12467,"If the idea of the Absolute were a general Notion” (or conception), “this would not prevent a difference being met with in it, notwithstanding this unity of the absolute
- HoP 3",177
12468,"For things the most different are yet in the Notion always one and identical, just as a rectangle, a polygon and a circle are all figures
- HoP 3",145
12469,"The possibility of the difference of all things in association with perfect unity in the Notion lies in the manner in which the particular in them is combined with the universal
- HoP 3",185
12470,"In the Absolute this altogether disappears, because it pertains to the very idea of the Absolute that the particular in it is also the universal, and the universal the particular; and further that by means of this unity form and existence are also one in it
- HoP 3",265
12472,"Here, like Spinoza, he employed the method of geometry, laying down axioms and proving by means of propositions, then going on to deduce other propositions from these, and so on
- HoP 3",185
12473,"But this method has no real application to philosophy
- HoP 3",61
12474,"Schelling at this point laid down certain forms of difference, to which he gave the name of potencies, adopting the term from Eschenmayer, who made use of it (p 514);423 they are ready-made differences, which Schelling avails himself of
- HoP 3",244
12475,"But philosophy must not take any forms from other sciences, as here from mathematics
- HoP 3",92
12476,"With Schelling, the leading form is that which was brought into remembrance again by Kant, the form of triplicity as first, second, and third potency
- HoP 3",157
12479,"But the expression “indifference” is ambiguous, for it means indifference in regard to both the one and the other; and thus it appears as if the content of indifference, the only thing which makes it concrete, were indifferent
- HoP 3",234
12480,"Schelling’s next requirement is that the subject must not be hampered with reflection; that would be bringing it under the determination of the understanding, which, equally with sensuous perception, implies the separateness of sensuous things
- HoP 3",251
12482,"For no qualitative difference as regards the two is thinkable,” because absolute identity “is posited as subject and object only as regards the form of its Being, not as regards its existence
- HoP 3",199
12483,"There is consequently only a quantitative difference left,” ie only that of magnitude: and yet difference must really be understood as qualitative, and must thus be shown to be a difference which abrogates itself
- HoP 3",220
12484,"This quantitative difference, says Schelling, is the form actu: “The quantitative difference of subjective and objective is the basis of all finitude
- HoP 3",157
12485,"Each determined potency marks a determined quantitative difference of the subjective and objective
- HoP 3",106
12486,"Each individual Being is the result of a quantitative difference of subjectivity and objectivity
- HoP 3",104
12488,"Quantitative difference is no true difference, but an entirely external relation; and likewise the preponderance of subjective and objective is not a determination of thought, but a merely sensuous determination
- HoP 3",219
12489,"The Absolute itself, in so far as the positing of difference is taken into account, is defined by Schelling as the quantitative indifference of subjective and objective: in respect to absolute identity no quantitative difference is thinkable
- HoP 3",249
12490,"There is nothing in itself outside of totality, excepting by virtue of an arbitrary separation of the individual from the whole
- HoP 3",135
12492,"From this standpoint A exists just as much as B does; for A like B is the whole absolute identity, which only exists under the two forms, but under both of them alike
- HoP 3",174
12493,"Absolute identity is the universe itself
- HoP 3",48
12495,"The first potency is that the first quantitative difference of the Absolute, or “the first relative totality is matter
- HoP 3",126
12496,"Proof: A = B is not anything real either as relative identity or as relative duplicity
- HoP 3",94
12497,"As identity A = B, in the individual as in the whole, can be expressed only by the line,”—the first dimension
- HoP 3",117
12498,"Relative identity and duplicity are contained in relative totality, not indeed actu, but yet potentia
- HoP 3",109
12499,"Therefore the two opposites must mutually extinguish each other in a third” dimension
- HoP 3",93
12500,"If A preponderates we have the force of attraction, if B preponderates we have that of expansion
- HoP 3",104
12501,"The quantitative positing of the forces of attraction and expansion passes into the infinite; their equilibrium exists in the whole, not in the individual”427 From matter as the first indifference in immediacy Schelling now passes on to further determinations
- HoP 3",267
12502,"The second potency (A²) is light, this identity itself posited as existent; in so far as A = B, A² is also posited
- HoP 3",122
12503,"The same identity, “posited under the form of relative identity,” ie of the polarity which we find appearing “in A and B, is the force of cohesion
- HoP 3",154
12506,"Towards the negative side” (or pole) “fall some of the metals which stand next to iron, after them the so-called precious metals,” then the “diamond, and lastly carbon, the greatest passive cohesion
- HoP 3",206
12507,"Towards the positive side, again, some metals fall, in which the cohesive nature of iron gradually diminishes,” ie approaches disintegration, and lastly “disappears in nitrogen” Active cohesion is magnetism, and the material universe is an infinite magnet
- HoP 3",263
12508,"The magnetic process is difference in indifference, and indifference in difference, and therefore absolute identity as such
- HoP 3",131
12509,"The indifference point of the magnet is the “neither nor” and the “as well as”; the poles are potentially the same essence, only posited under two factors which are opposed
- HoP 3",180
12510,"Both poles depend “only upon whether  or - preponderates”; they are not pure abstractions
- HoP 3",97
12511,"The empirical magnet is iron
- HoP 3",36
12512,"All bodies are mere metamorphoses of iron—they are potentially contained in iron
- HoP 3",88
12513,"Every two different bodies which touch each other set up mutually in each other relative diminution and increase of cohesion
- HoP 3",132
12514,"This mutual alteration of cohesion by means of the contact of two different bodies is electricity; the cohesion-diminishing factor E is the potency of hydrogen,-E is the potency of oxygen
- HoP 3",195
12515,"The totality of the dynamic process is represented only by the chemical process”428  “By the positing of the dynamic totality the addition of light is directly posited as a product
- HoP 3",188
12517,"On the one hand, however, he did not complete this representation, and on the other hand, he has confined himself mainly to implicit existence, and has mixed therewith the formalism of external construction according to a presupposed scheme
- HoP 3",248
12518,"In this representation he advanced only as far as the organism, and did not reach the presentation of the other side of knowledge, ie the philosophy of spirit
- HoP 3",166
12519,"Schelling began time after time, in accordance with the idea implied in this construction, to work out the natural universe, and especially the organism
- HoP 3",160
12521,"Following up Kant’s meagre attempt at demonstrating spirit in nature, he devoted special attention to inaugurating anew this mode of regarding nature, so as to recognize in objective existence the same schematism, the same rhythm, as is present in the ideal
- HoP 3",265
12522,"Hence nature represents itself therein not as something alien to spirit, but as being in its general aspect a projection of spirit into an objective mode
- HoP 3",161
12523,"Natural Philosophy is no new science; we met with it continually—in the works of Aristotle, for instance, and elsewhere
- HoP 3",127
12524,"English Philosophy is also a mere apprehension in thought of the physical; forces, laws of Nature, are its fundamental determinations
- HoP 3",141
12526,"The only difference is that in physics thoughts are formal thoughts of the understanding, whose material and content cannot, as regards their details, be determined by thought itself, but must be taken from experience
- HoP 3",225
12527,"But concrete thought contains its determination and its content in itself, and merely the external mode of appearance pertains to the senses
- HoP 3",148
12528,"If, then, Philosophy passes beyond the form of the understanding, and has apprehended the speculative Notion, it must alter the determinations of thought, the categories of the understanding regarding Nature
- HoP 3",215
12529,"Kant was the first to set about this; and Schelling has sought to grasp the Notion of Nature, instead of contenting himself with the ordinary metaphysics of the same
- HoP 3",173
12530,"Nature is to him nothing but the external mode of existence as regards the system of thought-forms, just as mind is the existence of the same system in the form of consciousness
- HoP 3",185
12532,"He has not only shown these forms in Nature, but has also sought to evolve Nature out of a principle of this kind
- HoP 3",121
12535,"All such oppositions may be employed; but they are only abstract, and refer to different stages in the development of the logical principle itself
- HoP 3",154
12536,"Form and essence are distinguished by Schelling in this way, that form, regarded on its own account, is the particular, or the emerging of difference, subjectivity
- HoP 3",171
12537,"But real existence is absolute form or absolute knowledge immediately in itself, a self-conscious existence in the sense of thinking knowledge, just as with Spinoza it had the form of something objective or in thought
- HoP 3",225
12538,"Speculative Philosophy is to be found in this assertion, not that it asserts an independent philosophy, for it is purely organization; knowledge is based on the Absolute
- HoP 3",177
12539,"Thus Schelling has again given to transcendental Idealism the significance of absolute Idealism
- HoP 3",103
12540,"This unity of existence and form is thus, according to Schelling, the Absolute; or if we regard reality as the universal, and form as the particular, the Absolute is the absolute unity of universal and particular, or of Being and knowledge
- HoP 3",247
12541,"The different aspects, subject and object, or universal and particular, are only ideal oppositions; they are in the Absolute entirely and altogether one
- HoP 3",160
12542,"This unity as form is intellectual intuition, which posits Thinking and Being as absolutely alike, and as it formally expresses the Absolute, it becomes at the same time the expression of its essence
- HoP 3",207
12543,"He who has not the power of imagination, whereby he may represent this unity to himself, is deficient in the organ of Philosophy
- HoP 3",136
12545,"Construction merely consists in leading back everything determined and particular into the Absolute, or regarding it as it is in absolute unity; its determinateness is only its ideal moment, but its truth is really its Being in the Absolute
- HoP 3",248
12546,"These three moments or potencies—that of the passing of existence (the infinite) into form (the finite), and of form into existence (which are both relative unities), and the third, the absolute unity, thus recur anew in each individual
- HoP 3",244
12549,"But these two unities, as in the Absolute, are not outside of one another, but in one another, and therefore the Absolute is absolute indifference of form and existence,” as unity of this double passing-into-one
- HoP 3",219
12552,"At this point form, as the particular, strikes into existence, and itself becomes absolute
- HoP 3",98
12553,"Form which passes into existence places itself as absolute activity and positive cause of reality in opposition to the existence which passes into form, and which appears only as ground
- HoP 3",193
12555,"The ground or basis, Nature as basis merely, is matter, gravity, as the first potency; this passing of form into existence is in the actual world universal mechanism, necessity
- HoP 3",184
12556,"But the second potency is “the light which shineth in darkness, form which has passed into existence
- HoP 3",108
12560,"But art is the Absolute in sensuous form alone
- HoP 3",54
12563,"For in one of his writings, directed on some particular occasion against Jacobi, Schelling explains himself further with regard to the nature of God and His relation to Nature
- HoP 3",183
12564,"He says: “God, or more properly the existence which is God, is ground: He is ground of Himself as a moral Being
- HoP 3",119
12565,"But” then “it is ground that He makes Himself”—not cause
- HoP 3",64
12566,"Something must precede intelligence, and that something is Being—“since thought is the exact opposite of Being
- HoP 3",118
12567,"That which is the beginning of an intelligence cannot be in its turn intelligent, since there would otherwise be no distinction; but it cannot be absolutely unintelligent, for the very reason that it is the potentiality of an intelligence
- HoP 3",246
12569,"On this account Schelling’s philosophy has later been termed a Philosophy of Nature, and that in the sense of a universal philosophy, while at first Natural Philosophy was held to be only a part of the whole
- HoP 3",215
12570,"It is not incumbent on us here to give a more detailed account of Schelling’s philosophy, or to show points in the expositions hitherto given by him which are far from satisfactory
- HoP 3",188
12571,"The system is the latest form of Philosophy which we had to consider, and it is a form both interesting and true
- HoP 3",120
12572,"In the first place special emphasis, in dealing with Schelling, must be laid on the idea that he has grasped the true as the concrete, as the unity of subjective and objective
- HoP 3",183
12573,"The main point in Schelling’s philosophy thus is that its interest centres round that deep, speculative content, which, as content, is the content with which Philosophy in the entire course of its history has had to do
- HoP 3",226
12574,"The Thought which is free and independent, not abstract, but in itself concrete, comprehends itself in itself as an intellectually actual world; and this is the truth of Nature, Nature in itself
- HoP 3",202
12575,"The second great merit possessed by Schelling is to have pointed out in Nature the forms of Spirit; thus electricity, magnetism, &c, are for him only external modes of the Idea
- HoP 3",184
12576,"His defect is that this Idea in general, its distinction into the ideal and the natural world, and also the totality of these determinations, are not shown forth and developed as necessitated in themselves by the Notion
- HoP 3",227
12577,"As Schelling has not risen to this point of view, he has misconceived the nature of thought; the work of art thus becomes for him the supreme and only mode in which the Idea exists for spirit
- HoP 3",199
12578,"But the supreme mode of the Idea is really its own element; thought, the Idea apprehended, is therefore higher than the work of art
- HoP 3",139
12579,"The Idea is the truth, and all that is true is the Idea; the systematizing of the Idea into the world must be proved to be a necessary unveiling and revelation
- HoP 3",167
12580,"With Schelling, on the other hand, form is really an external scheme, and his method is the artificial application of this scheme to external objects
- HoP 3",157
12582,"These forms were potencies with Schelling, but instead of mathematical forms or a type of thought like this, by some other men sensuous forms have been taken as basis, just as were sulphur and mercury by Jacob Boehme
- HoP 3",224
12584,"Brilliant powers of imagination are displayed, such as were exhibited by Görres
- HoP 3",87
12585,"This mistake of applying forms which are taken from one sphere of Nature to another sphere of the same has been carried a long way; Oken, for example, calls wood-fibres the nerves and brain of the plant, and is almost crazy on the subject
- HoP 3",246
12586,"Philosophy would in this way become a play of mere analogical reflections; and it is not with these but with thoughts that we have to do
- HoP 3",144
12588,"That is a most false mode of proceeding; Schelling took advantage of it to some extent, others have made a complete misuse of it
- HoP 3",136
12589,"All this is done to escape thought; nevertheless, thought is the ultimate simple determination which has to be dealt with
- HoP 3",129
12591,"This whole tendency places itself, in the first place, in opposition to reflective thought, or to progress in fixed, steadfast, immovable Notions
- HoP 3",153
12594,"The philosophy of Locke is not so crude as it is, for it is not a whit better in either its content or its form, and it is combined with foolish self-conceit into the bargain
- HoP 3",182
12595,"Philosophy on this account sank into general and well-deserved contempt, such as is for the most part extended to those who assert that they have a monopoly of philosophy
- HoP 3",178
12597,"Five-and-twenty years ago436 the case was the same with poetic art; a taste for ingenious conceits took possession of it, and the effusions of its poetic inspiration came forth blindly from itself, shot out as from a pistol
- HoP 3",231
12598,"The results were either crazy ravings, or, if they were not ravings, they were prose so dull that it was unworthy of the name of prose
- HoP 3",142
12599,"It is just the same in the later philosophies
- HoP 3",53
12601,"As in the Philosophy of Nature men forgot the Notion and proceeded in a dead unspiritual course, so here they lose sight of spirit entirely
- HoP 3",147
12602,"They have strayed from the right road; for by their principle, Notion and perception are one unity, but in point of fact this unity, this spirit, itself emerges in immediacy, and is therefore in intuitive perception, and not in the Notion
- HoP 3",246
12604,"Nature, and the world or history of spirit, are the two realities; what exists as actual Nature is an image of divine Reason; the forms of self-conscious Reason are also the forms of Nature
- HoP 3",197
12605,"The ultimate aim and business of philosophy is to reconcile thought or the Notion with reality
- HoP 3",102
12606,"It is easy from subordinate standpoints to find satisfaction in modes of intuitive perception and of feeling
- HoP 3",116
12607,"But the deeper the spirit goes within itself, the more vehement is the opposition, the more abundant is the wealth without; the depth is to be measured by the greatness of the craving with which spirit seeks to find itself in what lies outside of itself
- HoP 3",261
12608,"Its first activity is formal; Aristotle was the first to say that νοῦς is the thought of thought
- HoP 3",104
12609,"The result is the thought which is at home with itself, and at the same time embraces the universe therein, and transforms it into an intelligent world
- HoP 3",159
12611,"Philosophy is thus the true theodicy, as contrasted with art and religion and the feelings which these call up—a reconciliation of spirit, namely of the spirit which has apprehended itself in its freedom and in the riches of its reality
- HoP 3",244
12612,"To this point the World-spirit has come, and each stage has its own form in the true system of Philosophy; nothing is lost, all principles are preserved, since Philosophy in its final aspect is the totality of forms
- HoP 3",223
12613,"This concrete idea is the result of the strivings of spirit during almost twenty-five centuries of earnest work to become objective to itself, to know itself:    Tantæ molis erat, se ipsam cognoscere mentem
- HoP 3",214
12614,"What we pass in rapid review when we recall it, stretched itself out in reality to this great length of time
- HoP 3",116
12615,"For in this lengthened period, the Notion of Spirit, invested with its entire concrete development, its external subsistence, its wealth, is striving to bring spirit to perfection, to make progress itself and to develop from spirit
- HoP 3",239
12616,"It goes ever on and on, because spirit is progress alone
- HoP 3",64
12617,"At such a time, when the encircling crust, like a soulless decaying tenement, crumbles away, and spirit displays itself arrayed in new youth, the seven league boots are at length adopted
- HoP 3",194
12618,"This work of the spirit to know itself, this activity to find itself, is the life of the spirit and the spirit itself
- HoP 3",125
12619,"Its result is the Notion which it takes up of itself; the history of Philosophy is a revelation of what has been the aim of spirit throughout its history; it is therefore the world’s history in its innermost signification
- HoP 3",229
12620,"This work of the human spirit in the recesses of thought is parallel with all the stages of reality; and therefore no philosophy oversteps its own time
- HoP 3",159
12621,"The importance which the determinations of thought possessed is another matter, which does not belong to the history of Philosophy
- HoP 3",138
12622,"These Notions are the simplest revelation of the World spirit: in their more concrete form they are history
- HoP 3",115
12623,"We must, therefore, in the first place not esteem lightly what spirit has won, namely its gains up to the present day
- HoP 3",125
12624,"Ancient Philosophy is to be reverenced as necessary, and as a link in this sacred chain, but all the same nothing more than a link
- HoP 3",138
12625,"The present is the highest stage reached
- HoP 3",48
12627,"In the third place we do not find here feeble little efforts to establish or to criticize this or that particular point; instead of that, each philosophy sets up a new principle of its own, and this must be recognized
- HoP 3",225
12629,"The philosophy of the ancients had the absolute Idea as its thought; and the realization or reality of the same consisted in comprehending the existing present world, and regarding it as it is in its absolute nature
- HoP 3",223
12630,"This philosophy did not make its starting-point the Idea itself, but proceeded from the objective as from something given, and transformed the same into the Idea; the Being of Parmenides
- HoP 3",194
12631,"Abstract thought, νοῦς, became known to itself as universal essence or existence, not as subjective thought; the Universal of Plato
- HoP 3",139
12632,"In Aristotle the Notion emerges, free and unconstrained, as comprehending thought, permeating and spiritualizing all the forms which the universe contains
- HoP 3",162
12633,"The Notion as subject, its independence, its inwardness, abstract separation, is represented by the Stoics, Epicureans and Sceptics: here we have not the free, concrete form, but universality abstract and in itself formal
- HoP 3",229
12634,"The thought of totality, the intelligible world, is the concrete Idea as we have seen it with the Neo-Platonists
- HoP 3",120
12636,"But it has been the work of modern times to grasp this Idea as spirit, as the Idea that knows itself
- HoP 3",108
12637,"In order to proceed from the conscious Idea to the self-conscious, we must have the infinite opposition, namely the fact that the Idea has come to the consciousness of being absolutely sundered in twain
- HoP 3",210
12638,"As spirit had the thought of objective existence, Philosophy thus perfected the intellectuality of the world, and produced this spiritual world as an object existing beyond present reality, like Nature,—the first creation of spirit
- HoP 3",239
12639,"The work of the spirit now consisted in bringing this Beyond back to reality, and guiding it into self-consciousness
- HoP 3",124
12640,"This is accomplished by self-consciousness thinking itself, and recognizing absolute existence to be the self-consciousness that thinks itself
- HoP 3",150
12641,"Self-consciousness, in the first place, thinks of itself as consciousness; therein is contained all objective reality, and the positive, intuitive reference of its reality to the other side
- HoP 3",197
12642,"In the second place, self-consciousness thinks of itself as being self-consciousness; in being self-conscious it is independent, but still in this independence it has a negative relation to what is outside self-consciousness
- HoP 3",232
12643,"This is infinite subjectivity, which appears at one time as the critique of thought in the case of Kant, and at another time, in the case of Fichte, as the tendency or impulse towards the concrete
- HoP 3",204
12644,"Absolute, pure, infinite form is expressed as self-consciousness, the Ego
- HoP 3",81
12645,"This is a light that breaks forth on spiritual substance, and shows absolute content and absolute form to be identical;—substance is in itself identical with knowledge
- HoP 3",175
12647,"This is intellectual perception; but it is requisite in order that it should be in truth intellectual, that it should not be that merely immediate perception of the eternal and the divine which we hear of, but should be absolute knowledge
- HoP 3",246
12649,"But intellectual intuition is knowledge, since, in the first place, in spite of the separation of each of the opposed sides from the other, all external reality is known as internal
- HoP 3",189
12650,"If it is known according to its essence, as it is, it shows itself as not existing of itself, but as essentially consisting in the movement of transition
- HoP 3",161
12654,"This Absolute is not at rest, and that opposition is not the unresting Notion; for the Idea, unresting though it is, is yet at rest and satisfied in itself
- HoP 3",163
12656,"To know opposition in unity, and unity in opposition—this is absolute knowledge; and science is the knowledge of this unity in its whole development by means of itself
- HoP 3",175
12657,"This is then the demand of all time and of Philosophy
- HoP 3",61
12658,"A new epoch has arisen in the world
- HoP 3",43
12659,"The strife of the finite self-consciousness with the absolute self-consciousness, which last seemed to the other to lie outside of itself, now comes to an end
- HoP 3",166
12660,"Finite self-consciousness has ceased to be finite; and in this way absolute self-consciousness has, on the other hand, attained to the reality which it lacked before
- HoP 3",173
12661,"This is the whole history of the world in general up to the present time, and the history of Philosophy in particular, the sole work of which is to depict this strife
- HoP 3",174
12662,"Now, indeed, it seems to have reached its goal, when this absolute self-consciousness, which it had the work of representing, has ceased to be alien, and when spirit accordingly is realized as spirit
- HoP 3",207
12663,"For it becomes such only as the result of its knowing itself to be absolute spirit, and this it knows in real scientific knowledge
- HoP 3",138
12665,"In scientific knowledge alone it knows itself as absolute spirit; and this knowledge, or spirit, is its only true existence
- HoP 3",131
12666,"This then is the standpoint of the present day, and the series of spiritual forms is with it for the present concluded
- HoP 3",126
12667,"At this point I bring this history of Philosophy to a close
- HoP 3",67
12668,"It has been my desire that you should learn from it that the history of Philosophy is not a blind collection of fanciful ideas, nor a fortuitous progression
- HoP 3",164
12669,"I have rather sought to show the necessary development of the successive philosophies from one another, so that the one of necessity presupposes another preceding it
- HoP 3",173
12671,"The latest philosophy contains therefore those which went before; it embraces in itself all the different stages thereof; it is the product and result of those that preceded it
- HoP 3",184
12672,"We can now, for example, be Platonists no longer
- HoP 3",56
12673,"Moreover we must raise ourselves once for all above the pettinesses of individual opinions, thoughts, objections, and difficulties; and also above our own vanity, as if our individual thoughts were of any particular value
- HoP 3",229
12674,"For to apprehend the inward substantial spirit is the standpoint of the individual; as parts of the whole, individuals are like blind men, who are driven forward by the indwelling spirit of the whole
- HoP 3",207
12675,"Our standpoint now is accordingly the knowledge of this Idea as spirit, as absolute Spirit, which in this way opposes to itself another spirit, the finite, the principle of which is to know absolute spirit, in order that absolute spirit may become existent for it
- HoP 3",271
12676,"I have tried to develop and bring before your thoughts this series of successive spiritual forms pertaining to Philosophy in its progress, and to indicate the connection between them
- HoP 3",190
12678,"This long procession of spirits is formed by the individual pulses which beat in its life; they are the organism of our substance, an absolutely necessary progression, which expresses nothing less than the nature of spirit itself, and which lives in us all
- HoP 3",264
12680,"I have to express my thanks to you for the attention with which you have listened to me while I have been making this attempt; it is in great measure due to you that my efforts have met with so great a measure of success
- HoP 3",228
12681,"And it has been a source of pleasure to myself to have been associated with you in this spiritual community; I ought not to speak of it as if it were a thing of the past, for I hope that a spiritual bond has been knit between us which will prove permanent
- HoP 3",263
12682,"I bid you a most hearty farewell
- HoP 3",40
12683,"PHILOSOPHY misses an advantage enjoyed by the other sciences
- EnL",66
12684,"It cannot like them rest the existence of its objects on the natural admissions of consciousness, nor can it assume that its method of cognition, either for starting or for continuing, is one already accepted
- EnL",214
12685,"The objects of philosophy, it is true, are upon the whole the same as those of religion
- EnL",93
12686,"In both the object is Truth, in that supreme sense in which God and God only is the Truth
- EnL",95
12687,"Both in like manner go on to treat of the finite worlds of Nature and the human Mind, with their relation to each other and to their truth in God
- EnL",151
12689,"But with the rise of this thinking study of things, it soon becomes evident that thought will be satisfied with nothing short of showing the necessity of its facts, of demonstrating the existence of its objects, as well as their nature and qualities
- EnL",255
12690,"Our original acquaintance with them is thus discovered to be inadequate
- EnL",77
12691,"We can assume nothing, and assert nothing dogmatically; nor can we accept the assertions and assumptions of others
- EnL",120
12692,"And yet we must make a beginning: and a beginning, as primary and underived, makes an assumption, or rather is an assumption
- EnL",130
12693,"It seems as if it were impossible to make a beginning at all
- EnL",66
12694,"This thinking study of things may serve, in a general way, as a description of philosophy
- EnL",95
12695,"But the description is too wide
- EnL",37
12696,"If it be correct to say, that thought makes the distinction between man and the lower animals, then everything human is human, for the sole and simple reason that it is due to the operation of thought
- EnL",206
12697,"Philosophy, on the other hand, is a peculiar mode of thinking--a mode in which thinking becomes knowledge, and knowledge through notions
- EnL",142
12698,"However great therefore may be the identity and essential unity of the two modes of thought, the philosophic mode gets to be different from the more general thought which acts in all that is human, in all that gives humanity its distinctive character
- EnL",256
12700,"According to an old preconceived idea, which has passed into a trivial proposition, it is thought which marks the man off from the animals
- EnL",144
12701,"Yet trivial as this old belief may seem, it must, strangely enough, be recalled to mind in presence of certain preconceived ideas of the present day
- EnL",154
12702,"These ideas would put feeling and thought so far apart as to make them opposites, and would represent them as so antagonistic, that feeling, particularly religious feeling, is supposed to be contaminated, perverted, and even annihilated by thought
- EnL",253
12703,"They also emphatically hold that religion and piety grow out of, and rest upon something else, and not on thought
- EnL",119
12704,"But those who make this separation forget meanwhile that only man has the capacity for religion, and that animals no more have religion than they have law and morality
- EnL",173
12705,"Those who insist on this separation of religion from thinking usually have before their minds the sort of thought that may be styled after-thought
- EnL",152
12706,"They mean 'reflective' thinking, which has to deal with thoughts as thoughts, and brings them into consciousness
- EnL",118
12707,"Slackness to perceive and keep in view this distinction which philosophy definitely draws in respect of thinking is the source of the crudest objections and reproaches against philosophy
- EnL",192
12708,"Man,--and that just because it is his nature to think,--is the only being that possesses law, religion, and morality
- EnL",122
12709,"In these spheres of human life, therefore, thinking, under the guise of feeling, faith, or generalised image, has not been inactive: its action and its productions are there present and therein contained
- EnL",209
12710,"But it is one thing to have such feelings and generalised images that have been moulded and permeated by thought, and another thing to have thoughts about them
- EnL",165
12711,"The thoughts, to which after-thought upon those modes of consciousness gives rise, are what is comprised under reflection, general reasoning, and the like, as well as under philosophy itself
- EnL",196
12712,"The neglect of this distinction between thought in general and the reflective thought of philosophy has also led to another and more frequent misunderstanding
- EnL",164
12713,"Reflection of this kind has been often maintained to be the condition, or even the only way, of attaining a consciousness and certitude of the Eternal and True
- EnL",165
12714,"The (now somewhat antiquated) metaphysical proofs of God's existence, for example, have been treated, as if a knowledge of them and a conviction of their truth were the only and essential means of producing a belief and conviction that there is a God
- EnL",256
12715,"Such a doctrine would find its parallel, if we said that eating was impossible before we had acquired a knowledge of the chemical, botanical, and zoological characters of our food; and that we must delay digestion till we had finished the study of anatomy and physiology
- EnL",276
12716,"Or rather, instead of being indispensable, they would not exist at all
- EnL",76
12717,"The Content, of whatever kind it be, with which our consciousness is taken up, is what constitutes the qualitative character of our feelings, perceptions, fancies, and ideas; of our aims and duties; and of our thoughts and notions
- EnL",236
12718,"From this point of view, feeling, perception, &c are the forms assumed by these contents
- EnL",94
12719,"The contents remain one and the same, whether they are felt, seen, represented, or willed, and whether they are merely felt, or felt with an admixture of thoughts, or merely and simply thought
- EnL",198
12720,"In any one of these forms, or in the admixture of several, the contents confront consciousness, or are its object
- EnL",119
12721,"But when they are thus objects of consciousness, the modes of the several forms ally themselves with the contents; and each form of them appears in consequence to give rise to a special object
- EnL",198
12722,"Thus what is the same at bottom, may look like a different sort of fact
- EnL",77
12724,"Mental impressions such as these may be regarded as the metaphors of thoughts and notions
- EnL",95
12725,"But to have these figurate conceptions does not imply that we appreciate their intellectual significance, the thoughts and rational notions to which they correspond
- EnL",170
12726,"Conversely, it is one thing to have thoughts and intelligent notions, and another to know what impressions, perceptions, and feelings correspond to them
- EnL",158
12727,"This difference will to some extent explain what people call the unintelligibility of philosophy
- EnL",102
12728,"Their difficulty lies partly in an incapacity--which in itself is nothing but want of habit--for abstract thinking; ie in an inability to get hold of pure thoughts and move about in them
- EnL",192
12729,"In our ordinary state of mind, the thoughts are clothed upon and made one with the sensuous or spiritual material of the hour; and in reflection, meditation, and general reasoning, we introduce a blend of thoughts into feelings, percepts, and mental images
- EnL",262
12730,"But it is a very different thing to make the thoughts pure and simple our object
- EnL",86
12731,"But their complaint that philosophy is unintelligible is as much due to another reason; and that is an impatient wish to have before them as a mental picture that which is in the mind as a thought or notion
- EnL",212
12732,"But the fact is that in a notion there is nothing further to be thought than the notion itself
- EnL",100
12733,"The mind, denied the use of its familiar ideas, feels the ground where it once stood firm and at home taken away from beneath it, and, when transported into the region of pure thought, cannot tell where in the world it is
- EnL",227
12734,"One consequence of this weakness is that authors, preachers, and orators are found most intelligible, when they speak of things which their readers or hearers already know by rote,--things which the latter are conversant with, and which require no explanation
- EnL",265
12735,"The philosopher then has to reckon with popular modes of thought, and with the objects of religion
- EnL",104
12736,"In dealing with the ordinary modes of mind, he will first of all, as we saw, have to prove and almost to awaken the need for his peculiar method of knowledge
- EnL",163
12739,"And that is the conviction that to get at the truth of any object or event, even of feelings, perceptions, opinions, and mental ideas, we must think it over
- EnL",162
12740,"Now in any case to think things over is at least to transform feelings, ordinary ideas, &c into thoughts
- EnL",110
12741,"Nature has given every one a faculty of thought
- EnL",53
12742,"But thought is all that philosophy claims as the form proper to her business: and thus the inadequate view which ignores the distinction stated in § 3, leads to a new delusion, the reverse of the complaint previously mentioned about the unintelligibility of philosophy
- EnL",274
12743,"In other words, this science must often submit to the slight of hearing even people who have never taken any trouble with it talking as if they thoroughly understood all about it
- EnL",184
12744,"With no preparation beyond an ordinary education they do not hesitate, especially under the influence of religious sentiment, to philosophise and to criticise philosophy
- EnL",175
12745,"Everybody allows that to know any other science you must have first studied it, and that you can only claim to express a judgment upon it in virtue of such knowledge
- EnL",171
12746,"Everybody allows that to make a shoe you must have learned and practised the craft of the shoemaker, though every man has a model in his own foot, and possesses in his hands the natural endowments for the operations required
- EnL",230
12747,"For philosophy alone, it seems to be imagined, such study, care, and application are not in the least requisite
- EnL",117
12748,"This comfortable view of what is required for a philosopher has recently received corroboration through the theory of immediate or intuitive knowledge
- EnL",156
12749,"So much for the form of philosophical knowledge
- EnL",53
12751,"At first we become aware of these contents in what we call Experience
- EnL",75
12752,"But even Experience, as it surveys the wide range of inward and outward existence, has sense enough to distinguish the mere appearance, which is transient and meaningless, from what in itself really deserves the name of actuality
- EnL",235
12753,"As it is only in form that philosophy is distinguished from other modes of attaining an acquaintance with this same sum of being, it must necessarily be in harmony with actuality and experience
- EnL",199
12754,"In fact, this harmony may be viewed as at least an extrinsic means of testing the truth of a philosophy
- EnL",109
12755,"Similarly it may be held the highest and final aim of philosophic science to bring about, through the ascertainment of this harmony, a reconciliation of the self-conscious reason with the reason which is in the world,--in other words, with actuality
- EnL",255
12756,"In the preface to my Philosophy of Law, p xix, are found the propositions:           What is reasonable is actual;     and, What is actual is reasonable
- EnL",158
12757,"These simple statements have given rise to expressions of surprise and hostility, even in quarters where it would be reckoned an insult to presume absence of philosophy, and still more of religion
- EnL",202
12758,"Religion at least need not be brought in evidence; its doctrines of the divine government of the world affirm these propositions too decidedly
- EnL",148
12760,"In common life, any freak of fancy, any error, evil and everything of the nature of evil, as well as every degenerate and transitory existence whatever, gets in a casual way the name of actuality
- EnL",201
12761,"But even our ordinary feelings are enough to forbid a casual (fortuitous) existence getting the emphatic name of an actual; for by fortuitous we mean an existence which has no greater value than that of something possible, which may as well not be as be
- EnL",259
12762,"As for the term Actuality, these critics would have done well to consider the sense in which I employ it
- EnL",110
12763,"In a detailed Logic I had treated amongst other things of actuality, and accurately distinguished it not only from the fortuitous, which, after all, has existence, but even from the cognate categories of existence and the other modifications of being
- EnL",256
12764,"The actuality of the rational stands opposed by the popular fancy that Ideas and ideals are nothing but chimeras, and philosophy a mere system of such phantasms
- EnL",166
12765,"It is also opposed by the very different fancy that Ideas and ideals are something far too excellent to have actuality, or something too impotent to procure it for themselves
- EnL",180
12767,"As if the world had waited on it to learn how it ought to be, and was not!
- EnL",80
12768,"For, if it were as it ought to be, what would come of the precocious wisdom of that 'ought'?
- EnL",98
12769,"In such a case the intelligent observer may meet much that fails to satisfy the general requirements of right; for who is not acute enough to see a great deal in his own surroundings which is really far from being as it ought to be?
- EnL",238
12770,"But such acuteness is mistaken in the conceit that, when it examines these objects and pronounces what they ought to be, it is dealing with questions of philosophic science
- EnL",178
12771,"The object of philosophy is the Idea: and the Idea is not so impotent as merely to have a right or an obligation to exist without actually existing
- EnL",153
12772,"The object of philosophy is an actuality of which those objects, social regulations and conditions, are only the superficial outside
- EnL",138
12773,"Thus reflection--thinking things over--in a general way involves the principle (which also means the beginning) of philosophy
- EnL",131
12776,"It thus appears that modern philosophy derives its materials from our own personal observations and perceptions of the external and internal world, from nature as well as from the mind and heart of man, when both stand in the immediate presence of the observer
- EnL",266
12777,"This principle of Experience carries with it the unspeakably important condition that, in order to accept and believe any fact, we must be in contact with it; or, in more exact terms, that we must find the fact united and combined with the certainty of our own selves
- EnL",273
12778,"Those sciences, which thus got the name of philosophy, we call empirical sciences, for the reason that they take their departure from experience
- EnL",150
12779,"Still the essential results which they aim at and provide, are laws, general propositions, a theory--the thoughts of what is found existing
- EnL",145
12780,"On this ground the Newtonian physics was called Natural Philosophy
- EnL",72
12782,"In England this is still the usual signification of the term philosophy
- EnL",77
12783,"Newton continues to be celebrated as the greatest of philosophers: and the name goes down as far as the price-lists of instrument-makers
- EnL",142
12784,"All instruments, such as the thermometer and barometer, which do not come under the special head of magnetic or electric apparatus, are styled philosophical instruments1
- EnL",175
12785,"Surely thought, and not a mere combination of wood, iron, &c ought to be called the instrument of philosophy!
- EnL",115
12786,"The recent science of Political Economy in particular, which in Germany is known as Rational Economy of the State, or intelligent national economy, has in England especially appropriated the name of philosophy2  8
- EnL",219
12787,"In its own field this empirical knowledge may at first give satisfaction; but in two ways it is seen to come short
- EnL",120
12788,"In the first place there is another circle of objects which it does not embrace
- EnL",85
12789,"These are Freedom, Spirit, and God
- EnL",40
12790,"They belong to a different sphere, not because it can be said that they have nothing to do with experience; for though they are certainly not experiences of the senses, it is quite an identical proposition to say that whatever is in consciousness is experienced
- EnL",267
12791,"The real ground for assigning them to another field of cognition is that in their scope and content these objects evidently show themselves as infinite
- EnL",157
12792,"There is an old phrase often wrongly attributed to Aristotle, and supposed to express the general tenor of his philosophy
- EnL",127
12793,"If speculative philosophy refused to admit this maxim, it can only have done so from a misunderstanding
- EnL",109
12794,"It will, however, on the converse side no less assert: 'Nihil est in sensu quod non fuerit in intellectu'
- EnL",111
12795,"And this may be taken in two senses
- EnL",41
12796,"In the general sense it means that νοῦς or spirit (the more profound idea of νοῦς in modern thought) is the cause of the world
- EnL",132
12797,"In its special meaning (see § 2) it asserts that the sentiment of right, morals, and religion is a sentiment (and in that way an experience) of such scope and such character that it can spring from and rest upon thought alone
- EnL",231
12798,"But in the second place in point of form the subjective reason desires a further satisfaction than empirical knowledge gives; and this form, is, in the widest sense of the term, Necessity (§ 1)
- EnL",199
12799,"The method of empirical science exhibits two defects
- EnL",58
12800,"The first is that the Universal or general principle contained in it, the genus, or kind, &c, is, on its own account, indeterminate and vague, and therefore not on its own account connected with the Particulars or the details
- EnL",231
12801,"Either is external and accidental to the other; and it is the same with the particular facts which are brought into union: each is external and accidental to the others
- EnL",174
12802,"The second defect is that the beginnings are in every case data and postulates, neither accounted for nor deduced
- EnL",119
12803,"In both these points the form of necessity fails to get its due
- EnL",69
12804,"Hence reflection, whenever it sets itself to remedy these defects, becomes speculative thinking, the thinking proper to philosophy
- EnL",136
12806,"The relation of speculative science to the other sciences may be stated in the following terms
- EnL",100
12808,"The difference, looked at in this way, is only a change of categories
- EnL",75
12809,"Speculative Logic contains all previous Logic and Metaphysics: it preserves the same forms of thought, the same laws and objects,--while at the same time remodelling and expanding them with wider categories
- EnL",212
12810,"From notion in the speculative sense we should distinguish what is ordinarily called a notion
- EnL",99
12811,"The phrase, that no notion can ever comprehend the Infinite, a phrase which has been repeated over and over again till it has grown axiomatic, is based upon this narrow estimate of what is meant by notions
- EnL",211
12812,"This thought, which is proposed as the instrument of philosophic knowledge, itself calls for further explanation
- EnL",118
12813,"Such an explanation, however, is itself a lesson in philosophy, and properly falls within the scope of the science itself
- EnL",127
12814,"A preliminary attempt to make matters plain would only be unphilosophical, and consist of a tissue of assumptions, assertions, and inferential pros and cons, eg of dogmatism without cogency, as against which there would be an equal right of counter-dogmatism
- EnL",264
12815,"A main line of argument in the Critical Philosophy bids us pause before proceeding to inquire into God or into the true being of things, and tells us first of all to examine the faculty of cognition and see whether it is equal to such an effort
- EnL",250
12816,"The plausibility of this suggestion has won for it general assent and admiration; the result of which has been to withdraw cognition from an interest in its objects and absorption in the study of them, and to direct it back upon itself; and so turn it to a question of form
- EnL",279
12817,"Unless we wish to be deceived bywords, it is easy to see what this amounts to
- EnL",83
12818,"In the case of other instruments, we can try and criticise them in other ways than by setting about the special work for which they are destined
- EnL",150
12819,"But the examination of knowledge can only be carried out by an act of knowledge
- EnL",85
12820,"To examine this so-called instrument is the same thing as to know it
- EnL",74
12821,"But to seek to know before we know is as absurd as the wise resolution of Scholasticus, not to venture into the water until he had learned to swim
- EnL",152
12822,"Reinhold saw the confusion with which this style of commencement is chargeable, and tried to get out of the difficulty by starting with a hypothetical and problematical stage of philosophising
- EnL",198
12823,"In this way he supposed that it would be possible, nobody can tell how, to get along, until we found ourselves, further on, arrived at the primary truth of truths
- EnL",168
12824,"His method, when closely looked into, will be seen to be identical with a very common practice
- EnL",100
12825,"It starts from a substratum of experiential fact, or from a provisional assumption which has been brought into a definition; and then proceeds to analyse this starting-point
- EnL",179
12826,"We can detect in Reinhold's argument a perception of the truth, that the usual course which proceeds by assumptions and anticipations is no better than a hypothetical and problematical mode of procedure
- EnL",208
12827,"But his perceiving this does not alter the character of this method; it only makes clear its imperfections
- EnL",112
12828,"The special conditions which call for the existence of philosophy maybe thus described
- EnL",92
12829,"The mind or spirit, when it is sentient or perceptive, finds its object in something sensuous; when it imagines, in a picture or image; when it wills, in an aim or end
- EnL",173
12830,"But in contrast to, or it may be only in distinction from, these forms of its existence and of its objects, the mind has also to gratify the cravings of its highest and most inward life
- EnL",191
12831,"That innermost self is thought
- EnL",36
12832,"Thus the mind renders thought its object
- EnL",46
12833,"In the best meaning of the phrase, it comes to itself; for thought is its principle, and its very unadulterated self
- EnL",122
12834,"But while thus occupied, thought entangles itself in contradictions, eg loses itself in the hard-and-fast non-identity of its thoughts, and so, instead of reaching itself, is caught and held in its counterpart
- EnL",215
12835,"This result, to which honest but narrow thinking leads the mere understanding, is resisted by the loftier craving of which we have spoken
- EnL",143
12836,"That craving expresses the perseverance of thought, which continues true to itself, even in this conscious loss of its native rest and independence, 'that it may overcome' and work out in itself the solution of its own contradictions
- EnL",239
12837,"To see that thought in its very nature is dialectical, and that, as understanding, it must fall into contradiction,--the negative of itself, will form one of the main lessons of logic
- EnL",189
12839,"The rise of philosophy is due to these cravings of thought
- EnL",64
12840,"Its point of departure is Experience; including under that name both our immediate consciousness and the inductions from it
- EnL",129
12842,"Through this state of antagonism to the phenomena of sense its first satisfaction is found in itself, in the Idea of the universal essence of these phenomena: an Idea (the Absolute, or God) which may be more or less abstract
- EnL",230
12843,"Meanwhile, on the other hand, the sciences, based on experience, exert upon the mind a stimulus to overcome the form in which their varied contents are presented, and to elevate these contents to the rank of necessary truth
- EnL",229
12844,"For the facts of science have the aspect of a vast conglomerate, one thing coming side by side with another, as if they were merely given and presented,--as in short devoid of all essential or necessary connexion
- EnL",218
12845,"In consequence of this stimulus thought is dragged out of its unrealised universality and its fancied or merely possible satisfaction, and impelled onwards to a development from itself
- EnL",190
12846,"On one hand this development only means that thought incorporates the contents of science, in all their speciality of detail as submitted
- EnL",143
12847,"On the other it makes these contents imitate the action of the original creative thought, and present the aspect of a free evolution determined by the logic of the fact alone
- EnL",180
12848,"On the relation between 'immediacy' and 'mediation' in consciousness we shall speak later, expressly and with more detail
- EnL",127
12849,"Here it may be sufficient to premise that, though the two 'moments' or factors present themselves as distinct, still neither of them can be absent, nor can one exist apart from the other
- EnL",192
12850,"Thus the knowledge of God, as of every supersensible reality, is in its true character an exaltation above sensations or perceptions: it consequently involves a negative attitude to the initial data of sense, and to that extent implies mediation
- EnL",251
12851,"For to mediate is to take something as a beginning and to go onward to a second thing; so that the existence of this second thing depends on our having reached it from something else contradistinguished from it
- EnL",216
12853,"With as much truth however we may be said to owe eating to the means of nourishment, so long as we can have no eating without them
- EnL",136
12854,"If we take this view, eating is certainly represented as ungrateful: it devours that to which it owes itself
- EnL",114
12855,"Thinking, upon this view of its action, is equally ungrateful
- EnL",67
12857,"It is thus also with religion, which, whether it be rude or elaborate, whether it be invested with scientific precision of detail or confined to the simple faith of the heart, possesses, throughout, the same intensive nature of contentment and felicity
- EnL",258
12858,"But if thought never gets further than the universality of the Ideas, as was perforce the case in the first philosophies (when the Eleatics never got beyond Being, or Heraclitus beyond Becoming), it is justly open to the charge of formalism
- EnL",246
12860,"Bearing in mind this first period of thought, the period of mere generality, we may safely say that experience is the real author of growth and advance in philosophy
- EnL",171
12861,"For, firstly, the empirical sciences do not stop short at the mere observation of the individual features of a phenomenon
- EnL",127
12862,"By the aid of thought, they are able to meet philosophy with materials prepared for it, in the shape of general uniformities, ie laws, and classifications of the phenomena
- EnL",177
12863,"When this is done, the particular facts which they contain are ready to be received into philosophy
- EnL",105
12864,"This, secondly, implies a certain compulsion on thought itself to proceed to these concrete specific truths
- EnL",113
12865,"The reception into philosophy of these scientific materials, now that thought has removed their immediacy and made them cease to be mere data, forms at the same time a development of thought out of itself
- EnL",210
12866,"Philosophy, then, owes its development to the empirical sciences
- EnL",70
12867,"In return it gives their contents what is so vital to them, the freedom of thought,--gives them, in short, an a priori character
- EnL",134
12868,"These contents are now warranted necessary, and no longer depend on the evidence of facts merely, that they were so found and so experienced
- EnL",146
12869,"The fact as experienced thus becomes an illustration and a copy of the original and completely self-supporting activity of thought
- EnL",136
12870,"Stated in exact terms, such is the origin and development of philosophy
- EnL",77
12871,"But the History of Philosophy gives us the same process from an historical and external point of view
- EnL",107
12872,"The stages in the evolution of the Idea there seem to follow each other by accident, and to present merely a number of different and unconnected principles, which the several systems of philosophy carry out in their own way
- EnL",229
12873,"But it is not so
- EnL",22
12875,"The different systems which the history of philosophy presents are therefore not irreconcilable with unity
- EnL",112
12876,"In philosophy the latest birth of time is the result of all the systems that have preceded it, and must include their principles; and so, if, on other grounds, it deserve the title of philosophy, will be the fullest, most comprehensive, and most adequate system of all
- EnL",274
12877,"The spectacle of so many and so various systems of philosophy suggests the necessity of defining more exactly the relation of Universal to Particular
- EnL",155
12878,"Even common sense in every-day matters is above the absurdity of setting a universal beside the particulars
- EnL",113
12879,"Would any one, who wished for fruit, reject cherries, pears, and grapes, on the ground that they were cherries, pears, or grapes, and not fruit?
- EnL",150
12880,"But when philosophy is in question, the excuse of many is that philosophies are so different, and none of them is the philosophy,--that each is only a philosophy
- EnL",167
12881,"Such a plea is assumed to justify any amount of contempt for philosophy
- EnL",77
12882,"And yet cherries too are fruit
- EnL",36
12883,"Often, too, a system, of which the principle is the universal, is put on a level with another of which the principle is a particular, and with theories which deny the existence of philosophy altogether
- EnL",207
12884,"Such systems are said to be only different views of philosophy
- EnL",68
12885,"The same evolution of thought which is exhibited in the history of philosophy is presented in the System of Philosophy itself
- EnL",131
12886,"Here, instead of surveying the process, as we do in history, from the outside, we see the movement of thought clearly defined in its native medium
- EnL",152
12887,"The thought, which is genuine and self-supporting, must be intrinsically concrete; it must be an Idea; and when it is viewed in the whole of its universality, it is the Idea, or the Absolute
- EnL",196
12888,"The science of this Idea must form a system
- EnL",49
12889,"For the truth is concrete; that is, whilst it gives a bond and principle of unity, it also possesses an internal source of development
- EnL",140
12890,"Truth, then, is only possible as a universe or totality of thought; and the freedom of the whole, as well as the necessity of the several sub-divisions, which it implies, are only possible when these are discriminated and defined
- EnL",235
12891,"Unless it is a system, a philosophy is not a scientific production
- EnL",72
12892,"Unsystematic philosophising can only be expected to give expression to personal peculiarities of mind, and has no principle for the regulation of its contents
- EnL",164
12893,"Apart from their interdependence and organic union, the truths of philosophy are valueless, and must then be treated as baseless hypotheses, or personal convictions
- EnL",170
12894,"Yet many philosophical treatises confine themselves to such an exposition of the opinions and sentiments of the author
- EnL",124
12895,"The term system is often misunderstood
- EnL",44
12896,"It does not denote a philosophy, the principle of which is narrow and to be distinguished from others
- EnL",107
12897,"On the contrary, a genuine philosophy makes it a principle to include every particular principle
- EnL",102
12898,"Each of the parts of philosophy is a philosophical whole, a circle rounded and complete in itself
- EnL",103
12899,"In each of these parts, however, the philosophical Idea is found in a particular specificality or medium
- EnL",110
12900,"The single circle, because it is a real totality, bursts through the limits imposed by its special medium, and gives rise to a wider circle
- EnL",145
12901,"The whole of philosophy in this way resembles a circle of circles
- EnL",71
12902,"The Idea appears in each single circle, but, at the same time, the whole Idea is constituted by the system of these peculiar phases, and each is a necessary member of the organisation
- EnL",189
12903,"In the form of an Encyclopaedia, the science has no room for a detailed exposition of particulars, and must be limited to setting forth the commencement of the special sciences and the notions of cardinal importance in them
- EnL",229
12904,"How much of the particular parts is requisite to constitute a particular branch of knowledge is so far indeterminate, that the part, if it is to be something true, must be not an isolated member merely, but itself an organic whole
- EnL",236
12905,"The entire field of philosophy therefore really forms a single science; but it may also be viewed as a total, composed of several particular sciences
- EnL",155
12906,"The encyclopaedia of philosophy must not be confounded with ordinary encyclopaedias
- EnL",89
12907,"An ordinary encyclopaedia does not pretend to be more than an aggregation of sciences, regulated by no principle, and merely as experience offers them
- EnL",156
12908,"Sometimes it even includes what merely bear the name of sciences, while they are nothing more than a collection of bits of information
- EnL",140
12909,"In an aggregate like this, the several branches of knowledge owe their place in the encyclopaedia to extrinsic reasons, and their unity is therefore artificial: they are arranged, but we cannot say they form a system
- EnL",222
12910,"For the same reason, especially as the materials to be combined also depend upon no one rule or principle, the arrangement is at best an experiment, and will always exhibit inequalities
- EnL",191
12911,"An encyclopaedia of philosophy excludes three kinds of partial science
- EnL",76
12912,"It excludes mere aggregates of bits of information
- EnL",56
12913,"Philology in its prima facie aspect belongs to this class
- EnL",63
12914,"It rejects the quasi-sciences, which are founded on an act of arbitrary will alone, such as Heraldry
- EnL",106
12915,"Sciences of this class are positive from beginning to end
- EnL",63
12916,"In another class of sciences, also styled positive, but which have a rational basis and a rational beginning, philosophy claims that constituent as its own
- EnL",161
12917,"The positive features remain the property of the sciences themselves
- EnL",74
12918,"The positive element in the last class of sciences is of different sorts
- EnL",78
12919,"In this region of chance and change, the adequate notion of science must yield its place to reasons or grounds of explanation
- EnL",131
12920,"Thus, eg in the science of jurisprudence, or in the system of direct and indirect taxation, it is necessary to have certain points precisely and definitively settled which lie beyond the competence of the absolute lines laid down by the pure notion
- EnL",254
12921,"A certain latitude of settlement accordingly is left: and each point may be determined in one way on one principle, in another way on another, and admits of no definitive certainty
- EnL",186
12922,"Similarly the Idea of Nature, when parcelled out in detail, is dissipated into contingencies
- EnL",98
12923,"Natural history, geography, and medicine stumble upon descriptions of existence, upon kinds and distinctions, which are not determined by reason, but by sport and adventitious incidents
- EnL",191
12924,"Even history comes under the same category
- EnL",48
12925,"The Idea is its essence and inner nature; but, as it appears, everything is under contingency and in the field of voluntary action
- EnL",136
12926,"They assume their statements to possess an authority beyond appeal
- EnL",72
12927,"Here the fault lies in the finitude of the form, as in the previous instance it lay in the matter
- EnL",103
12928,"Under this head we must also class the philosophy which proposes to build upon anthropology,' facts of consciousness, inward sense, or outward experience
- EnL",159
12929,"It may happen, however, that empirical is an epithet applicable only to the form of scientific exposition; whilst intuitive sagacity has arranged what are mere phenomena, according to the essential sequence of the notion
- EnL",226
12930,"In such a case the contrasts between the varied and numerous phenomena brought together serve to eliminate the external and accidental circumstances of their conditions, and the universal thus comes clearly into view
- EnL",222
12931,"Guided by such an intuition, experimental physics will present the rational science of Nature,--as history will present the science of human affairs and actions--in an external picture, which mirrors the philosophic notion
- EnL",228
12932,"It may seem as if philosophy, in order to start on its course, had, like the rest of the sciences, to begin with a subjective presupposition
- EnL",146
12933,"The sciences postulate their respective objects, such as space, number, or whatever it be; and it might be supposed that philosophy had also to postulate the existence of thought
- EnL",184
12934,"But the two cases are not exactly parallel
- EnL",48
12935,"It is by the free act of thought that it occupies a point of view, in which it is for its own self, and thus gives itself an object of its own production
- EnL",159
12936,"Nor is this all
- EnL",21
12937,"The very point of view, which originally is taken on its own evidence only, must in the course of the science be converted to a result,--the ultimate result in which philosophy returns into itself and reaches the point with which it began
- EnL",244
12938,"In this manner philosophy exhibits the appearance of a circle which closes with itself, and has no beginning in the same way as the other sciences have
- EnL",157
12939,"To speak of a beginning of philosophy has a meaning only in relation to a person who proposes to commence the study, and not in relation to the science as science
- EnL",168
12940,"The same thing may be thus expressed
- EnL",42
12942,"This is in short the one single aim, action, and goal of philosophy--to arrive at the notion of its notion, and thus secure its return and its satisfaction
- EnL",161
12943,"As the whole science, and only the whole, can exhibit what the Idea or system of reason is, it is impossible to give in a preliminary way a general impression of a philosophy
- EnL",180
12944,"Nor can a division of philosophy into its parts be intelligible, except in connexion with the system
- EnL",106
12945,"A preliminary division, like the limited conception from which it comes, can only be an anticipation
- EnL",106
12947,"Logic, the science of the Idea in and for itself
- EnL",54
12948,"The Philosophy of Nature: the science of the Idea in its otherness
- EnL",72
12949,"The Philosophy of Mind: the science of the Idea come back to itself out of that otherness
- EnL",95
12950,"As observed in § 15, the differences between the several philosophical sciences are only aspects or specialisations of the one Idea or system of reason, which and which alone is alike exhibited in these different media
- EnL",224
12951,"In Nature nothing else would have to be discerned, except the Idea: but the Idea has here divested itself of its proper being
- EnL",131
12952,"In Mind, again, the Idea has asserted a being of its own, and is on the way to become absolute
- EnL",100
12954,"To represent the relation between them as a division, therefore, leads to misconception; for it co-ordinates the several parts or sciences one beside another, as if they had no innate development, but were, like so many species, really and radically distinct
- EnL",264
12955,"We can easily guess from the title what sort of subjects are here to be understood under the term 'philosophy'
- EnL",116
12956,"Among the advertisements of books just published, I lately found the following notice in an English newspaper: 'The Art of Preserving the Hair, on Philosophical Principles, neatly printed in post 8vo, price seven shillings'
- EnL",229
12957,"By philosophical principles for the preservation of the hair are probably meant chemical or physiological principles
- EnL",122
12959,"Nor is this language confined to members of the Opposition
- EnL",64
12962,"LOGIC IS THE SCIENCE OF THE PURE IDEA; pure, that is, because the Idea is in the abstract medium of Thought
- EnL",113
12963,"This definition, and the others which occur in these introductory outlines, are derived from a survey of the whole system, to which accordingly they are subsequent
- EnL",169
12964,"The same remark applies to all prefatory notions whatever about philosophy
- EnL",80
12965,"Logic might have been defined as the science of thought, and of its laws and characteristic forms
- EnL",103
12966,"But thought, as thought, constitutes only the general medium, or qualifying circumstance, which renders the Idea distinctively logical
- EnL",140
12967,"If we identify the Idea with thought, thought must not be taken in the sense of a method or form, but in the sense of the self-developing totality of its laws and peculiar terms
- EnL",183
12968,"These laws are the work of thought itself, and not a fact which it finds and must submit to
- EnL",97
12970,"Logic is easy, because its facts are nothing but our own thought and its familiar forms or terms: and these are the acme of simplicity, the abc of everything else
- EnL",168
12971,"They are also what we are best acquainted with: such as, 'Is' and 'Is not': quality and magnitude: being potential and being actual: one, many, and so on
- EnL",159
12973,"The utility of Logic is a matter which concerns its bearings upon the student, and the training it may give for other purposes
- EnL",132
12974,"This logical training consists in the exercise in thinking which the student has to go through (this science is the thinking of thinking): and in the fact that he stores his head with thoughts, in their native unalloyed character
- EnL",235
12975,"It is true that Logic, being the absolute form of truth, and another name for the very truth itself, is something more than merely useful
- EnL",143
12976,"Yet if what is noblest, most liberal and most independent is also most useful, Logic has some claim to the latter character
- EnL",129
12977,"Its utility must then be estimated at another rate than exercise in thought for the sake of the exercise
- EnL",110
12978,"The simplest and most intelligible answer to this question is that Truth is the object of Logic
- EnL",101
12979,"Truth is a noble word, and the thing is nobler still
- EnL",58
12980,"So long as man is sound at heart and in spirit, the search for truth must awake all the enthusiasm of his nature
- EnL",118
12981,"But immediately there steps in the objection--Are we able to know truth?
- EnL",78
12982,"There seems to be a disproportion between finite beings like ourselves and the truth which is absolute: and doubts suggest themselves whether there is any bridge between the finite and the infinite
- EnL",203
12983,"God is truth: how shall we know Him?
- EnL",42
12984,"Such an undertaking appears to stand in contradiction with the graces of lowliness and humility--Others who ask whether we can know the truth have a different purpose
- EnL",172
12985,"They want to justify themselves in living on contented with their petty, finite aims
- EnL",90
12986,"And humility of this stamp is a poor thing
- EnL",48
12987,"But the time is past when people asked: How shall I, a poor worm of the dust, be able to know the truth?
- EnL",110
12988,"And in its stead we find vanity and conceit: people claim, without any trouble on their part, to breathe the very atmosphere of truth
- EnL",139
12989,"The young have been flattered into the belief that they possess a natural birthright of moral and religious truth
- EnL",119
12990,"And in the same strain, those of riper years are declared to be sunk, petrified, ossified in falsehood
- EnL",108
12991,"Youth, say these teachers, sees the bright light of dawn: but the older generation lies in the slough and mire of the common day
- EnL",134
12992,"They admit that the special sciences are something that certainly ought to be cultivated, but merely as the means to satisfy the needs of outer life
- EnL",154
12993,"In all this it is not humility which holds back from the knowledge and study of the truth, but a conviction that we are already in full possession of it
- EnL",158
12994,"And no doubt the young carry with them the hopes of their elder compeers; on them rests the advance of the world and science
- EnL",130
12995,"But these hopes are set upon the young, only on the condition that, instead of remaining as they are, they undertake the stern labour of mind
- EnL",147
12996,"This modesty in truth-seeking has still another phase: and that is the genteel indifference to truth, as we see it in Pilate's conversation with Christ
- EnL",157
12997,"When it comes to this, nothing is left but self-conceit
- EnL",61
12998,"The knowledge of the truth meets an additional obstacle in timidity
- EnL",73
12999,"A slothful mind finds it natural to say: 'Don't let it be supposed that we mean to be in earnest with our philosophy
- EnL",122
13000,"We shall be glad inter alia to study Logic: but Logic must be sure to leave us as we were before'
- EnL",103
13001,"People have a feeling that, if thinking passes the ordinary range of our ideas and impressions, it cannot but be on the evil road
- EnL",135
13002,"They seem to be trusting themselves to a sea on which they will be tossed to and fro by the waves of thought, till at length they again reach the sandbank of this temporal scene, as utterly poor as when they left it
- EnL",221
13003,"What coines of such a view, we see in the world
- EnL",53
13004,"It is possible within these limits to gain varied information and many accomplishments, to become a master of official routine, and to be trained for special purposes
- EnL",172
13005,"But it is quite another thing to educate the spirit for the higher life and to devote our energies to its service
- EnL",119
13006,"In our own day it may be hoped a longing for something better has sprung up among the young, so that they will not be contented with the mere straw of outer knowledge
- EnL",172
13007,"But of thought our estimate may be very mean, or it may be very high
- EnL",74
13008,"On one hand, people say: 'It is only a thought'
- EnL",53
13009,"In their view thought is subjective, arbitrary and accidental--distinguished from the thing itself, from the true and the real
- EnL",132
13010,"On the other hand, a very high estimate may be formed of thought; when thought alone is held adequate to attain the highest of all things, the nature of God, of which the senses can tell us nothing
- EnL",203
13011,"God is a spirit, it is said, and must be worshipped in spirit and in truth
- EnL",80
13012,"But the merely felt and sensible, we admit, is not the spiritual; its heart of hearts is in thought; and only spirit can know spirit
- EnL",138
13013,"And though it is true that spirit can demean itself as feeling and sense--as is the case in religion, the mere feeling, as a mode of consciousness, is one thing, and its contents another
- EnL",192
13014,"Feeling, as feeling, is the general form of the sensuous nature which we have in common with the brutes
- EnL",109
13015,"This form, viz feeling, may possibly seize and appropriate the full organic truth: but the form has no real congruity with its contents
- EnL",141
13016,"The form of feeling is the lowest in which spiritual truth can be expressed
- EnL",81
13017,"The world of spiritual existences, God himself, exists in proper truth, only in thought and as thought
- EnL",108
13018,"If this be so, there fore, thought, far from being a mere thought, is the highest and, in strict accuracy, the sole mode of apprehending the eternal and absolute
- EnL",167
13019,"As of thought, so also of the science of thought, a very high or a very low opinion may be formed
- EnL",103
13020,"Any man, it is supposed, can think without Logic, as he can digest without studying physiology
- EnL",100
13021,"If he have studied Logic, he thinks afterwards as he did before, perhaps more methodically, but with little alteration
- EnL",124
13022,"If this were all, and if Logic did no more than make men acquainted with the action of thought as the faculty of comparison and classification, it would produce nothing which had not been done quite as well before
- EnL",219
13023,"And in point of fact Logic hitherto had no other idea of its duty than this
- EnL",81
13024,"Yet to be well-informed about thought, even as a mere activity of the subject-mind, is honourable and interesting for man
- EnL",127
13025,"It is in knowing what he is and what he does, that man is distinguished from the brutes
- EnL",93
13026,"But we may take the higher estimate of thought--as what alone can get really in touch with the supreme and true
- EnL",117
13027,"In that case, Logic as the science of thought occupies a high ground
- EnL",74
13029,"Mathematics is concerned with the abstractions of time and space
- EnL",70
13030,"But these are still the object of sense, although the sensible is abstract and idealised
- EnL",94
13031,"Thought bids adieu even to this last and abstract sensible: it asserts its own native independence, renounces the field of the external and internal sense, and puts away the interests and inclinations of the individual
- EnL",224
13032,"In earlier days men meant no harm by thinking: they thought away freely and fearlessly
- EnL",92
13033,"They thought about God, about Nature, and the State; and they felt sure that a knowledge of the truth was obtainable through thought only, and not through the senses or any random ideas or opinions
- EnL",203
13034,"But while they so thought, the principal ordinances of life began to be seriously affected by their conclusions
- EnL",117
13035,"Thought deprived existing institutions of their force
- EnL",59
13036,"Constitutions fell a victim to thought: religion was assailed by thought: firm religious beliefs which had been always looked upon as revelations were undermined, and in many minds the old faith was upset
- EnL",210
13037,"The Greek philosophers, for example, became antagonists of the old religion, and destroyed its beliefs
- EnL",108
13038,"Philosophers were accordingly banished or put to death, as revolutionists who had subverted religion and the state, two things which were inseparable
- EnL",155
13039,"Thought, in short, made itself a power in the real world, and exercised enormous influence
- EnL",96
13040,"The matter ended by drawing attention to the influence of thought, and its claims were submitted to a more rigorous scrutiny, by which the world professed to find that thought arrogated too much and was unable to perform what it had undertaken
- EnL",249
13041,"It had not--people said--learned the real being of God, of Nature and Mind
- EnL",80
13042,"It had not learned what the truth was
- EnL",43
13043,"What it had done, was to overthrow religion and the state
- EnL",63
13044,"It became urgent therefore to justify thought, with reference to the results it had produced: and it is this examination into the nature of thought and this justification which in recent times has constituted one of the main problems of philosophy
- EnL",253
13046,"The product of this activity, the form or character peculiar to thought, is the UNIVERSAL, or, in general, the abstract
- EnL",125
13047,"Thought, regarded as an activity, may be accordingly described as the active universal, and, since the deed, its product, is the universal once more, may be called a self-actualising universal
- EnL",198
13048,"Thought conceived as a subject (agent) is a thinker, and the subject existing as a thinker is simply denoted by the term 'I'
- EnL",130
13049,"The propositions giving an account of thought in this and the following sections are not offered as assertions or opinions of mine on the matter
- EnL",150
13050,"But in these preliminary chapters any deduction or proof would be impossible, and the statements may be taken as matters in evidence
- EnL",138
13051,"In other words, every man, when he thinks and considers his thoughts, will discover by the experience of his consciousness that they possess the character of universality as well as the other aspects of thought to be afterwards enumerated
- EnL",244
13052,"We assume of course that his powers of attention and abstraction have undergone a previous training, enabling him to observe correctly the evidence of his consciousness and his conceptions
- EnL",194
13053,"This introductory exposition has already alluded to the distinction between Sense, Conception, and Thought
- EnL",112
13054,"As the distinction is of capital importance for understanding the nature and kinds of knowledge, it will help to explain matters if we here call attention to it
- EnL",166
13055,"For the explanation of Sense, the readiest method certainly is, to refer to its external source--the organs of sense
- EnL",122
13056,"But to name the organ does not help much to explain what is apprehended by it
- EnL",83
13058,"Conception or picture-thinking works with materials from the same sensuous source
- EnL",87
13059,"But these materials when conceived are expressly characterised as in me and therefore mine: and secondly, as universal, or simple, because only referred to self
- EnL",166
13060,"Nor is sense the only source of materialised conception
- EnL",61
13062,"For it is a thought of which such conception is the vehicle, and there is no want of the form of universality, without which no content could be in me, or be a conception at all
- EnL",183
13063,"Yet here also the peculiarity of conception is, generally speaking, to be sought in the individualism or isolation of its contents
- EnL",136
13064,"True it is that, for example, law and legal provisions do not exist in a sensible space, mutually excluding one another
- EnL",125
13065,"Nor as regards time, though they appear to some extent in succession, are their contents themselves conceived as affected by time, or as transient and changeable in it
- EnL",173
13066,"The fault in conception lies deeper
- EnL",41
13067,"These ideas, though implicitly possessing the organic unity of mind, stand isolated here and there on the broad ground of conception, with its inward and abstract generality
- EnL",179
13068,"Thus cut adrift, each is simple, unrelated: Right, Duty, God
- EnL",66
13071,"The difference between conception and thought is of special importance: because philosophy may be said to do nothing but transform conceptions into thoughts,--though it works the further transformation of a mere thought into a notion
- EnL",239
13072,"Sensible existence has been characterised by the attributes of individuality and mutual exclusion of the members
- EnL",118
13073,"It is well to remember that these very attributes of sense are thoughts and general terms
- EnL",95
13074,"It will be shown in the Logic that thought (and the universal) is not a mere opposite of sense: it lets nothing escape it, but, outflanking its other, is at once that other and itself
- EnL",189
13075,"Now language is the work of thought: and hence all that is expressed in language must be universal
- EnL",104
13076,"What I only mean or suppose is mine: it belongs to me,--this particular individual
- EnL",88
13077,"But language expresses nothing but universality; and so I cannot say what I merely mean
- EnL",93
13078,"And the unutterable,--feeling or sensation,--far from being the highest truth, is the most unimportant and untrue
- EnL",119
13079,"If I say 'The individual,' 'This individual,' 'here,' 'now,' all these are universal terms
- EnL",96
13080,"Everything and anything is an individual, a 'this,' and if it be sensible, is here and now
- EnL",96
13081,"Similarly when I say, 'I,' I mean my single self to the exclusion of all others: but what I say, viz 'I,' is just every 'I,' which in like manner excludes all others from itself
- EnL",183
13082,"In an awkward expression which Kant used, he said that I accompany all my conceptions,--sensations, too, desires, actions, &c 'I' is in essence and act the universal: and such partnership is a form, though an external form, of universality
- EnL",245
13083,"All other men have it in common with me to be 'I': just as it is common to all my sensations and conceptions to be mine
- EnL",125
13084,"But 'I,' in the abstract, as such, is the mere act of self-concentration or self-relation, in which we make abstraction from all conception and feeling, from every state of mind and every peculiarity of nature, talent, and experience
- EnL",239
13085,"To this extent, 'I' is the existence of a wholly abstract universality, a principle of abstract freedom
- EnL",109
13086,"Hence thought, viewed as a subject, is what is expressed by the word 'I': and since I am at the same time in all my sensations, conceptions, and states of consciousness, thought is everywhere present, and is a category that runs through all these modifications
- EnL",266
13087,"Our first impression when we use the term thought is of a subjective activity--one amongst many similar faculties, such as memory, imagination and will
- EnL",157
13088,"It might in that case seem arbitrary to devote a special science to thought, whilst will, imagination and the rest were denied the same privilege
- EnL",151
13089,"The selection of one faculty however might even in this view be very well grounded on a certain authority acknowledged to belong to thought, and on its claim to be regarded as the true nature of man, in which consists his distinction from the brutes
- EnL",255
13090,"Nor is it unimportant to study thought even as a subjective energy
- EnL",72
13091,"A detailed analysis of its nature would exhibit rules and laws, a knowledge of which is derived from experience
- EnL",117
13092,"A treatment of the laws of thought, from this point of view, used once to form the body of logical science
- EnL",112
13093,"Of that science Aristotle was the founder
- EnL",47
13094,"He succeeded in assigning to thought what properly belongs to it
- EnL",70
13095,"Our thought is extremely concrete: but in its composite contents we must distinguish the part that properly belongs to thought, or to the abstract mode of its action
- EnL",171
13096,"A subtle spiritual bond, consisting in the agency of thought, is what gives unity to all these contents, and it was this bond, the form as form, that Aristotle noted and described
- EnL",185
13097,"Up to the present day, the logic of Aristotle continues to be the received system
- EnL",87
13098,"It has indeed been spun out to greater length, especially by the labours of the medieval Schoolmen who, without making any material additions, merely refined in details
- EnL",174
13099,"The moderns also have left their mark upon this logic, partly by omitting many points of logical doctrine due to Aristotle and the Schoolmen, and partly by foisting in a quantity of psychological matter
- EnL",208
13100,"The purport of the science is to become acquainted with the procedure of finite thought: and, if it is adapted to its pre-supposed object, the science is entitled to be styled correct
- EnL",189
13101,"The study of this formal logic undoubtedly has its uses
- EnL",61
13102,"It sharpens the wits, as the phrase goes, and teaches us to collect our thoughts and to abstract --whereas in common consciousness we have to deal with sensuous conceptions which cross and perplex one another
- EnL",214
13103,"Abstraction moreover implies the concentration of the mind on a single point, and thus induces the habit of attending to our inward selves
- EnL",144
13104,"An acquaintance with the forms of finite thought may be made a means of training the mind for the empirical sciences, since their method is regulated by these forms: and in this sense logic has been designated Instrumental
- EnL",228
13105,"It is true, we may be still more liberal, and say: Logic is to be studied not for its utility, but for its own sake; the super-excellent is not to be sought for the sake of mere utility
- EnL",191
13106,"In one sense this is quite correct: but it may be replied that the super-excellent is also the most useful: because it is the all-sustaining principle which, having a subsistence of its own, may therefore serve as the vehicle of special ends which it furthers and secures
- EnL",277
13107,"And thus, special ends, though they have no right to be set first, are still fostered by the presence of the highest good
- EnL",127
13108,"Religion, for instance, has an absolute value of its own; yet at the same time other ends flourish and succeed in its train
- EnL",129
13109,"As Christ says: 'Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you'
- EnL",102
13110,"Particular ends can be attained only in the attainment of what absolutely is and exists in its own right
- EnL",110
13111,"We now, in the second place, consider this action in its bearings upon objects, or as reflection upon something
- EnL",117
13112,"In this case the universal or product of its operation contains the value of the thing--is the essential, inward, and true
- EnL",128
13114,"To reflect is a lesson which even the child has to learn
- EnL",62
13115,"One of his first lessons is to join adjectives with substantives
- EnL",70
13116,"This obliges him to attend and distinguish: he has to remember a rule and apply it to the particular case
- EnL",111
13117,"This rule is nothing but a universal: and the child must see that the particular adapts itself to this universal
- EnL",118
13118,"In life, again, we have ends to attain
- EnL",44
13119,"And with regard to these we ponder which is the best way to secure them
- EnL",77
13120,"The end here represents the universal or governing principle: and we have means and instruments whose action we regulate in conformity to the end
- EnL",151
13121,"In the same way reflection is active in questions of conduct
- EnL",66
13122,"To reflect here means to recollect the right, the duty,--the universal which serves as a fixed rule' to guide our behaviour in the given case
- EnL",147
13123,"Our particular act must imply and recognise the universal law--We find the same thing exhibited in our study of natural phenomena
- EnL",135
13124,"For instance, we observe thunder and lightning
- EnL",52
13125,"The phenomenon is a familiar one, and we often perceive it
- EnL",64
13126,"But man is not content with a bare acquaintance, or with the fact as it appears to the senses; he would like to get behind the surface, to know what it is, and to comprehend it
- EnL",182
13127,"This leads him to reflect: he seeks to find out the cause as something distinct from the mere phenomenon: he tries to know the inside in its distinction from the outside
- EnL",175
13128,"Hence the phenomenon becomes double, it splits into inside and outside, into force and its manifestation, into cause and effect
- EnL",133
13129,"Once more we find the inside or the force identified with the universal and permanent: not this or that flash of lightning, this or that plant--but that which continues the same in them all
- EnL",195
13130,"The sensible appearance is individual and evanescent: the permanent in it is discovered by
- EnL",96
13131,"Nature shows us a countless number of individual forms and phenomena
- EnL",74
13132,"Into this variety we feel a need of introducing unity: we compare, consequently, and try to find the universal of each single case
- EnL",136
13133,"Individuals are born and perish: the species abides and recurs in them all: and its existence is only visible to reflection
- EnL",129
13134,"Under the same head fall such laws as those regulating the motion of the heavenly bodies
- EnL",94
13135,"To-day we see the stars here, and to-morrow there: and our mind finds something incongruous, in this chaos--something in which it can put no faith, because it believes in order and in a simple, constant, and universal law
- EnL",227
13136,"Inspired by this belief, the mind has directed its reflection towards the phenomena, and learnt their laws
- EnL",112
13137,"In other words, it has established the movement of the heavenly bodies to be in accordance with a universal law from which every change of position may be known and predicted
- EnL",180
13138,"The case is the same with the influences which make themselves felt in the infinite complexity of human conduct
- EnL",117
13139,"There, too, man has the belief in the sway of a general principle--From all these examples it may be gathered how reflection is always seeking for something fixed and permanent, definite in itself and governing the particulars
- EnL",232
13140,"This universal which cannot be apprehended by the senses counts as the true and essential
- EnL",95
13141,"Thus, duties and rights are all-important in the matter of conduct: and an action is true when it conforms to those universal formulae
- EnL",140
13142,"In thus characterising the universal, we become aware of its antithesis to something else
- EnL",95
13143,"This something else is the merely immediate, outward and individual, as opposed to the mediate, inward and universal
- EnL",122
13144,"The universal does not exist externally to the outward eye as a universal
- EnL",79
13145,"The kind as kind cannot be perceived: the laws of the celestial motions are not written on the sky
- EnL",104
13146,"The universal is neither seen nor heard, its existence is only for the mind
- EnL",81
13147,"Religion leads us to a universal, which embraces all else within itself, to an Absolute by which all else is brought into being: and this Absolute is an object not of the senses but of the mind and of thought
- EnL",214
13148,"Thus, as it appears, an alteration of the object must be interposed before its true nature can be discovered
- EnL",114
13149,"What reflection elicits, is a product of our thought
- EnL",58
13150,"Solon, for instance, produced out of his head the laws he gave to the Athenians
- EnL",85
13151,"This is half of the truth: but we must not on that account forget that the universal (in Solon's case, the laws) is the very reverse of merely subjective, or fail to note that it is the essential, true, and objective being of things
- EnL",238
13152,"To discover the truth in things, mere attention is not enough; we must call in the action of our own faculties to transform what is immediately before us
- EnL",159
13153,"Now, at first sight, this seems an inversion of the natural order, calculated to thwart the very purpose on which knowledge is bent
- EnL",137
13154,"But the method is not so irrational as it seems
- EnL",53
13155,"It has been the conviction of every age that the only way of reaching the permanent substratum was to transmute the given phenomenon by means of reflection
- EnL",161
13156,"In modern times a doubt has for the first time been raised on this point in connexion with the difference alleged to exist between the products of our thought and the things in their own nature
- EnL",199
13157,"This real nature of things, it is said, is very different from what we make out of them
- EnL",93
13158,"The divorce between thought and thing is mainly the work of the Critical Philosophy, and runs counter to the conviction of all previous ages, that their agreement was a matter of course
- EnL",191
13159,"The antithesis between them is the hinge on which modern philosophy turns
- EnL",79
13160,"Meanwhile the natural belief of men gives the lie to it
- EnL",61
13161,"In common life we reflect, without particularly reminding ourselves that this is the process of arriving at the truth, and we think without hesitation, and in the firm belief that thought coincides with thing
- EnL",214
13162,"And this belief is of the greatest importance
- EnL",51
13163,"It marks the diseased state of the age when we see it adopt the despairing creed that our knowledge is only subjective, and that beyond this subjective we cannot go
- EnL",170
13164,"Whereas, rightly understood, truth is objective, and ought so to regulate the conviction of every one, that the conviction of the individual is stamped as wrong when it does not agree with this rule
- EnL",204
13165,"Modern views, on the contrary, put great value on the mere fact of conviction, and hold that to be convinced is good for its own sake, whatever be the burden of our conviction,--there being no standard by which we can measure its truth
- EnL",241
13166,"If this be so, it also implies that everything we know both of outward and inward nature, in one word, the objective world, is in its own self the same as it is in thought, and that to think is to bring out the truth of our object, be it what it may
- EnL",255
13167,"The business of philosophy is only to bring into explicit consciousness what the world in all ages has believed about thought
- EnL",131
13168,"Philosophy therefore advances nothing new; and our present discussion has led us to a conclusion which agrees with the natural belief of mankind
- EnL",150
13169,"If this be so, the real nature is a product of my mind, in its character of thinking subject--generated by me in my simple universality, self-collected and removed from extraneous influences, --in one word, in my Freedom
- EnL",226
13170,"Think for yourself, is a phrase which people often use as if it had some special significance
- EnL",99
13171,"The fact is, no man can think for another, any more than he can eat or drink for him: and the expression is a pleonasm
- EnL",124
13173,"If this be admitted, and if we apply the term humility or modesty to an attitude where our subjectivity is not allowed to interfere by act or quality, it is easy to appreciate the question touching the humility or modesty and pride of philosophy
- EnL",251
13175,"In these circumstances philosophy may be acquitted of the charge of pride
- EnL",79
13176,"And when Aristotle summons the mind to rise to the dignity of that attitude, the dignity he seeks is won by letting slip all our individual opinions and prejudices, and submitting to the sway of the fact
- EnL",209
13177,"With these explanations and qualifications, thoughts may be termed Objective Thoughts,--among which are also to be included the forms which are more especially discussed in the common logic, where they are usually treated as forms of conscious thought only
- EnL",262
13178,"Logic therefore coincides with Metaphysics, the science of things set and held in thoughts,--thoughts accredited able to express the essential reality of things
- EnL",166
13179,"An exposition of the relation in which such forms as notion, judgment, and syllogism stand to others, such as causality, is a matter for the science itself
- EnL",161
13180,"But this much is evident beforehand
- EnL",41
13181,"If thought tries to form a notion of things, this notion (as well as its proximate phases, the judgment and syllogism) cannot be composed of articles and relations which are alien and irrelevant to the things
- EnL",214
13182,"Reflection, it was said above, conducts to the universal of things: which universal is itself one of the constituent factors of a notion
- EnL",142
13183,"To say that Reason or Understanding is in the world, is equivalent in its import to the phrase 'Objective Thought'
- EnL",120
13184,"The latter phrase however has the inconvenience that thought is usually confined to express what belongs to the mind or consciousness only, while objective is a term applied, at least primarily, only to the non-mental
- EnL",223
13185,"It would be necessary, therefore, if we use the term thought at all, to speak of nature as the system of unconscious thought, or, to use Schelling's expression, a petrified intelligence
- EnL",191
13186,"And in order to prevent misconception, thought-form or thought-type should be substituted for the ambiguous term thought
- EnL",126
13187,"From what has been said the principles of logic are to be sought in a system of thought-types or fundamental categories, in which the opposition between subjective and objective, in its usual sense, vanishes
- EnL",213
13189,"Another illustration is offered by the circumstance that in speaking of some definite animal we say it is (an) animal
- EnL",123
13190,"Now, the animal, quâ animal, cannot be shown; nothing can be pointed out excepting some special animal
- EnL",108
13191,"Animal, quâ animal, does not exist: it is merely the universal nature of the individual animals, whilst each existing animal is a more concretely, defined and particularised thing
- EnL",185
13192,"But to be an animal,--the law of kind which is the universal in this case,--is the property of the particular animal, and constitutes its definite essence
- EnL",160
13193,"Take away from the dog its animality, and it becomes impossible to say what it is
- EnL",87
13194,"All things have a permanent inward nature, as well as an outward existence
- EnL",80
13195,"They live and die, arise and pass away; but their essential and universal part is the kind; and this means much more than something common to them all
- EnL",156
13196,"If thought is the constitutive substance of external things, it is also the universal substance of what is spiritual
- EnL",122
13197,"In all human perception thought is present; so too thought is the universal in all the acts of conception and recollection; in short, in every mental activity, in willing, wishing and the like
- EnL",198
13198,"All these faculties are only further, specialisations of thought
- EnL",70
13199,"When it is seen, to be the true universal of all that nature and mind contain, it extends its scope far beyond all these, and becomes the basis of everything
- EnL",163
13200,"From this view of thought, in its objective meaning as greek: nous, we may next pass to consider the subjective sense of the term
- EnL",135
13201,"Man is a thinker, and is universal: but he is a thinker only because he feels his own universality
- EnL",104
13202,"The animal too is by implication universal, but the universal is not consciously felt by it to be universal: it feels only the individual
- EnL",143
13203,"The animal sees a singular object, for instance, its food, or a man
- EnL",73
13204,"For the animal all this never goes beyond an individual thing
- EnL",67
13205,"Similarly, sensation has to do with nothing but singulars, such as this pain or this sweet taste
- EnL",102
13206,"Nature does not bring its ""νοῦς"" into consciousness: it is man who first makes himself double so as to be a universal for a universal
- EnL",139
13207,"This first happens when man knows that he is 'I'
- EnL",54
13208,"By the term 'I' I mean myself, a single and altogether determinate person
- EnL",79
13209,"And yet I really utter nothing peculiar to myself, for every one else is an 'I' or 'Ego,' and when I call myself 'I,' though I indubitably mean the single person myself, I express a thorough universal
- EnL",206
13210,"What I have in my consciousness, is for me
- EnL",48
13211,"Every man is a whole world of conceptions, that lie buried in the night of the 'Ego'
- EnL",90
13212,"It follows that the 'Ego' is the universal in which we leave aside all that is particular, and in which at the same time all the particulars have a latent existence
- EnL",170
13213,"In other words, it is not a mere universality and nothing more, but the universality which includes in it everything
- EnL",122
13214,"Commonly we use the word 'I' without attaching much importance to it, nor is it an object of study except to philosophical analysis
- EnL",137
13215,"In the 'Ego,' we have thought before us in its utter purity
- EnL",65
13216,"Now in the 'Ego' there are a variety of contents, derived both from within and from, without, and according to the nature of these contents our state may be described as perception, or conception, or reminiscence
- EnL",218
13217,"But in all of them the 'I' is found: or in them all thought is present
- EnL",76
13219,"In the case of our ordinary conceptions, two things may happen
- EnL",68
13220,"Either the contents are moulded by thought, but not the form: or, the form belongs to thought and not the contents
- EnL",120
13221,"In using such terms, for instance, as anger, rose, hope, I am speaking of things which I have learnt in the way of sensation, but I express these contents in a universal mode, that is, in the form of thought
- EnL",213
13222,"I have left out much that is particular and given the contents in their generality: but still the contents remain sense-derived
- EnL",133
13223,"On the other hand, when I represent God, the content is undeniably a product of pure thought, but the form still retains the sensuous limitations which it has as I find it immediately present in myself
- EnL",207
13224,"In these generalised images the content is not merely and simply sensible, as it is in a visual inspection; but either the content is sensuous and the form appertains to thought, or vice versâ
- EnL",198
13225,"In the first case the material is given to us, and our thought supplies the form: in the second case the content which has its source in thought is by means of the form turned into a something given, which accordingly reaches the mind from without
- EnL",253
13226,"In the ordinary sense of the term, by thought we generally represent to ourselves something more than simple and unmixed thought; we mean some thought, the material of which is from experience
- EnL",198
13227,"It is in these circumstances that thoughts are pure thoughts
- EnL",66
13228,"The mind is then in its own home-element and therefore free: for freedom means that the other thing with which you deal is a second self--so that you never leave your own ground but give the law to yourself
- EnL",212
13229,"In the impulses or appetites the beginning is from something else, from something which we feel to be external
- EnL",116
13230,"In this case then we speak of dependence
- EnL",46
13231,"For freedom it is necessary that we should feel no presence of something else which is not ourselves
- EnL",106
13232,"The natural man, whose motions follow the rule only of his appetites, is not his own master
- EnL",97
13233,"Be he as self-willed as he may, the constituents of his will and opinion are not his own, and his freedom is merely formal
- EnL",128
13234,"But when we think, we renounce our selfish and particular being, sink ourselves in the thing, allow thought to follow its own course, and,--if we add anything of our own, we think ill
- EnL",189
13236,"Their problem in that case is only to recognise the logical forms under the shapes they assume in Nature and Mind,--shapes which are only a particular mode of expression for the forms of pure thought
- EnL",205
13237,"If for instance we take the syllogism (not as it was understood in the old formal logic, but at its real value), we shall find it gives expression to the law that the particular is the middle term which fuses together the extremes of the universal and the singular
- EnL",270
13238,"The syllogistic form is a universal form of all things
- EnL",60
13239,"Everything that exists is a particular, which couples together the universal and the singular
- EnL",99
13240,"But Nature is weak and fails to exhibit the logical forms in their purity
- EnL",79
13241,"Such a feeble exemplification of the syllogism may be seen in the magnet
- EnL",78
13242,"In the middle or point of indifference of a magnet, its two poles, however they may be distinguished, are brought into one
- EnL",128
13243,"Physics also teaches us to see the universal or essence in Nature: and the only difference between it and the Philosophy of Nature is that the latter brings before our mind the adequate forms of the notion in the physical world
- EnL",233
13244,"It will now be understood that Logic is the all-animating spirit of all the sciences, and its categories the spiritual hierarchy
- EnL",134
13245,"They are the heart and centre of things: and yet at the same time they are always on our lips, and, apparently at least, perfectly familiar objects
- EnL",153
13246,"But things thus familiar are usually the greatest strangers
- EnL",65
13247,"Being, for example, is a category of pure thought: but to make 'Is' an object of investigation never occurs to us
- EnL",119
13248,"Common fancy puts the Absolute far away in a world beyond
- EnL",63
13249,"The Absolute is rather directly before us, so present that so long as we think, we must, though without express consciousness of it, always carry it with us and always use it
- EnL",180
13250,"Language is the main depository of these types of thought; and one use of the grammatical instruction which children receive is unconsciously to turn their attention to distinctions of thought
- EnL",198
13251,"Logic is usually said to be concerned with forms only and to derive the material for them from elsewhere
- EnL",110
13252,"But this 'only,' which assumes that the logical thoughts are nothing in comparison with the rest of the contents, is not the word to use about forms which are the absolutely-real ground of everything
- EnL",205
13253,"Everything else rather is an 'only' compared with these thoughts
- EnL",70
13255,"If we thus acted, we should proceed from observation and experience, and should, for instance, say we habitually employ the term 'force' in such a case, and such a meaning
- EnL",177
13256,"A definition like that would be called correct, if it agreed with the conception of its object present in our ordinary state of mind
- EnL",138
13257,"The defect of this empirical method is that a notion is not defined as it is in and for itself, but in terms of something assumed, which is then used as a criterion and standard of correctness
- EnL",198
13258,"No such test need be applied: we have merely to let the thought-forms follow the impulse of their own organic life
- EnL",120
13259,"To ask if a category is true or not, must sound strange to the ordinary mind: for a category apparently becomes true only when it is applied to a given object, and apart from this application it would seem meaningless to inquire into its truth
- EnL",249
13260,"But this is the very question on which everything turns
- EnL",61
13261,"We must however in the first place understand clearly what we mean by Truth
- EnL",81
13262,"In common life truth means the agreement of an object with our conception of it
- EnL",85
13263,"We thus pre-suppose an object to which our conception must conform
- EnL",72
13264,"In the philosophical sense of the word, on the other hand, truth may be described, in general abstract terms, as the agreement of a thought-content with itself
- EnL",165
13265,"This meaning is quite different from the one given above
- EnL",62
13266,"At the same time the deeper and philosophical meaning of truth can be partially traced even in the ordinary usage of language
- EnL",131
13267,"Thus we speak of a true friend; by which we mean a friend whose manner of conduct accords with the notion of friendship
- EnL",125
13268,"In the same way we speak of a true work of Art
- EnL",52
13269,"Untrue in this sense means the same as bad, or self-discordant
- EnL",68
13270,"In this sense a bad state is an untrue state; and evil and untruth may be said to consist in the contradiction subsisting between the function or notion and the existence of the object
- EnL",190
13271,"Of such a bad object we may form a correct representation, but the import of such representation is inherently false
- EnL",122
13272,"Of these correctnesses; which are at the same time untruths, we may have many in our heads--God alone is the thorough harmony of notion and reality
- EnL",153
13273,"All finite things involve an untruth: they have a notion and an existence, but their existence does not meet the requirements of the notion
- EnL",145
13274,"For this reason they must perish, and then the incompatibility between their notion and their existence becomes manifest
- EnL",126
13275,"It is in the kind that the individual animal has its notion: and the kind liberates itself from this individuality by death
- EnL",129
13276,"The study of truth, or, as it is here explained to mean, consistency, constitutes the proper problem of logic
- EnL",115
13277,"In our every-day mind we are never troubled with questions about the truth of the forms of thought--We may also express the problem of logic by saying that it examines the forms of thought touching their capability to hold truth
- EnL",234
13278,"And the question comes to this: What are the forms of the infinite, and what are the forms of the finite?
- EnL",111
13279,"Usually no suspicion attaches to the finite forms of thought; they are allowed to pass unquestioned
- EnL",105
13280,"But it is from conforming to finite categories in thought and action that all deception originates
- EnL",104
13281,"Experience is the first of these methods
- EnL",46
13282,"But the method is only a form: it has no intrinsic value of its own
- EnL",73
13283,"For in experience everything depends upon the mind we bring to bear upon actuality
- EnL",88
13284,"A great mind is great in its experience; and in the motley play of phenomena at once perceives the point of real significance
- EnL",131
13285,"The idea is present, in actual shape, not something, as it were, over the hill and far away
- EnL",97
13286,"The genius of a Goethe, for example, looking into nature or history, has great experiences, catches sight of the living principle, and gives expression to it
- EnL",163
13287,"A second method of apprehending the truth is Reflection, which defines it by intellectual relations of condition and conditioned
- EnL",134
13288,"But in these two modes the absolute truth has not yet found its appropriate form
- EnL",86
13289,"The most perfect method of knowledge proceeds in the pure form of thought: and here the attitude of man is one of entire freedom
- EnL",134
13290,"That the form of thought is the perfect form, and that it presents the truth as it intrinsically and actually is, is the general dogma of all philosophy
- EnL",158
13291,"To give a proof of the dogma there is, in the first instance, nothing to do but show that these other forms of knowledge are finite
- EnL",137
13292,"The grand Scepticism of antiquity accomplished this task when it exhibited the contradictions contained in every one of these forms
- EnL",137
13293,"That Scepticism indeed went further: but when it ventured to assail the forms of reason, it began by insinuating under them something finite upon which it might fasten
- EnL",173
13294,"All the forms of finite thought will make their appearance in the course of logical development, the order in which they present themselves being determined by necessary laws
- EnL",180
13295,"Here in the introduction they could only be unscientifically assumed as something given
- EnL",93
13296,"In the theory of logic itself these forms will be exhibited, not only on their negative, but also on their positive side
- EnL",126
13297,"It includes everything which the moralists term innocence as well as religious feeling, simple trust, love, fidelity, and natural faith
- EnL",141
13298,"The two other forms, first reflective, and secondly philosophical cognition, must leave that unsought natural harmony behind
- EnL",130
13299,"And so far as they have this in common, the methods which claim to apprehend the truth by thought may naturally be regarded as part and parcel of the pride which leads man to trust to his own powers for a knowledge of the truth
- EnL",233
13300,"Such a position involves a thorough-going disruption, and, viewed in that light, might be regarded as the source of all evil and wickedness--the original transgression
- EnL",173
13301,"Apparently therefore they only way of being reconciled and restored to peace is to surrender all claims to think or know
- EnL",126
13302,"This lapse from natural unity has not escaped notice, and nations from the earliest times have asked the meaning of the wonderful division of the spirit against itself
- EnL",173
13303,"No such inward disunion is found in nature: natural things do nothing wicked
- EnL",82
13304,"The Mosaic legend of the Fall of Man has preserved an ancient picture representing the origin and consequences of this disunion
- EnL",133
13305,"The incidents of the legend form the basis of an essential article of the creed, the doctrine of original sin in man and his consequent need of succour
- EnL",157
13306,"It may be well at the commencement of logic to examine the story which treats of the origin and the bearings of the very knowledge which logic has to discuss
- EnL",163
13307,"For, though philosophy must not allow herself to be overawed by religion, or accept the position of existence on sufferance, she cannot afford to neglect these popular conceptions
- EnL",185
13308,"The tales and allegories of religion, which have enjoyed for thousands of years the veneration of nations, are not to be set aside as antiquated even now
- EnL",159
13309,"Upon a closer inspection of the story of the Fall we find, as was already said, that it exemplifies the universal bearings of knowledge upon the spiritual life
- EnL",165
13310,"In its instinctive and natural stage, spiritual life wears the garb of innocence and confiding simplicity: but the very essence of spirit implies the absorption of this immediate condition in something higher
- EnL",214
13311,"The spiritual is distinguished from the natural, and more especially from the animal, life, in the circumstance that it does not continue a mere stream of tendency, but sunders itself to self-realisation
- EnL",209
13312,"But this position of severed life has in its turn to be suppressed, and the spirit has by its own act to win its way to concord again
- EnL",139
13313,"The final concord then is spiritual; that is, the principle of restoration is found in thought, and thought only
- EnL",118
13314,"The hand that inflicts the wound is also the hand which heals it
- EnL",70
13315,"God, it is said, had forbidden them to eat of the fruit of this latter tree: of the tree of life for the present nothing further is said
- EnL",142
13316,"These words evidently assume that man is not intended to seek knowledge, and ought to remain in the state of innocence
- EnL",124
13317,"Other meditative races, it may be remarked, have held the same belief that the primitive state of mankind was one of innocence and harmony
- EnL",144
13318,"Now all this is to a certain extent correct
- EnL",49
13319,"The disunion that appears throughout humanity is not a condition to rest in
- EnL",81
13320,"But it is a mistake to regard the natural and immediate harmony as the right state
- EnL",88
13321,"The mind is not mere instinct: on the contrary, it essentially involves the tendency to reasoning and meditation
- EnL",118
13322,"Childlike innocence no doubt has in it something fascinating and attractive: but only because it reminds us of what the spirit must win for itself
- EnL",152
13323,"The harmoniousness of childhood is a gift from the hand of nature: the second harmony must spring from the labour and culture of the spirit
- EnL",145
13324,"And so the words of Christ, 'Except ye become as little children,' &c, are very far from telling us that we must always remain children
- EnL",141
13325,"Again, we find in the narrative of Moses that the occasion which led man to leave his natural unity is attributed to solicitation from without
- EnL",148
13326,"The serpent was the tempter
- EnL",33
13327,"But the truth is, that the step into opposition, the awakening of consciousness, follows from the very nature of man: and the same history repeats itself in every son of Adam
- EnL",180
13328,"The serpent represents likeness to God as consisting in the knowledge of good and evil: and it is just this knowledge in which man participates when he breaks with the unity of his instinctive being and eats of the forbidden fruit
- EnL",236
13329,"The first reflection of awakened consciousness in men told them that they were naked
- EnL",90
13330,"This is a naïve and profound trait
- EnL",40
13331,"For the sense of shame bears evidence to the separation of man from his natural and sensuous life
- EnL",103
13332,"The beasts never get so far as this separation, and they feel no shame
- EnL",76
13333,"And it is in the human feeling of shame that we are to seek the spiritual and moral origin of dress, compared with which the merely physical need is a secondary matter
- EnL",173
13334,"Next comes the Curse, as it is called, which God pronounced upon man
- EnL",74
13335,"The prominent point in that curse turns chiefly on the contrast between man and nature
- EnL",92
13336,"Man must work in the sweat of his brow: and woman bring forth in sorrow
- EnL",77
13337,"As to work, if it is the result of the disunion, it is also the victory over it
- EnL",85
13338,"The beasts have nothing more to do but to pick up the materials required to satisfy their wants: man on the contrary can only satisfy his wants by himself producing and transforming the necessary means
- EnL",207
13339,"Thus even in these outside things man is dealing with himself
- EnL",67
13340,"The story does not close with the expulsion from Paradise
- EnL",63
13341,"Knowledge is now spoken of as divine, and not, as before, as something wrong and forbidden
- EnL",96
13342,"Such words contain a confutation of the idle talk that philosophy pertains only to the finitude of the mind
- EnL",113
13343,"Philosophy is knowledge, and it is through knowledge that man first realises his original vocation, to be the image of God
- EnL",128
13344,"Now while we accept the dogma, we must give up the setting of incident which represents original sin as consequent upon an accidental act of the first man
- EnL",160
13345,"For the very notion of spirit is enough to show that man is evil by nature, and it is an error to imagine that he could ever be otherwise
- EnL",143
13346,"To such extent as man is and acts like a creature of nature, his whole behaviour is what it ought not to be
- EnL",113
13347,"For the spirit it is a duty to be free, and to realise itself by its own act
- EnL",82
13348,"Nature is for man only the starting-point which he has to transform
- EnL",73
13349,"The theological doctrine of original sin is a profound truth; but modern enlightenment prefers to believe that man is naturally good, and that he acts right so long as he continues true to nature
- EnL",201
13350,"The hour when man leaves the path of mere natural being marks the difference between him, a self-conscious agent, and the natural world
- EnL",141
13351,"But this schism, though it forms a necessary element in the very notion of spirit, is not the final goal of man
- EnL",117
13352,"It is to this state of inward breach that the whole finite action of thought and will belongs
- EnL",99
13353,"In that finite sphere man pursues ends of his own and draws from himself the material of his conduct
- EnL",106
13354,"We seem at first to have a double evil here: but both are really the same
- EnL",79
13355,"Man in so far as he is spirit is not the creature of nature: and when he behaves as such, and follows the cravings of appetite, he wills to be so
- EnL",151
13356,"The natural wickedness of man is therefore unlike the natural life of animals
- EnL",83
13357,"A mere natural life may be more exactly defined by saying that the natural man as such is an individual: for nature in every part is in the bonds of individualism
- EnL",168
13358,"Thus when man wills to be a creature of nature, he wills in the Same degree to be an individual simply
- EnL",108
13359,"Yet against such impulsive and appetitive action, due to the individualism of nature, there also steps in the law or general principle
- EnL",140
13360,"This law may either be an external force, or have the form of divine authority
- EnL",84
13361,"So long as he continues in his natural state, man is in bondage to the law--It is true that among the instincts and affections of man, there are social or benevolent inclinations, love, sympathy, and others, reaching beyond his selfish isolation
- EnL",251
13362,"But so long as these tendencies are instinctive, their virtual universality of scope and purport is vitiated by the subjective form which always allows free play to self-seeking and random action
- EnL",201
13363,"The term 'Objective Thoughts' indicates the truth--the truth which is to be the absolute object of philosophy, and not merely the goal at which it aims
- EnL",157
13364,"But the very expression cannot fail to suggest an opposition, to characterise and appreciate which is the main motive of the philosophical attitude of the present time, and which forms the real problem of the question about truth and our means of ascertaining it
- EnL",268
13365,"If the thought-forms are vitiated by a fixed antithesis, i e if they are only of a finite character, they are unsuitable for the self-centred universe of truth, and truth can find no adequate receptacle in thought
- EnL",219
13366,"Such thought, which--- can produce only limited and partial categories and I proceed by their means; is what in the stricter sense of the word is termed Understanding
- EnL",172
13367,"The finitude, further, of these categories lies in two points
- EnL",67
13368,"Firstly, they are only subjective, and the antithesis of an objective permanently clings to them
- EnL",102
13369,"Secondly, they are always of restricted content, and so persist in antithesis to one another and still more to the Absolute
- EnL",129
13370,"In order more fully to explain the position and import here attributed to logic, the attitudes in which thought is supposed to stand to objectivity will next be examined by way of further introduction
- EnL",206
13372,"But in these circumstances it was impossible to restrict the quest to the mere form of consciousness
- EnL",106
13374,"In the development of consciousness, which at first sight appears limited to the point of form merely, there is thus at the same time included the development of the matter or of the objects discussed in the special branches of philosophy
- EnL",244
13375,"But the latter process must, so to speak, go on behind consciousness, since those facts are the essential nucleus which is raised into consciousness
- EnL",154
13376,"The exposition accordingly is rendered more intricate, because so much that properly belongs to the concrete branches is prematurely dragged into the introduction
- EnL",168
13377,"The survey which follows in the present work has even more the inconvenience of being only historical and inferential in its method
- EnL",137
13379,"The first of these attitudes of thought is seen in the method which has no doubts and no sense of the contradiction in thought, or of the hostility of thought against itself
- EnL",179
13380,"It entertains an unquestioning belief that reflection is the means of ascertaining the truth, and of bringing the objects before the mind as they really are
- EnL",162
13381,"And in this belief it advances straight upon its objects, takes the materials furnished by sense and perception, and reproduces them from itself as facts of thought; and then, believing this result to be the truth, the method is content
- EnL",242
13382,"Philosophy in its earliest stages, all the sciences, and even the daily action and movement of consciousness, live in this faith
- EnL",134
13384,"In the present introduction the main question for us is to observe this attitude of thought in its extreme form; and we shall accordingly first of all examine its second and inferior aspect as a philosophic system
- EnL",219
13385,"One of the clearest instances of it, and one lying nearest to ourselves, may be found in the Metaphysic of the Past as it subsisted among us previous to the philosophy of Kant
- EnL",181
13386,"It is however only in reference to the history of philosophy that this Metaphysic can be said to belong to the past: the thing is always and at all places to be found, as the view which the abstract understanding takes of the objects of reason
- EnL",249
13387,"And it is in this point that the real and immediate good lies of a closer examination of its main scope and its modus operandi
- EnL",132
13388,"This metaphysical system took the laws and forms of thought to be the fundamental laws and forms of things
- EnL",112
13389,"It assumed that to think a thing was the means of finding its very self and nature: and to that extent it occupied higher ground than the Critical
- EnL",152
13390,"Philosophy which succeeded it
- EnL",35
13391,"But in the first instance (i) these terms of thought were cut off from their connexion, their solidarity; each was believed valid by itself and capable of serving as a predicate of the truth
- EnL",196
13392,"It was the general assumption of this metaphysic that a knowledge of the Absolute was gained by assigning predicates to it
- EnL",128
13393,"It neither inquired what the terms of the understanding specially meant or what they were worth, nor did it test the method which characterises the Absolute by the assignment of predicates
- EnL",194
13394,"As an example of such predicates may be taken; Existence, in the proposition, 'God has existence:' Finitude or Infinity, as in the question, 'Is the world-finite or infinite?
- EnL",180
13395,"The Metaphysic of the past assumed, as unsophisticated belief always does that thought apprehends the very self of things, and that things, to become what they truly are, require to be thought
- EnL",198
13397,"In the first place it never went beyond the province of the analytic understanding
- EnL",88
13398,"But in using the term thought we must not forget the difference between finite or discursive thinking and the thinking which is infinite and rational
- EnL",155
13399,"The categories, as they meet us prima facie and in isolation, are finite forms
- EnL",84
13400,"But truth is always infinite, and cannot be expressed or presented to consciousness in finite terms
- EnL",105
13401,"The phrase infinite thought may excite surprise, if we adhere to the modern conception that thought is always limited
- EnL",123
13402,"But it is, speaking rightly, the very essence of thought to be infinite
- EnL",77
13403,"The nominal explanation of calling a thing finite is that it has an end, that it exists up to a certain point only, where it comes into contact with, and is limited by, its other
- EnL",184
13404,"The finite therefore subsists in reference to its other, which is its negation and presents itself as its limit
- EnL",117
13405,"Now thought is always in its own sphere; its relations are with itself, and it is its own object
- EnL",102
13406,"In having a thought for object, I am at home with myself
- EnL",62
13407,"The thinking power, the 'I,' is therefore infinite, because, when it thinks, it is in relation to an object which is itself
- EnL",129
13408,"Generally speaking, an object means a something else, a negative confronting me
- EnL",85
13409,"But in the case where thought thinks itself, it has an object which is at the same time no object: in other words, its objectivity is suppressed and transformed into an idea
- EnL",179
13410,"Thought, as thought, therefore in its unmixed nature involves no limits; it is finite only when it keeps to limited categories, which it believes to be ultimate
- EnL",166
13411,"Infinite or speculative thought, on the contrary, while it no less defines, does in the very act of limiting and defining make that defect vanish
- EnL",151
13412,"And so infinity is not, as most frequently happens, to be conceived as an abstract away and away for ever and ever, but in the simple manner previously indicated
- EnL",167
13413,"The thinking of the old metaphysical system was finite
- EnL",60
13414,"Its whole mode of action was regulated by categories, the limits of which it believed to be permanently fixed and not subject to any further negation
- EnL",155
13415,"Thus, one of its questions was: Has God existence?
- EnL",56
13416,"The question supposes that existence is an altogether positive term, a sort of ne plus ultra
- EnL",98
13417,"We shall see however at a later point that existence is by no means a merely positive term, but one which is toe low for the Absolute Idea, and unworthy of God
- EnL",165
13418,"A second question in these metaphysical systems was: Is the world finite or infinite?
- EnL",91
13420,"But a restricted infinity is itself only a finite
- EnL",55
13421,"In the same way it was asked whether the soul was simple or composite
- EnL",75
13422,"Simpleness was, in other words, taken to be an ultimate characteristic, giving expression to a whole truth
- EnL",112
13423,"Far from being so, simpleness is the expression of a half-truth, as one-sided and abstract as existence:--a term of thought, which, as we shall hereafter see, is itself untrue and hence unable to hold truth
- EnL",212
13424,"If the soul be viewed as merely and abstractly simple, it is characterised in an inadequate and finite way
- EnL",112
13425,"It was therefore the main question of the pre-Kantian metaphysic to discover whether predicates of the kind mentioned were to be ascribed to its objects
- EnL",158
13426,"Now these predicates are after all only limited formulae of the understanding which, instead of expressing the truth, merely impose a limit
- EnL",145
13427,"More than this, it should be noted that the chief feature of the method lay in 'assigning' or 'attributing' predicates to the object that was to be cognised, for example, to God
- EnL",183
13428,"But attribution is no more than an external reflection about the object: the predicates by which the object is to be determined are supplied from the resources of picture-thought, and are applied in a mechanical way
- EnL",221
13429,"Whereas, if we are to have genuine cognition, the object must characterise its own self and not derive its predicates from without
- EnL",136
13430,"Even supposing we follow the method of predicating, the mind cannot help feeling that predicates of this sort fail to exhaust the object
- EnL",142
13431,"From the same point of view the Orientals are quite correct in calling God the many-named or the myriad-named One
- EnL",119
13432,"One after another of these finite categories leaves the soul unsatisfied, and the Oriental sage is compelled unceasingly to seek for more and more of such predicates
- EnL",171
13433,"In finite things it is no doubt the case that they have to be characterised through finite predicates: and with these things the understanding finds proper scope for its special action
- EnL",190
13434,"Itself finite, it knows only the nature of the finite
- EnL",59
13435,"Thus, when I call some action a theft, I have characterised the action in its essential facts: and such a knowledge is sufficient for the judge
- EnL",149
13436,"Similarly, finite things stand to each other as cause and effect, force and exercise, and when they are apprehended in these categories, they are known in their finitude
- EnL",175
13437,"But the objects of reason cannot be defined by these finite predicates
- EnL",76
13438,"To try to do so was the defect of the old metaphysic
- EnL",58
13440,"Besides, though the fact of their being all predicates of one subject supplies them with a certain connexion, their several meanings keep them apart: and consequently each is brought in as a stranger in relation to the others
- EnL",231
13441,"The first of these defects the Orientals sought to remedy, when, for example, they defined God by attributing to Him many names; but still they felt that the number of names would have had to be infinite
- EnL",209
13442,"Their objects were no doubt totalities which in their own proper selves belong to reason,--that is, to the organised and systematically-developed universe, of thought
- EnL",172
13443,"They were assumed from popular conception
- EnL",47
13444,"Accordingly popular conception was the only canon for settling whether or not the predicates were suitable and sufficient
- EnL",127
13445,"The common conceptions of God, the Soul, the World, may be supposed to afford thought a firm and fast footing
- EnL",115
13446,"They do not really do so
- EnL",30
13447,"Besides having, a particular and subjective character clinging to them, and thus leaving room for great variety of interpretation, they themselves first of all require a firm and fast definition by thought
- EnL",211
13448,"This may be seen in any of these propositions where the predicate, or in philosophy the category, is needed to indicate what the subject, or the conception we start with, is
- EnL",179
13449,"In such a sentence as 'God is eternal,' we begin with the conception of God, not knowing as yet what he is: to tell us that, is the business of the predicate
- EnL",163
13451,"Besides, the propositional form (and for proposition, it would be more correct to substitute judgment) is not suited to express the concrete--and the true is always concrete--or the speculative
- EnL",199
13452,"Every judgment is by its form one-sided and, to that extent, false
- EnL",72
13453,"This metaphysic was not free or objective thinking
- EnL",56
13454,"Instead of letting the object freely and spontaneously expound its own characteristics, metaphysic pre-supposed it ready-made
- EnL",131
13455,"If any one wishes to know what free thought means, he must go to Greek philosophy: for Scholasticism, like these metaphysical systems, accepted its facts, and accepted them as a dogma from the authority of the Church
- EnL",222
13456,"We moderns, too, by our whole up-bringing, have been initiated into ideas which it is extremely difficult to overstep, on account of their far-reaching significance
- EnL",170
13457,"But the ancient philosophers were in a different position
- EnL",63
13458,"They were men who lived wholly in the perceptions of the senses, and who, after their rejection of mythology and its fancies, pre-supposed nothing but the heaven above and the earth around
- EnL",194
13459,"In these material, non-metaphysical surroundings, thought is free and enjoys its own privacy,--cleared of everything material, and thoroughly at home
- EnL",155
13460,"This feeling that we are all our own is characteristic of free thought--of that voyage into the open, where nothing is below us or above us, and we stand in solitude with ourselves alone
- EnL",192
13461,"When our thought never ranges beyond narrow and rigid terms, we are forced to assume that of two opposite assertions, such as were the above propositions, the one must be true and the other false
- EnL",201
13462,"Dogmatism may be most simply described as the contrary of Scepticism
- EnL",74
13463,"The ancient Sceptics gave the name of Dogmatism to every philosophy whatever holding a system of definite doctrine
- EnL",120
13464,"In this large sense Scepticism may apply the name even to philosophy which is properly Speculative
- EnL",104
13465,"But in the narrower sense, Dogmatism consists in the tenacity which draws a hard and fast line between certain terms and others opposite to them
- EnL",150
13466,"We may see this clearly in the strict 'Either--or': for instance, The world is either finite or infinite; but one of these two it must be
- EnL",143
13467,"The contrary of this rigidity is the characteristic of all Speculative truth
- EnL",82
13468,"There no such inadequate formulae are allowed, nor can they possibly exhaust it
- EnL",85
13469,"These formulae Speculative truth holds in union as a totality, whereas, Dogmatism invests them in their isolation with a title to fixity and truth
- EnL",152
13470,"It often happens in philosophy that the half-truth takes its place beside the whole truth and assumes on its own account the position of something permanent
- EnL",162
13471,"But the fact is that the half-truth, instead of being a fixed or self-subsistent principle, is a mere element absolved and included in the whole
- EnL",150
13472,"The metaphysic of understanding is dogmatic, because it maintains half-truths in their isolation: whereas the idealism of speculative philosophy carries out the principle of totality and shows that it can reach beyond the inadequate formularies of abstract thought
- EnL",270
13473,"Thus idealism would say:--The soul is neither finite only, nor infinite only; it is really the one just as much as the other, and in that way neither the one nor the other
- EnL",177
13474,"In other words; such formularies in their isolation are inadmissible, and only come into account as formative elements in a larger notion
- EnL",143
13475,"Such idealism we see even in the ordinary phases of consciousness
- EnL",71
13476,"Thus we say of sensible things, that they are changeable: that is, they are, but it is equally true that they are not
- EnL",123
13477,"We show more obstinacy in dealing with the categories of the understanding
- EnL",80
13478,"These are terms which we believe to be somewhat firmer--or even absolutely firm and fast
- EnL",94
13479,"The battle of reason is the struggle to break up the rigidity to which the understanding has reduced everything
- EnL",117
13480,"The first part of this metaphysic in its systematic form is Ontology, or the doctrine of the abstract characteristics of Being
- EnL",132
13481,"The multitude of these characteristics, and the limits set to their applicability, are not founded upon any principle
- EnL",123
13482,"They have in consequence to be enumerated as experience and circumstances direct, and the import ascribed to them is founded only upon common sensualised conceptions, upon assertions that particular words are used in a particular sense, and even perhaps upon etymology
- EnL",274
13485,"Now as the notion is concrete, it and every character of it in general is essentially a self-contained unity of distinct characteristics
- EnL",142
13486,"If truth then were nothing more than the absence of contradiction, it would be first of all necessary in the case of every-notion to examine whether it, taken individually, did not contain this sort of intrinsic contradiction
- EnL",231
13487,"The second branch of the metaphysical system was Rational Psychology or Pneumatology
- EnL",90
13488,"It dealt with the metaphysical nature of the Soul,--that is, of the Mind regarded as a thing
- EnL",98
13489,"It expected to find immortality in a sphere dominated by the laws of composition, time, qualitative change, and quantitative increase or decrease
- EnL",151
13490,"The name 'rational,' given to this species of psychology, served to contrast it with empirical modes of observing the phenomena of the soul
- EnL",145
13491,"Rational psychology viewed the soul in its metaphysical nature, and through the categories supplied by abstract thought
- EnL",125
13492,"The rationalists endeavoured to ascertain the inner nature of the soul as it is in itself and as it is for thought--In philosophy at present we hear little of the soul: the favourite term now is mind (spirit)
- EnL",214
13493,"The two are distinct, soul being as it were the middle term between body and spirit, or the bond between the two
- EnL",118
13494,"The mind, as soul, is immersed in corporeity, and the soul is the animating principle of the body
- EnL",103
13495,"The pre-Kantian metaphysic, we say, viewed the soul as a thing
- EnL",68
13496,"By a thing, we mean, firstly, an immediate existence, something we represent in sensuous form: and in this meaning the term has been applied to the soul
- EnL",158
13497,"Hence the question regarding the seat of the soul
- EnL",55
13498,"Of course, if the soul have a seat, it is in space and sensuously envisaged
- EnL",81
13499,"So, too, if the soul be viewed as a thing, we can ask whether the soul is simple or composite
- EnL",99
13500,"The question is important as bearing on the immortality of the soul, which is supposed to depend on the absence of composition
- EnL",132
13501,"But the fact is, that in abstract simplicity we have a category, which as little corresponds to the nature of the soul, as that of compositeness
- EnL",150
13502,"One word on the relation of rational to empirical psychology
- EnL",66
13503,"The former, because it sets itself to apply thought to cognise mind and even to demonstrate the result of such thinking, is the higher; whereas empirical psychology starts from perception, and only recounts and describes what perception supplies
- EnL",251
13504,"But if we propose to think the mind, we must not be quite so shy of its special phenomena
- EnL",95
13505,"Mind is essentially active in the same sense as the Schoolmen said that God is 'absolute actuosity'
- EnL",105
13506,"But if the mind is active it must as it were utter itself
- EnL",63
13507,"It is wrong therefore to take the mind for a processless ens, as did the old metaphysic which divided the processless inward life of the mind from its outward life
- EnL",169
13508,"The mind, of all things, must be looked at in its concrete actuality, in its energy; and in such a way that its manifestations are seen to be determined by its inward force
- EnL",178
13509,"The third branch of metaphysics was Cosmology
- EnL",51
13510,"The topics it embraced were the world, its contingency, necessity, eternity, limitation in time and space: the laws (only formal) of its changes: the freedom of man and the origin of evil
- EnL",193
13512,"The object of Cosmology comprised not merely Nature, but Mind too, in its external complication in its phenomenon--in fact, existence in general, or the sum of finite things
- EnL",179
13513,"This object however it viewed not as a concrete whole, but only under certain abstract points of view
- EnL",107
13514,"Thus the questions Cosmology attempted to solve were such as these: Is accident or necessity dominant in the world?
- EnL",121
13515,"Is the world eternal or created?
- EnL",38
13516,"It was therefore a chief concern of this study to lay down what were called general Cosmological laws: for instance, that Nature does not act by fits and starts
- EnL",166
13517,"And by fits and starts (saltus) they meant a qualitative difference or qualitative alteration showing itself without any antecedent determining mean: whereas, on the contrary, a gradual change (of quantity) is obviously not without intermediation
- EnL",252
13518,"In regard to Mind as it makes itself felt in the world, the questions which Cosmology chiefly discussed turned upon the freedom of man and the origin of evil
- EnL",163
13519,"Nobody can deny that these are questions of the highest importance
- EnL",72
13521,"This however is the general position taken by the metaphysicians before Kant, and appears in their cosmological discussions, which for that reason were incapable of compassing their purpose, to understand the phenomena of the world
- EnL",237
13522,"Observe how they proceed with the distinction between freedom and necessity, in their application of these categories to Nature and Mind
- EnL",142
13523,"Nature they regard as subject in its workings to necessity; Mind they hold to be free
- EnL",91
13524,"No doubt there is a real foundation for this distinction in the very core of the Mind itself: but freedom and necessity, when thus abstractly opposed, are terms applicable only in the finite world to which, as such, they belong
- EnL",233
13525,"A freedom involving no necessity, and mere necessity without freedom, are abstract and in this way untrue formulae of thought
- EnL",131
13526,"Freedom is no blank indeterminateness: essentially concrete, and unvaryingly self-determinate, it is so far at the same time necessary
- EnL",140
13528,"The case is similar with the contrast of Good and Evil,--the favourite contrast of the introspective modern world
- EnL",119
13530,"The error arises when we take Evil as a permanent positive, instead of--what it really is--a negative which, though it would fain assert itself, has no real persistence, and is, in fact, only the absolute sham-existence of negativity in itself
- EnL",249
13531,"The fourth branch of metaphysics is Natural or Rational Theology
- EnL",70
13532,"The notion of God, or God as a possible being, the proofs of his existence, and his properties, formed the study of this branch
- EnL",133
13534,"For it requires the statement of some objective ground for God's being, which thus acquires the appearance of being derived from something else
- EnL",149
13535,"This mode of proof, guided as it is by the canon of mere analytical identity, is embarrassed by the difficulty of passing from the finite to the infinite
- EnL",159
13537,"Yet in our material thought, the finite world continues, meanwhile, to have a real being, with God as a sort of antithesis: and thus arises the further picture of different relations of God to the world
- EnL",208
13538,"These, formulated as properties, must, on the one hand, as relations to finite circumstances, themselves possess a finite character (giving us such properties as just, gracious, mighty, wise, &c); on the other hand they must be infinite
- EnL",242
13539,"Now on this level of thought the only means, and a hazy one, of reconciling these opposing requirements was quantitative exaltation of the properties, forcing them into indeterminateness,--into the sensus eminentior
- EnL",221
13540,"But it was an expedient which really destroyed the property and left a mere name
- EnL",86
13541,"The object of the old metaphysical theology was to see how far unassisted reason could go in the knowledge of God
- EnL",119
13542,"Certainly a reason-derived knowledge of God is the highest problem of philosophy
- EnL",86
13543,"The earliest teachings of religion are figurate conceptions of God
- EnL",72
13544,"These conceptions, as the Creed arranges them, are imparted to us in youth
- EnL",80
13545,"They are the doctrines of our religion, and in so far as the individual rests his faith on these doctrines and feels them to be the truth, he has all he needs as a Christian
- EnL",179
13546,"Such is faith: and the science of this faith is Theology
- EnL",62
13547,"But until Theology is something more than a bare enumeration and compilation of these doctrines ab extra, it has no right to the title of science
- EnL",151
13548,"Even the method so much in vogue at present--the purely historical mode of treatment--which for example reports what has been said by this or the other Father of the Church--does not invest theology with a scientific character
- EnL",232
13549,"To get that, we must go on to comprehend the facts by thought,--which is the business of philosophy
- EnL",105
13550,"Genuine theology is thus at the same time a real philosophy of religion, as it was, we may add, in the Middle Ages
- EnL",120
13551,"And now let us examine this rational theology more narrowly
- EnL",65
13552,"It was a science which approached God not by reason but by understanding, and, in its mode of thought, employed the terms without any sense of their mutual limitations and connexions
- EnL",188
13553,"The notion of God formed the subject of discussion; and yet the criterion of our knowledge was derived from such an extraneous source as the materialised conception of God
- EnL",177
13554,"Now thought must be free in its movements
- EnL",47
13555,"It is no doubt to be remembered, that the result of independent thought harmonises with the import of the Christian religion:--for the Christian religion is a revelation of reason
- EnL",185
13556,"But such a harmony surpassed the efforts of rational theology
- EnL",67
13557,"It proposed to define the figurate conception of God in terms of thought; but it resulted in a notion of God which was what we may call the abstract of positivity or reality, to the exclusion of all negation
- EnL",213
13558,"God was accordingly defined to be the most real of all beings
- EnL",67
13559,"Any one can see however that this most real of beings, in which negation forms no part, is the very opposite of what it ought to be and of what understanding supposes it to be
- EnL",181
13560,"Instead of being rich and full above all measure, it is so narrowly conceived that it is, on the contrary, extremely poor and altogether empty
- EnL",148
13561,"It is with reason that the heart craves a concrete body of truth; but without definite feature, that is, without negation, contained in the notion, there can only be an abstraction
- EnL",186
13562,"Mere light is mere darkness
- EnL",33
13563,"The second problem of rational theology was to prove the existence of God
- EnL",79
13564,"Now, in this matter, the main point to be noted is that demonstration, as the understanding employs it, means the dependence of one truth on another
- EnL",154
13565,"In such proofs we have a pre-supposition--something firm and fast, from which something else follows; we exhibit the dependence of some truth from an assumed starting-point
- EnL",178
13566,"Hence, if this mode of demonstration is applied to the existence of God, it can only mean that the being of God is to depend on other terms, which will then constitute the ground of his being
- EnL",197
13567,"It is at once evident that this will lead I to some mistake: for God must be simply and solely the I ground of everything, and in so far not dependent upon anything else
- EnL",175
13568,"And a perception of this danger has in modern times led some to say that God's existence is not capable of proof, but must be immediately or intuitively apprehended
- EnL",170
13569,"Reason, however, and even sound common sense give demonstration a meaning quite different from that of the understanding
- EnL",126
13570,"The demonstration of reason no doubt starts from something which is not God
- EnL",81
13571,"But, as it advances, it does not leave the starting-point a mere unexplained fact, which is what it was
- EnL",109
13572,"On the contrary it exhibits that point as derivative and called into being, and then God is seen to be primary, truly immediate and self-subsisting, with the means of derivation wrapt up and absorbed in himself
- EnL",216
13574,"The relation of the two things is reversed; and what came as a consequence, being shown to be an antecedent, the original antecedent is reduced to a consequence
- EnL",166
13575,"This is always the way, moreover, whenever reason demonstrates
- EnL",68
13577,"But this infinite of the understanding, this pure essence, is still finite: it has excluded all the variety of particular things, which thus limit and deny it
- EnL",164
13578,"Instead of winning a concrete, this metaphysic stuck fast on an abstract, identity
- EnL",88
13579,"Its good point was the perception that thought alone constitutes the essence of all that is
- EnL",97
13580,"It derived its materials from earlier philosophers, particularly the Schoolmen
- EnL",84
13581,"In speculative philosophy the understanding undoubtedly forms a stage, but not a stage at which we should keep for ever standing
- EnL",134
13582,"Plato is no metaphysician of this imperfect type, still less Aristotle, although the contrary is generally believed
- EnL",121
13583,"Under these circumstances a double want began to be felt
- EnL",62
13584,"Partly it was the need of a concrete subject-matter, as a counterpoise to the abstract theories of the understanding, which is unable to advance unaided from its generalities to specialisation and determination
- EnL",216
13585,"Partly, too, it was the demand for something fixed and secure, so as to exclude the possibility of proving anything and everything in the sphere, and according to the method, of the finite formulae of thought
- EnL",214
13586,"Such was the genesis of Empirical philosophy, which abandons the search for truth in thought itself, and goes to fetch it from Experience, the outward and the inward present
- EnL",179
13587,"The rise of Empiricism is due to the need thus stated of concrete contents, and a firm footing--needs which the abstract metaphysic of the understanding failed to satisfy
- EnL",176
13588,"Now by concreteness of contents it is meant that we must know the objects of consciousness as intrinsically determinate and as the unity of distinct characteristics
- EnL",170
13589,"But, as we have already seen, this is by no means the case with the metaphysic of understanding, if it conform to its principle
- EnL",133
13590,"Thus we find the metaphysicians engaged in an attempt to elicit by the instrumentality of thought, what was the essence or fundamental attribute of the Soul The Soul, they said, is simple
- EnL",193
13591,"The simplicity thus ascribed to the Soul meant a mere and utter simplicity, from which difference is excluded: difference, or in other words composition, being made the fundamental attribute of body, or of matter in general
- EnL",229
13592,"Clearly, in simplicity of this narrow type we have a very shallow category, quite incapable of embracing the wealth of the soul or of the mind
- EnL",148
13593,"The same happened in the case of Rational Physics
- EnL",55
13594,"The current phrases there were, for instance, that space is infinite, that Nature makes no leap, &c Evidently this phraseology was wholly unsatisfactory in presence of the plenitude and life of nature
- EnL",206
13595,"To some extent this source from which Empiricism draws is common to it with metaphysic
- EnL",92
13596,"It is in our materialised conceptions, ie in facts which emanate, in the first instance, from experience, that metaphysic also finds the guarantee for the correctness of its definitions (including both its initial assumptions and its more detailed body of doctrine)
- EnL",271
13597,"But, on the other hand, it must be noted that the single sensation is not the same thing as experience, and that the Empirical School elevates the facts included under sensation, feeling, and perception into the form of general ideas, propositions or laws
- EnL",261
13599,"And on the subjective side Empirical cognition has its stable footing in the fact that in a sensation consciousness is directly present and certain of itself
- EnL",163
13600,"In Empiricism lies the great principle that whatever is true must be in the actual world and present to sensation
- EnL",119
13601,"This principle contradicts that 'ought to be' on the strength of which 'reflection' is vain enough to treat the actual present with scorn and to point to a scene beyond--a scene which is assumed to have place and being only in the understanding of those who talk of it
- EnL",274
13602,"No less than Empiricism, philosophy (§ 7) recognises only what is, and has nothing to do with what merely ought to be and what is thus confessed not to exist
- EnL",163
13603,"On the subjective side, too, it is right to notice the valuable principle of freedom involved in Empiricism
- EnL",113
13604,"For the main lesson of Empiricism is that man must see for himself and feel that he is present in every fact of knowledge which he has to accept
- EnL",150
13605,"But there is a fundamental delusion in all scientific empiricism
- EnL",70
13606,"It employs the metaphysical categories of matter, force, those of one, many, generality, infinity, &c; following the clue given by these categories it proceeds to draw conclusions, and in so doing pre-supposes and applies the syllogistic form
- EnL",248
13607,"And all the while it is unaware that it contains metaphysics--in wielding which, it makes use of those categories and their combinations in a style utterly thoughtless and uncritical
- EnL",188
13608,"Nobody can deny that there is a good deal of truth in these words
- EnL",71
13609,"The every-day world, what is here and now, was a good exchange for the futile other-world--for the mirages and the chimeras of the abstract understanding
- EnL",159
13610,"And thus was acquired an infinite principle,--that solid footing so much missed in the old metaphysic
- EnL",107
13611,"Finite principles are the most that the understanding can pick out--and these being essentially unstable and tottering, the structure they supported must collapse with a crash
- EnL",181
13612,"Always the instinct of reason was to find an infinite principle
- EnL",69
13613,"As yet, the time had not come for finding it in thought
- EnL",61
13614,"Hence, this instinct seized upon the present, the Here, the This,--where doubtless there is implicit infinite form, but not in the genuine existence of that form
- EnL",167
13615,"The external world is the truth, if it could but know it: for the truth is actual and must exist
- EnL",102
13616,"The infinite principle, the self-centred truth, therefore, is in the world for reason to discover: though it exists in an individual and sensible shape, and not in its truth
- EnL",179
13617,"Besides, this school makes sense-perception the form in which fact is to be apprehended: and in this consists the defect of Empiricism
- EnL",140
13618,"Sense-perception as such is always individual, always transient: not indeed that the process of knowledge stops short at sensation: on the contrary, it proceeds to find out the universal and permanent element in the individual apprehended by sense
- EnL",253
13619,"This is the process leading from simple perception to experience
- EnL",70
13620,"In order to form experiences, Empiricism makes especial use of the form of Analysis
- EnL",89
13621,"In the impression of sense we have a concrete of many elements, the several attributes of which we are expected to peel off one by one, like the coats of an onion
- EnL",168
13622,"In thus dismembering the thing, it is understood that we disintegrate and take to pieces these attributes which have coalesced, and add nothing but our own act of disintegration
- EnL",183
13623,"Yet analysis is the process from the immediacy of sensation to thought: those attributes, which the object analysed contains in union, acquire the form of universality by being separated
- EnL",192
13624,"Empiricism therefore labours under a delusion, if it supposes that, while analysing the objects, it leaves them as they were: it really transforms the concrete into an abstract
- EnL",182
13625,"And as a consequence of this change the living thing is killed: life can exist only in the concrete and one
- EnL",113
13626,"Not that we can do without this division, if it be our intention to comprehend
- EnL",84
13627,"Mind itself is an inherent division
- EnL",41
13628,"The error lies in forgetting that this is only one-half of the process, and that the main point is the re-union of what has been parted
- EnL",141
13629,"And it is where analysis never gets beyond the stage of partition that the words of the poet are true:      'Encheiresin Naturae nennt's die Chemie,     Spottet ihrer Selbst, und weiss nicht, wie:     Hat die Teile in Ihrer Hand     Fehlt leider nur das geistige Band'
- EnL",274
13630,"Analysis starts from the concrete; and the possession of this material gives it a considerable advantage over the abstract thinking of the old metaphysics
- EnL",160
13631,"It establishes the differences in things: and this is very important: but these very differences are nothing after all but abstract attributes, eg thoughts
- EnL",161
13632,"These thoughts, it is assumed, contain the real essence of the objects; and thus once more we see the axiom of bygone metaphysics reappear, that the truth of things lies in thought
- EnL",186
13633,"Let us next compare the empirical theory with that of metaphysics in the matter of their respective contents
- EnL",114
13635,"They are the sensible facts of nature and the facts of the finite mind
- EnL",76
13636,"In other words, Empiricism deals with a finite material--and the old metaphysicians had an infinite,--though, let us add, they made this infinite content finite by the finite form of the understanding
- EnL",206
13637,"The same finitude of form reappears in Empiricism--but here the facts are finite also
- EnL",91
13638,"To this exigent, then, both modes of philosophising have the same method; both proceed from data or assumptions, which they accept as ultimate
- EnL",148
13639,"Generally speaking, Empiricism finds the truth in the outward world; and even if it allow a super-sensible world, it holds knowledge of that world to be impossible, and would restrict us to the province of sense-perception
- EnL",228
13640,"This doctrine when systematically carried out produces what has been latterly termed Materialism
- EnL",102
13641,"Materialism of this stamp looks upon matter, quâ matter, as the genuine objective world
- EnL",93
13642,"But with matter we are at once introduced to an abstraction, which as such cannot be perceived: and it may be maintained that there is no matter, because, as it exists, it is always something definite and concrete
- EnL",219
13643,"Yet the abstraction we term matter is supposed to lie at the basis of the whole world of sense, and expresses the sense-world in its simplest terms as out-and-out individualisation, and hence a congeries of points in mutual exclusion
- EnL",239
13644,"So long then as this sensible sphere is and continues to be for Empiricism a mere datum, we have a doctrine of bondage: for we become free, when we are confronted by no absolutely alien world, but depend upon a fact which we ourselves are
- EnL",244
13645,"Consistently with the empirical point of view, besides, reason and unreason can only be subjective: in other words, we must take what is given just as it is, and we have no right to ask whether and to what extent it is rational in its own nature
- EnL",251
13646,"Touching this principle it has been justly observed that in what we call Experience, as distinct from mere single perception of single facts, there are two elements
- EnL",170
13647,"The one is the matter, infinite in its multiplicity, and as it stands a mere set of singulars: the other is the form, the characteristics of universality and necessity
- EnL",173
13648,"Mere experience no doubt offers many, perhaps innumerable cases of similar perceptions: but, after all, no multitude, however great, can be the same thing as universality
- EnL",176
13649,"Similarly, mere experience affords perceptions of changes succeeding each other and of objects in juxtaposition; but it presents no necessary connexion
- EnL",157
13650,"If perception, therefore, is to maintain its claim to be the sole basis of what men hold for truth, universality and necessity appear something illegitimate: they become an accident of our minds, a mere custom, the content of which might be otherwise constituted than it is
- EnL",279
13651,"It is an important corollary of this theory, that on this empirical mode of treatment legal and ethical principles and laws, as well as the truths of religion, are exhibited as the work of chance, and stripped of their objective character and inner truth
- EnL",260
13652,"The scepticism of Hume, to which this conclusion was chiefly due, should be clearly marked off from Greek scepticism
- EnL",122
13653,"Hume assumes the truth of the empirical element, feeling and sensation, and proceeds to challenge universal principles and laws, because they have no warranty from sense-perception
- EnL",186
13654,"So far was ancient scepticism from making feeling and sensation the canon of truth, that it turned against the deliverances of sense first of all
- EnL",151
13655,"In common with Empiricism the Critical Philosophy assumes that experience affords the one sole foundation for cognitions; which however it does not allow to rank as truths, but only as knowledge of phenomena
- EnL",213
13656,"The Critical theory starts originally from the distinction of elements presented in the analysis of experience, viz the matter of sense, and its universal relations
- EnL",170
13658,"This element, not being derived from the empirical facts as such, must belong to the spontaneity of thought; in other words, it is a priori
- EnL",145
13659,"The Categories or Notions of the Understanding constitute the objectivity of experiential cognitions
- EnL",106
13660,"In every case they involve a connective reference, and hence through their means are formed synthetic judgments a priori, that is, primary and underivative connexions of opposites
- EnL",185
13661,"Even Hume's scepticism does not deny that the characteristics of universality and necessity are found in cognition
- EnL",120
13662,"And even in Kant this fact remains a presupposition after all; it may be said, to use the ordinary phraseology of the sciences, that Kant did no more than offer another explanation of the fact
- EnL",198
13663,"The Critical Philosophy proceeds to test the value of the categories employed in metaphysic, as well as in other sciences and in ordinary conception
- EnL",154
13664,"This scrutiny however is not directed to the content of these categories, nor does it inquire into the exact relation they bear to one another: but simply considers them as affected by the contrast between subjective and objective
- EnL",236
13665,"The contrast, as we are to understand it here, bears upon the distinction (see preceding §) of the two elements in experience
- EnL",131
13666,"The name of objectivity is here given to the element of universality and necessity, ie to the categories themselves, or what is called the a priori constituent
- EnL",165
13667,"The Critical Philosophy however widened the contrast in such away, that the subjectivity comes to embrace the ensemble of experience, including both of the aforesaid elements; and nothing remains on the other side but the 'thing-in-itself'
- EnL",245
13669,"The plain thinker pursued his unsuspecting way in those categories which had offered themselves naturally
- EnL",111
13670,"It never occurred to him to ask to what extent these categories had a value and authority of their own
- EnL",108
13671,"If, as has been said, it is characteristic of free thought to allow no assumptions to pass unquestioned, the old metaphysicians were not free thinkers
- EnL",156
13672,"They accepted their categories as they were, without further trouble, as an a priori datum, not yet tested by reflection
- EnL",126
13673,"The Critical philosophy reversed this
- EnL",43
13674,"Kant undertook to examine how far the forms of thought were capable of leading to the knowledge of truth
- EnL",110
13675,"In particular he demanded a criticism of the faculty of cognition as preliminary to its exercise
- EnL",102
13676,"That is a fair demand, if it mean that even the forms of thought must be made an object of investigation
- EnL",110
13677,"Unfortunately there soon creeps in the misconception of already knowing before you know,--the error of refusing to enter the water until you have learnt to swim
- EnL",166
13678,"True, indeed, the forms of thought should be subjected to a scrutiny before they are used: yet what is this scrutiny but ipso facto a cognition?
- EnL",150
13679,"So that what we want is to combine in our process of inquiry the action of the forms of thought with a criticism of them
- EnL",126
13680,"The forms of thought must be studied in their essential nature and complete development: they are at once the object of research and the action of that object
- EnL",164
13681,"Hence they examine themselves: in their own action they must determine their limits, and point out their defects
- EnL",118
13682,"This is that action of thought, which will hereafter be specially considered under the name of Dialectic, and regarding which we need only at the outset observe that, instead of being brought to bear upon the categories from without, it is immanent in their own action
- EnL",274
13683,"People in the present day have got over Kant and his philosophy: everybody wants to get further
- EnL",101
13684,"But there are two ways of going further--a back-, ward and a forward
- EnL",74
13685,"The light of criticism soon shows that many of our modern essays in philosophy are mere repetitions of the old metaphysical method, an endless and uncritical thinking in a groove determined by the natural bent of each man's mind
- EnL",234
13686,"In the language of common life we mean by objective what exists outside of us and reaches us from without by means of sensation
- EnL",133
13687,"What Kant did, was to deny that the categories, such as cause and effect, were, in this sense of the word, objective, or given in sensation, and to maintain on the contrary that they belonged to our own thought itself, to the spontaneity of thought
- EnL",254
13688,"To that extent therefore, they were subjective
- EnL",52
13689,"And yet in spite of this, Kant gives the name objective to what is thought, to the universal and necessary, while he describes as subjective whatever is merely felt
- EnL",170
13690,"This arrangement apparently reverses the first-mentioned use of the word, and has caused Kant to be charged with confusing language
- EnL",137
13691,"But the charge is unfair if we more narrowly consider the facts of the case
- EnL",81
13692,"The vulgar believe that the objects of perception which confront them, such as an individual animal, or a single star, are independent and permanent existences, compared with which, thoughts are unsubstantial and dependent on something else
- EnL",246
13693,"In fact however the perceptions of sense are the properly dependent and secondary feature, while the thoughts are really independent and primary
- EnL",150
13694,"This being so, Kant gave the title objective to the intellectual factor, to the universal and necessary: and he was quite justified in so doing
- EnL",149
13695,"Our sensations on the other hand are subjective; for sensations lack stability in their own nature, and are no less fleeting and evanescent than thought is permanent and self-subsisting
- EnL",191
13696,"At the present day, the special line of distinction established by Kant between the subjective and objective is adopted by the phraseology of the educated world
- EnL",166
13698,"In the same acceptation we can distinguish in any scientific pursuit the objective and the subjective interest of the investigation
- EnL",137
13699,"But after all, objectivity of thought, in Kant's sense, is again to a certain extent subjective
- EnL",101
13700,"Thoughts, according to Kant, although universal and necessary categories, are only our thoughts--separated by an impassable gulf from the thing, as it exists apart from our knowledge
- EnL",188
13701,"But the true, objectivity of thinking means that the thoughts, far from being merely ours, must at the same time be the real essence of the things, and of whatever is an object to us
- EnL",188
13702,"Objective and subjective are convenient expressions in current use, the employment of which may easily lead to confusion
- EnL",126
13703,"Up to this point, the discussion has shown three meanings of objectivity
- EnL",78
13705,"Thirdly, as has been just explained, it means the thought-apprehended essence of the existing thing, in contradistinction from what is merely our thought, and what consequently is still separated from the thing itself, as it exists in independent essence
- EnL",260
13706,"The specific ground of the categories is declared by the Critical system to lie in the primary identity of the 'I' in thought,--what Kant calls the 'transcendental unity of self-consciousness'
- EnL",198
13707,"The impressions from feeling and perception are, if we look to their contents, a multiplicity or miscellany of elements: and the multiplicity is equally conspicuous in their form
- EnL",184
13708,"For sense is marked by a mutual exclusion of members; and that under two aspects, namely space and time, which, being the forms, that is to say, the universal type of perception, are themselves a priori
- EnL",208
13709,"This congeries, afforded by sensation and perception, must however be reduced to an identity or primary synthesis
- EnL",119
13710,"To accomplish this the 'I' brings it in relation to itself and unites it there in one consciousness which Kant calls 'pure apperception'
- EnL",142
13711,"The specific modes in which the Ego refers to itself the multiplicity of sense are the pure concepts of the understanding, the Categories
- EnL",143
13712,"Kant, it is well known, did not put himself to much trouble in discovering the categories
- EnL",95
13713,"Fortunately, the common logic offers to our hand an empirical classification of the kinds of judgment
- EnL",107
13714,"Now, to judge is the same as to think of a determinate object
- EnL",67
13715,"Hence the various modes of judgment, as enumerated to our hand, provide us with the several categories of thought
- EnL",119
13716,"To the philosophy of Fichte belongs the great merit of having called attention to the need of exhibiting the necessity of these categories and giving a genuine deduction of them
- EnL",183
13717,"Fichte ought to have produced at least one effect on the method of logic
- EnL",78
13718,"One might have expected that the general laws of thought, the usual stock-in-trade of logicians, or the classification of notions, judgments, and syllogisms, would be no longer taken merely from observation and so only empirically treated, but be deduced from thought itself
- EnL",280
13719,"If thought is to be capable of proving anything at all, if logic must insist upon the necessity of proofs, and if it proposes to teach the theory of demonstration, its first care should be to give a reason for its own subject-matter, and to see that it is necessary
- EnL",271
13720,"If we observe what we have before us primarily, we may describe it as a congeries or diversity: and in the categories we find the simple points or units, to which this congeries is made to converge
- EnL",203
13721,"The world of sense is a scene of mutual exclusion: its being is outside itself
- EnL",84
13722,"That is the fundamental feature of the sensible
- EnL",53
13723,"Red, in the same way, only subsists by being opposed to yellow and blue
- EnL",77
13724,"Now this other thing is outside the sensible; which latter is, only in so far as it is not the other, and only in so far as that other is
- EnL",143
13725,"But thought, or the 'Ego,' occupies a position the very reverse of the sensible, with its mutual exclusions, and its being outside itself
- EnL",143
13726,"The 'I' is the primary identity--at one with itself and all at home in itself
- EnL",83
13727,"The word 'I' expresses the mere act of bringing-to-bear-upon-self: and whatever is placed in this unit or focus, is affected by it and transformed into it
- EnL",160
13728,"The 'I' is as it were the crucible and the fire which consumes the loose plurality of sense and reduces it to unity
- EnL",121
13729,"This is the process which Kant calls pure apperception in distinction from the common apperception, to which the plurality it receives is a plurality still; whereas pure apperception is rather an act by which the 'I' makes the materials 'mine'
- EnL",249
13730,"This view has at least the merit of giving a correct expression to the nature of all consciousness
- EnL",104
13731,"The tendency of all man's endeavours is to understand the world, to appropriate and subdue it to himself: and to this end the positive reality of the world must be as it were crushed and pounded, in other words, idealised
- EnL",227
13732,"At the same time we must note that it is not the mere act of our personal self-consciousness, which introduces an absolute unity into the variety of sense
- EnL",160
13733,"Rather, this identity is itself the absolute
- EnL",50
13734,"The absolute is, as it were, so kind as to leave individual things to their own enjoyment, and it again drives them back to the absolute unity
- EnL",148
13735,"Kant's meaning of transcendental may be gathered by the way he distinguishes it from transcendent
- EnL",103
13736,"The transcendent may be said to be what steps out beyond the categories of the understanding: a sense in which the term is first employed in mathematics
- EnL",158
13737,"Thus in geometry you are told to conceive the circumference of a circle as formed of an infinite number of infinitely small straight lines
- EnL",144
13738,"In other words, characteristics which the understanding holds to be totally different, the straight line and the curve, are expressly invested with identity
- EnL",162
13739,"Another transcendent of the same kind is the self-consciousness which is identical with itself and infinite in itself, as distinguished from the ordinary consciousness which derives its form and tone from finite materials
- EnL",227
13740,"That unity of self-consciousness, however, Kant called transcendental only; and he meant thereby that the unity was only in our minds and did not attach to the objects apart from our knowledge of them
- EnL",206
13741,"It is quite true however that the categories are not contained in the sensation as it is given us
- EnL",103
13742,"Now it is this unity that is not found in the sensation
- EnL",61
13743,"The same thing happens if we conceive two events to stand in the relation of cause and effect
- EnL",99
13744,"The senses only inform us of the two several occurrences which follow each other in time
- EnL",94
13745,"But that the one is cause, the other effect,--in other words, the causal nexus between the two,--is not perceived by sense; it is only evident to thought
- EnL",159
13746,"Still, though the categories, such as unity, or cause and effect, are strictly the property of thought, it by no means follows that they must be ours merely and not also characteristics of the objects
- EnL",206
13747,"Kant however confines them to the subject-mind, and his philosophy may be styled subjective idealism: for he holds that both the form and the matter of knowledge are supplied by the Ego--or knowing subject--the form by our intellectual, the matter by our sentient ego
- EnL",273
13748,"So far as regards the content of this subjective idealism, not a word need be wasted
- EnL",90
13749,"It might perhaps at first sight be imagined, that objects would lose their reality when their unity was transferred to the subject
- EnL",136
13750,"But neither we nor the objects would have anything to gain by the mere fact that they possessed being
- EnL",107
13751,"The main point is not, that they are, but what they are, and whether or not their content is true
- EnL",103
13752,"It does no good to the things to say merely that they have being
- EnL",70
13753,"What has being, will also cease to be when time creeps over it
- EnL",68
13754,"It might also be alleged that subjective idealism tended to promote self-conceit
- EnL",86
13755,"But surely if a man's world be the sum of his sensible perceptions, he has no reason to be vain of such a world
- EnL",117
13756,"Laying aside therefore as unimportant this distinction between subjective and objective, we are chiefly interested in knowing what a thing is: ie its content, which is no more objective than it is subjective
- EnL",213
13757,"If mere existence be enough to make objectivity, even a crime is objective: but it is an existence which is nullity at the core, as is definitely made apparent when the day of punishment comes
- EnL",198
13758,"The Categories may be viewed in two aspects
- EnL",49
13759,"On the one hand it is by their instrumentality that the mere perception of sense rises to objectivity and experience
- EnL",122
13760,"On the other hand these notions are unities in our consciousness merely: they are consequently conditioned by the material given to them, and having nothing of their own they can be applied to use only within the range of experience
- EnL",238
13761,"But the other constituent of experience, the impressions of feeling and perception, is not one whit less subjective than the categories
- EnL",141
13762,"To assert that the categories taken by themselves are empty can scarcely be right, seeing that they have a content, at all events, in the special stamp and significance which they possess
- EnL",193
13763,"Of course the content of the categories is not perceptible to the senses, nor is it in time and space: but that is rather a merit than a defect
- EnL",149
13764,"A glimpse of this meaning of content may be observed to affect our ordinary thinking
- EnL",90
13766,"Even the popular voice thus recognises that something more than the facts of sense is needed to make a work pregnant with matter
- EnL",134
13767,"And what is this additional desideratum but thoughts, or in the first instance the categories?
- EnL",100
13769,"Only let the progress not be misunderstood
- EnL",48
13770,"The logical Ideal does not thereby come into possession of a content originally foreign to it: but by its own native action is specialised and developed to Nature and Mind
- EnL",177
13771,"It follows that the categories are no fit terms to express the Absolute--the Absolute not being given in perception;--and Understanding, or knowledge by means of the categories, is consequently incapable of knowing the Things-in-themselves
- EnL",245
13772,"The Thing-in-itself (and under 'thing' is embraced even Mind and God) expresses the object when we leave out of sight all that consciousness makes of it, all its emotional aspects, and all specific thoughts of it
- EnL",218
13773,"It is easy to see what is left,--utter abstraction, total emptiness, only described still as an 'other-world'--the negative of every image, feeling, and definite thought
- EnL",175
13775,"The negative characteristic which this abstract identity receives as an object, is also enumerated among the categories of Kant, and is no less familiar than the empty identity aforesaid
- EnL",192
13776,"Hence one can only read with surprise the perpetual remark that we do not know the Thing-in-itself
- EnL",104
13777,"On the contrary there is nothing we can know so easily
- EnL",60
13778,"It is Reason, the faculty of the Unconditioned, which discovers the conditioned nature of the knowledge comprised in experience
- EnL",133
13779,"What is thus called the object of Reason, the Infinite or Unconditioned, is nothing but self-sameness, or the primary identity of the 'Ego' in thought (mentioned in § 42)
- EnL",176
13780,"Reason itself is the name given to the abstract 'Ego' or thought, which makes this pure identity its aim or object (cf
- EnL",124
13781,"Now this identity, having no definite attribute at all, can receive no illumination from the truths of experience, for the reason that these refer always to definite facts
- EnL",177
13782,"Such is the sort of Unconditioned that is supposed to be the absolute truth of Reason,--what is termed the Idea; whilst the cognitions of experience are reduced to the level of untruth and declared to be appearances
- EnL",221
13783,"Kant was the first definitely to signalise the distinction between Reason and Understanding
- EnL",97
13784,"The object of the former, as he applied the term, was the infinite and unconditioned, of the latter the finite and conditioned
- EnL",132
13785,"Kant did valuable service when he enforced the finite character of the cognitions of the understanding founded merely upon experience, and stamped their contents with the name of appearance
- EnL",195
13786,"But his mistake was to stop at the purely negative point of view, and to limit the unconditionality of Reason to an abstract self-sameness without any shade of distinction
- EnL",177
13787,"It degrades Reason to a finite and conditioned thing, to identify it with a mere stepping beyond the finite and conditioned range of understanding
- EnL",152
13788,"The real infinite, far from being a mere transcendence of the finite, always involves the absorption of the finite into its own fuller nature
- EnL",147
13789,"In the same way Kant restored the Idea to its proper dignity: vindicating it for Reason, as a thing distinct from abstract analytic determinations or from the merely sensible conceptions which usually appropriate to themselves the name of ideas
- EnL",250
13790,"But as respects the Idea also, he never got beyond its negative aspect, as what ought to be but is not
- EnL",108
13791,"The view that the objects of immediate consciousness, which constitute the body of experience, are mere appearances (phenomena), was another important result of the Kantian philosophy
- EnL",189
13793,"The very opposite is the truth
- EnL",36
13794,"The things immediately known are mere appearances--in other words, the ground of their being is not in themselves but in something else
- EnL",141
13795,"But then comes the important step of defining what this something else is
- EnL",79
13796,"According to Kant, the things that we know about are to us appearances only, and we can never know their essential nature, which belongs to another world we cannot approach
- EnL",178
13797,"Plain minds have not unreasonably taken exception to this subjective idealism, with its reduction of the facts of consciousness to a purely personal world, created by ourselves alone
- EnL",188
13798,"For the true statement of the case is rather as follows
- EnL",61
13799,"The things of which we have direct consciousness are mere phenomena, not for us only, but in their own nature; and the true and proper case of these things, finite as they are, is to have their existence founded not in themselves but in the universal divine Idea
- EnL",268
13800,"This view of things, it is true, is as idealist as Kant's; but in contradistinction to the subjective idealism of the Critical philosophy should be termed absolute idealism
- EnL",178
13801,"Absolute idealism, however, though it is far in advance of vulgar realism, is by no means merely restricted to philosophy
- EnL",127
13802,"It lies at the root of all religion; for religion too believes the actual world we see, the sum total of existence, to be created and governed by God
- EnL",155
13803,"But it is not enough simply to indicate the existence of the object of Reason
- EnL",83
13804,"Curiosity impels us to seek for knowledge of this identity, this empty thing-in-itself
- EnL",92
13805,"Now knowledge means such an acquaintance with the object as apprehends its distinct and special subject-matter
- EnL",116
13806,"But such subject-matter involves a complex inter-connexion in the object itself, and supplies a ground of connexion with many other objects
- EnL",145
13807,"In the present case, to express the nature of the features of the Infinite or Thing-in-itself, Reason would have nothing except the categories: and in any endeavour so to employ them Reason becomes over-soaring or 'transcendent'
- EnL",234
13808,"Here begins the second stage of the Criticism of Reason--which, as an independent piece of work, is more valuable than the first
- EnL",134
13809,"The first part, as has been explained above, teaches that the categories originate in the unity of self-consciousness; that any knowledge which is gained by their means has nothing objective in it, and that the very objectivity claimed for them is only subjective
- EnL",269
13810,"So far as this goes, the Kantian Criticism presents that 'common' type of idealism known as Subjective Idealism
- EnL",117
13813,"It is worth while to see what decision Kant arrives at on the subject of metaphysic, as this application of the categories to the unconditioned is called
- EnL",159
13814,"His method of procedure we shall here briefly state and criticise
- EnL",71
13815,"Now the method of the old metaphysic, as Kant correctly states it, consisted in substituting for these statements of experience the corresponding categories or metaphysical terms
- EnL",184
13816,"Thus arise these four new propositions: (a) the Soul is a substance: (b) it is a simple substance: (c) it is numerically identical at the various periods of existence: (d) it stands in relation to space
- EnL",208
13817,"Kant discusses this translation, and draws attention to the Paralogism or mistake of confounding one kind of truth with another
- EnL",133
13818,"He points out that empirical attributes have here been replaced by categories: and shows that we are not entitled to argue from the former to the latter, or to put the latter in place of the former
- EnL",203
13819,"This criticism obviously but repeats the observation of Hume (§ 39) that the categories as a whole,--ideas of universality and necessity,--are entirely absent from sensation; and that the empirical fact both in form and contents differs from its intellectual formulation
- EnL",276
13820,"If the purely empirical fact were held to constitute the credentials of the thought, then no doubt it would be indispensable to be able precisely to identify the 'idea' in the 'impression'
- EnL",194
13822,"But we have seen above, that according to Kant all knowledge, even experience, consists in thinking our impressions--in other words, in transforming into intellectual categories the attributes primarily belonging to sensation
- EnL",231
13823,"Unquestionably one good result of the Kantian criticism was that it emancipated mental philosophy from the 'soul-thing,' from the categories, and, consequently, from questions about the simplicity, complexity, materiality, &c of the soul
- EnL",243
13824,"But even for the common sense of ordinary men, the true point of view, from which the inadmissibility of these forms best appears, will be, not that they are thoughts, but that thoughts of such a stamp neither can nor do contain truth
- EnL",240
13825,"If thought and phenomenon do not perfectly correspond to one another, we are free at least to choose which of the two shall be held the defaulter
- EnL",151
13827,"But as to the actual content of the thought, no question is raised
- EnL",72
13828,"Paralogisms are a species of unsound syllogism, the especial vice of which consists in employing one and the same word in the two premisses with a different meaning
- EnL",170
13829,"According to Kant the method adopted by the rational psychology of the old metaphysicians, when they assumed that the qualities of the phenomenal soul, as given in experience, formed part of its own real essence, was based upon such a Paralogism
- EnL",251
13830,"Nor can it be denied that predicates like simplicity, permanence, &c, are inapplicable to the soul
- EnL",104
13831,"But their unfitness is not due to the ground assigned by Kant, that Reason, by applying them, would exceed its appointed bounds
- EnL",133
13832,"The true ground is that this style of abstract terms is not good enough for the soul, which is very; much more than a mere simple or unchangeable sort of thing
- EnL",165
13833,"And thus, for example, while the soul may be admitted to be simple self-sameness, it is at the same time active and institutes distinctions in its own nature
- EnL",163
13834,"But whatever is merely or abstractly simple is as such also a mere dead thing
- EnL",83
13835,"By his polemic against the metaphysic of the past Kant discarded those predicates from the soul or mind
- EnL",109
13836,"He did well; but when he came to state his reasons, his failure is apparent
- EnL",81
13837,"In other words it maintains two opposite propositions about the same object, and in such a way that each of them has to be maintained with equal necessity
- EnL",160
13838,"From this it follows that the body of cosmical fact, the specific statements descriptive of which run into contradiction, cannot be a self-subsistent reality, but only an appearance
- EnL",187
13839,"The explanation offered by Kant alleges that the contradiction does not affect the object in its own proper essence, but attaches only to the Reason which seeks to comprehend it
- EnL",183
13840,"In this way the suggestion was broached that the contradiction is occasioned by the subject-matter itself, or by the intrinsic quality of the categories
- EnL",158
13841,"And to offer the idea that the contradiction introduced into the world of Reason by the categories of Understanding is inevitable and essential, was to make one of the most important steps in the progress of Modern Philosophy
- EnL",231
13842,"But the more important the issue thus raised the more trivial was the solution
- EnL",84
13843,"Its only motive was an excess of tenderness for the things of the world
- EnL",77
13844,"The blemish of contradiction, it seems, could not be allowed to mar the essence of the world: but there could be no objection to attach it to the thinking Reason, to the essence of mind
- EnL",191
13845,"Probably nobody will feel disposed to deny that the phenomenal world presents contradictions to the observing mind; meaning by 'phenomenal' the world as it presents itself to the senses and understanding, to the subjective mind
- EnL",233
13847,"It is no escape to turn round and explain that Reason falls into contradiction only by applying the categories
- EnL",116
13848,"For this application of the categories is maintained to be necessary, and Reason is not supposed to be equipped with any other forms but the categories for the purpose of cognition
- EnL",186
13849,"But cognition is determining and determinate thinking: so that, if Reason be mere empty indeterminate thinking, it thinks nothing
- EnL",135
13850,"And if in the end Reason be reduced to mere identity without diversity (see next §), it will in the end also win a happy release from contradiction at the slight sacrifice of all its facts and contents
- EnL",207
13851,"It may also be noted that his failure to make a more thorough study of Antinomy was one of the reasons why Kant enumerated only four Antinomies
- EnL",149
13852,"These four attracted his notice, because, as may be seen in his discussion of the so-called Paralogisms of Reason, he assumed the list of the categories as a basis of his argument
- EnL",185
13853,"Employing what has subsequently become a favourite fashion, he simply put the object under a rubric otherwise ready to hand, instead of deducing its characteristics from its notion
- EnL",186
13855,"To be aware of this and to know objects in this property of theirs, makes a vital part in a philosophical theory
- EnL",118
13856,"For the property thus indicated is what we shall afterwards describe as the Dialectical influence in logic
- EnL",112
13857,"According to Kant, however, thought has a natural tendency to issue in contradictions or antinomies, whenever it seeks to apprehend the infinite
- EnL",150
13859,"But here too Kant, as we must add, never got beyond the negative result that the thing-in-itself is unknowable, and never penetrated to the discovery of what the antinomies really and positively mean
- EnL",205
13860,"That true and positive meaning of the antinomies is this: that every actual thing involves a coexistence of opposed, elements
- EnL",131
13861,"Consequently to know, or, in other words, to comprehend an object is equivalent to being conscious of it as a concrete unity of opposed determinations
- EnL",156
13862,"Kant, on the other hand, tried to prove that the statements, issuing through this method, could be met by other statements of contrary import with equal warrant and equal necessity
- EnL",186
13863,"In the enumeration of these antinomies he narrowed his ground to the cosmology of the old metaphysical system, and in his discussion made out four antinomies, a number which rests upon the list of the categories
- EnL",217
13864,"In the second antinomy we have a discussion of the dilemma: Matter must be conceived either as endlessly divisible, or as consisting of atoms
- EnL",147
13866,"Finally, the fourth antinomy is the dilemma: Either the world as a whole has a cause or it is uncaused
- EnL",108
13867,"The method which Kant follows in discussing these antinomies is as follows
- EnL",80
13868,"He puts the two propositions implied in the dilemma over against each other as thesis and antithesis, and seeks to prove both: that is to say he tries to exhibit them as inevitably issuing from reflection on the question
- EnL",226
13869,"He particularly protests against the charge of being a special pleader and of grounding his reasoning on illusions
- EnL",120
13870,"Speaking honestly, however, the arguments which Kant offers for his thesis and antithesis are mere shams of demonstration
- EnL",127
13871,"The thing to be proved is invariably implied in the assumption he starts from, and the speciousness of his proofs is only due to his prolix and apagogic mode of procedure
- EnL",176
13875,"The same observations apply to the rest of the antinomies
- EnL",63
13876,"Take, for example, the antinomy of freedom and necessity
- EnL",62
13878,"But in comparison with an unalloyed identity, every defining term as such seems to the understanding to be only a limit and a negation: every reality accordingly must be taken as limitless, ie undefined
- EnL",208
13879,"Accordingly God, when He is defined to be the sum of all realities, the most real of beings, turns into a mere abstract
- EnL",125
13880,"And the only term under which that most real of real, things can be defined is that of Being--itself the height of abstraction
- EnL",132
13881,"These are the two elements, abstract identity, on one hand, which is spoken of in this place as the notion; and Being on the other,--which Reason seeks to unify
- EnL",166
13882,"And their union is the Ideal of Reason
- EnL",44
13883,"To carry out this unification two ways or two forms are admissible
- EnL",72
13884,"Either we may begin with Being and proceed to the abstraction of Thought: or the movement may begin with the abstraction and end in Being
- EnL",143
13885,"We shall, in the first place, start from Being
- EnL",52
13886,"But Being, in its natural aspect, presents itself to view as a Being of infinite variety, a World in all its plenitude
- EnL",124
13887,"And this world may be regarded in two ways: first, as a collection of innumerable unconnected facts; and second, as a collection of innumerable facts in mutual relation, giving evidence of design
- EnL",201
13888,"The first aspect is emphasised in the Cosmological proof: the latter in the proofs of Natural Theology
- EnL",108
13889,"Suppose now that this fulness of being passes under the agency of thought
- EnL",79
13890,"Then it is stripped of its isolation and unconnectedness, and viewed as a universal and absolutely necessary being which determines itself and acts by general purposes or laws
- EnL",181
13891,"And this necessary and self-determined being, different from the being at the commencement, is God
- EnL",104
13892,"The main force of Kant's criticism on this process attacks it for being a syllogising, ie a transition
- EnL",108
13893,"Perceptions, and that aggregate of perceptions we call the world, exhibit as they stand no traces of that universality which they afterwards receive from the purifying act of thought
- EnL",188
13894,"The empirical conception of the world therefore gives no warrant for the idea of universality
- EnL",99
13896,"Man is essentially a thinker: and therefore sound Common Sense, as well as Philosophy, will not yield up their right of rising to God from and out of the empirical view of the world
- EnL",187
13897,"The only basis on which this rise is possible is the thinking study of the world, not the bare sensuous, animal, attuition of it
- EnL",134
13898,"Thought and thought alone has eyes for the essence, substance, universal power, and ultimate design of the world
- EnL",118
13899,"And what men call the proofs of God's existence are, rightly understood, ways of describing and analysing the native course of the mind, the course of thought thinking the data of the senses
- EnL",196
13900,"The rise of thought beyond the world of sense, its passage from the finite to the infinite, the leap into the super-sensible which it takes when it snaps asunder the chain of sense, all this transition is thought and nothing but thought
- EnL",242
13901,"Say there is no such passage, and you say there is to be no thinking
- EnL",74
13902,"And in sooth, animals make no such transition
- EnL",51
13903,"They never get further than sensation and the perception of the senses, and in consequence they have no religion
- EnL",118
13904,"Both on general grounds, and in the particular case, there are two remarks to be made upon the criticism of this exaltation in thought
- EnL",140
13905,"The first remark deals with the question of form
- EnL",54
13906,"The merely syllogistic thinker may deem this starting-point a solid basis and suppose that it remains throughout in the same empirical light, left at last as it was at the first
- EnL",183
13907,"In this case, the bearing of the beginning upon the conclusion to which it leads has a purely affirmative aspect, as if we were only reasoning from one thing which is and continues to be, to another thing which in like manner is
- EnL",234
13908,"But the great error is to restrict our notions of the nature of thought to its form in understanding alone
- EnL",112
13909,"To think think the phenomenal world rather, means to re-cast its form, and transmute it into a universal
- EnL",110
13910,"And thus the action-of-thought, has also, negative effect upon its basis: and the matter of sensation, when it receives the stamp of universality, at once loses its first and phenomenal shape
- EnL",197
13911,"By the removal and negation of the shell, the kernel within the sense; v percept is brought to the light (§§ 13 and 23)
- EnL",125
13912,"And it is because they do not, with sufficient prominence, express the negative features implied in the exaltation of the mind from the world to God, that the metaphysical proofs of the being of a God are defective interpretations and descriptions of the process
- EnL",268
13913,"If the world is only a sum of incidents, it follows that it is also deciduous and phenomenal, in esse and posse null
- EnL",122
13914,"That upward spring of the mind signifies, that the being which the world has is only a semblance, no real being, no absolute truth; it signifies that, beyond and above that appearance, truth abides in God, so that true being is another name for God
- EnL",254
13915,"The process of exaltation might thus appear to be transition and to involve a means, but it is not a whit less true, that every trace of transition and means is absorbed; since the world, which might have seemed to be the means of reaching God, is explained to be a nullity
- EnL",279
13916,"Unless the being of the world is nullified, the point d'appui for the exaltation is lost
- EnL",94
13917,"In this way the apparent means vanishes, and the process of derivation is cancelled in the very act by which it proceeds
- EnL",126
13918,"It is the affirmative aspect of this relation, as supposed to subsist between two things, either of which is as much as the other, which Jacobi mainly has in his eye when he attacks the demonstrations of the understanding
- EnL",227
13919,"Justly censuring them for seeking conditions (ie the world) for the unconditioned, he remarks that the Infinite or God must on such a method be presented as dependent and derivative
- EnL",187
13920,"But that elevation, as it takes place in the mind, serves to correct this semblance: in fact, it has no other meaning than to correct that semblance
- EnL",154
13922,"To explain what we mean by the neglect of the negative factor in thought, we may refer by way of illustration to the charges of Pantheism and Atheism brought against the doctrines of Spinoza
- EnL",196
13923,"The absolute Substance of Spinoza certainly falls short of absolute spirit, and it is a right and proper requirement that God should be defined as absolute spirit
- EnL",168
13924,"But when the definition in Spinoza is said to identify the world with God, and to confound God with nature and the finite world, it is implied that the finite world possesses a genuine actuality and affirmative reality
- EnL",224
13925,"If this assumption be admitted, of course a union of God with the world renders God completely finite, and degrades Him to the bare finite and adventitious congeries of existence
- EnL",184
13926,"But there are two objections to be noted
- EnL",46
13927,"In the first place Spinoza does not define God as the unity of God with the world, but as the union of thought with extension, that is, with the material world
- EnL",165
13928,"And secondly, even if we accept this awkward popular statement as to this unity, it would still be true that the system of Spinoza was not Atheism but Acosmism, defining the world to be an appearance lacking in true reality
- EnL",229
13929,"A philosophy, which affirms that God and God-alone is, should not be stigmatised as atheistic, when even those nations which worship the ape, the cow, or images of stone and brass, are credited with some religion
- EnL",218
13931,"Human nature, not much to its credit, is more ready to believe that a system denies God, than that it denies the world
- EnL",124
13932,"A denial of God seems so much more intelligible than a denial of the world
- EnL",80
13933,"The second remark bears on the criticism of the material propositions to which that elevation in thought in the first instance leads
- EnL",138
13934,"If these propositions have for their predicate such terms as substance of the world, its necessary essence, cause which regulates and directs it according to design, they are certainly inadequate to express what is or ought to be understood by God
- EnL",253
13935,"Yet apart from the trick of adopting a preliminary popular conception of God, and criticising a result by this assumed standard, it is certain that these characteristics have great value, and are necessary factors in the idea of God
- EnL",238
13936,"But if we wish in this way to bring before thought the genuine idea of God, and give its true value and expression to the central truth, we must be careful not to start from a subordinate level of facts
- EnL",208
13937,"To speak of the 'merely contingent' things of the world is a very inadequate description of the premisses
- EnL",111
13938,"The organic structures, and the evidence they afford of mutual adaptation, belong to a higher province, the province of animated nature
- EnL",141
13940,"God is more than life: He is Spirit
- EnL",41
13941,"And therefore if the thought of the Absolute takes a starting-point for its rise, and desires to take the nearest, the most true and adequate starting-point will be found in the nature of spirit alone
- EnL",206
13942,"The other way of unification by which to realise the Ideal of Reason is to set out from the abstractum of Thought and seek to characterise it: for which purpose Being is the only available term
- EnL",199
13943,"This is the method of the Ontological proof
- EnL",49
13944,"The opposition, here presented from a merely subjective point of view, lies between Thought and Being; whereas in the first way of junction, being is common to the two sides of the antithesis, and the contrast lies only between its individualisation and universality
- EnL",272
13945,"Understanding meets this second way with what is implicitly the same objection, as it made to the first
- EnL",109
13946,"It denied that the empirical involves the universal: so it denies that the universal involves the specialisation, which specialisation in this instance is being
- EnL",166
13947,"In other words it says: Being cannot be deduced from the notion by any analysis
- EnL",85
13948,"The uniformly favourable reception and acceptance which attended Kant's criticism of the Ontological proof was undoubtedly due to the illustration which he made use of
- EnL",173
13950,"Nothing can be more obvious than that anything we only think or conceive is not on that account actual: that mental representation, and even notional comprehension, always falls short of being
- EnL",198
13951,"Still it may not unfairly be styled a barbarism in language, when the name of notion is given to things like a hundred sovereigns
- EnL",135
13952,"And, putting that mistake aside, those who perpetually urge against the philosophic Idea the difference between Being and Thought, might have admitted that philosophers were not wholly ignorant of the fact
- EnL",211
13953,"Can there be any proposition more trite than this?
- EnL",56
13954,"But after all, it is well to remember, when we speak of God, that we have an object of another kind than any hundred sovereigns, and unlike any one particular notion, representation, or however else it may be styled
- EnL",221
13955,"It is in fact this and this alone which marks everything finite:--its being in time and space is discrepant from its notion
- EnL",129
13956,"God, on the contrary, expressly has to be what can only be 'thought as existing'; His notion involves being
- EnL",113
13957,"It is this unity of the notion and being that constitutes the notion of God
- EnL",81
13958,"If this were all, we should have only a formal expression of the divine nature which would not really go beyond a statement of the nature of the notion itself
- EnL",164
13959,"And that the notion, in its most abstract terms, involves being is plain
- EnL",78
13960,"For the notion, whatever other determination it may receive, is at least reference back on itself, which results by abolishing the intermediation, and thus is immediate
- EnL",174
13961,"And what is that reference to self, but being?
- EnL",52
13962,"Certainly it would be strange if the notion, the very inmost of mind, if even the 'Ego,' or above all, the concrete totality we call God, were not rich enough to include so poor a category as being, the very poorest and most abstract of all
- EnL",246
13963,"For, if we look at the thought it holds, nothing can be more insignificant than being
- EnL",91
13964,"And yet there may be something still more insignificant than being,--that which at first sight is perhaps supposed to be, an external and sensible existence, like that of the paper lying before me
- EnL",202
13965,"However, in this matter, nobody proposes to speak of the sensible existence of a limited and perishable thing
- EnL",115
13966,"Besides, the petty stricture of the Kritik that 'thought and being are different' can at most molest the path of the human mind from the thought of God to the certainty that He is: it cannot take it away
- EnL",209
13967,"It is this process of transition, depending on the absolute inseparability of the thought of God from His being, for which its proper authority has been re-vindicated in the theory of faith or immediate knowledge,--whereof hereafter
- EnL",238
13968,"In this way thought, at its highest pitch, has to go outside for any determinateness: and although it is continually termed Reason, is out-and-out abstract thinking
- EnL",170
13969,"And the result of all is that Reason supplies nothing beyond the formal unity required to simplify and systematise experiences; it is a canon, not an organon of truth, and can furnish only a criticism of knowledge, not a doctrine of the infinite
- EnL",251
13970,"In its final analysis this criticism is summed up in the assertion that in strictness thought is only the indeterminate unity and the action of this indeterminate unity
- EnL",174
13971,"Kant undoubtedly held reason to be the faculty of the     unconditioned; but if reason be reduced to abstract identity     only, it by implication renounces its unconditionality and is     in reality no better than empty understanding
- EnL",240
13972,"For reason is     unconditioned, only in so far as its character and quality are not     due to an extraneous and foreign content, only in so far as it     is self-characterising, and thus, in point of content, is its own     master
- EnL",238
13973,"Kant, however, expressly explains that the action of reason     consists solely in applying the categories to systematise the     matter given by perception, e to place it in an outside order,     under the guidance of the principle of non-contradiction
- EnL",259
13974,"Its office is to give objective, imperative laws of freedom,--laws, that is, which state what ought to happen
- EnL",115
13975,"The warrant for thus assuming thought to be an activity which makes itself felt objectively, that is, to be really a Reason, is the alleged possibility of proving practical freedom by experience, that is, of showing it in the phenomenon of self-consciousness
- EnL",264
13977,"What, then, is to serve as the law which the Practical Reason embraces and obeys, and as the criterion in its act of self-determination?
- EnL",142
13978,"There is no rule at hand but the same abstract identity of understanding as before: There must be no contradiction in the act of self-determination
- EnL",153
13979,"Hence the Practical Reason never shakes off the formalism which is represented as the climax of the Theoretical Reason
- EnL",124
13981,"The free self-determination which Kant denied to the speculative,     he has expressly vindicated for the practical reason
- EnL",128
13982,"To many minds     this particular aspect of the Kantian philosophy made it welcome;     and that for good reasons
- EnL",119
13983,"To estimate rightly what we owe to     Kant in the matter, we ought to set before our minds the form of     practical philosophy and in particular of 'moral philosophy,' which     prevailed in his time
- EnL",207
13984,"It may be generally described as a system     of Eudaemonism, which, when asked what man's chief end ought to     be, replied Happiness
- EnL",141
13985,"And by happiness Eudaemonism understood the     satisfaction of the private appetites, wishes and wants of the     man: thus raising the contingent and particular into a principle     for the will and its actualisation
- EnL",224
13988,"To the practical reason, on the contrary,     he has expressly allowed a positive infinity, by ascribing to the     will the power of modifying itself in universal modes, ie by     thought
- EnL",194
13989,"Such a power the will undoubtedly has: and it is well     to remember that man is free only in so far as he possesses it     and avails himself of it in his conduct
- EnL",170
13990,"But a recognition of the     existence of this power is not enough and does not avail to tell     us what are the contents of the will or practical reason
- EnL",160
13991,"Hence to     say, that a man must make the Good the content of his will, raises     the question, what that content is, and what are the means of     ascertaining what good is
- EnL",181
13992,"Nor does one get over the difficulty by     the principle that the will must be consistent with itself, or by     the precept to do duty for the sake of duty
- EnL",163
13994,"Experience presents such universalised particulars in the products of Art and of organic nature
- EnL",101
13995,"The capital feature in Kant's Criticism of the Judgment is, that in it he gave a representation and a name, if not even an intellectual expression, to the Idea
- EnL",165
13996,"Such a representation, as an Intuitive Understanding, or an inner adaptation, suggests a universal which is at the same time apprehended as essentially a concrete unity, It is in these aperçus alone that the Kantian philosophy rises to the speculative height
- EnL",264
13997,"Schiller, and others, have found in the idea of artistic beauty, where thought and sensuous conception have grown together into one, a way of escape from the abstract and separatist understanding
- EnL",201
13998,"Others have found the same relief in the perception and consciousness of life and of living things, whether that life be natural or intellectual--The work of Art, as well as the living individual, is, it must be owned, of limited content
- EnL",243
13999,"But in the postulated harmony of nature (or necessity) and free purpose,--in the final purpose of the world conceived as realised, Kant has put before us the Idea, comprehensive even in its content
- EnL",203
14000,"Yet what may be called the laziness of thought, when dealing with this supreme Idea, finds a too easy mode of evasion in the 'ought to be': instead of the actual realisation of the ultimate end, it clings hard to the disjunction of the notion from reality
- EnL",261
14001,"Yet if thought will not think the ideal realised, the senses and the intuition can at any rate see it in the present reality of living organisms and of the beautiful in Art
- EnL",178
14002,"And consequently Kant's remarks on these objects were well adapted to lead the mind on to grasp and think the concrete Idea
- EnL",129
14003,"We are thus led to conceive a different relation between the universal of understanding and the particular of perception, than that on which the theory of the Theoretical and Practical Reason is founded
- EnL",208
14004,"But while this is so, it is not supplemented by a recognition that the former is the genuine relation and the very truth
- EnL",126
14005,"Instead of that, the unity (of universal with particular) is accepted only as it exists in finite phenomena, and is adduced only as a fact of experience
- EnL",158
14006,"Such experience, at first only personal, may come from two sources
- EnL",72
14008,"It may also be due to Taste, the feeling of congruity between the free play of intuition or imagination and the uniformity of understanding
- EnL",145
14009,"The principle by which the Reflective faculty of Judgment regulates and arranges the products of animated nature is described as the End or final cause,--the notion in action, the universal at once determining and determinate in itself
- EnL",241
14010,"At the same time Kant is careful to discard the conception of external or finite adaptation, in which the End is only an adventitious form for the means and material in which it is realised
- EnL",195
14011,"In the living organism, on the contrary, the final cause is a moulding principle and an energy immanent in the matter, and every member is in its turn a means as well as an end
- EnL",182
14012,"Such an Idea evidently radically transforms the relation which the understanding institutes between means and ends, between subjectivity and objectivity
- EnL",158
14013,"And yet in the face of this unification, the End or design is subsequently explained to be a cause which exists and acts subjectively, ie as our idea only: and teleology is accordingly explained to be only a principle of criticism, purely personal to our understanding
- EnL",274
14014,"After the Critical philosophy had settled that Reason can know phenomena only, there would still have been an option for animated nature between two equally subjective modes of thought
- EnL",190
14015,"Even according to Kant's own exposition, there would have been an obligation to admit, in the case of natural productions, a knowledge not confined to the categories of quality, cause and effect, composition, constituents, and so on
- EnL",238
14016,"The principle of inward adaptation or design, had it been kept to and carried out in scientific application, would have led to a different and a higher method of observing nature
- EnL",184
14017,"If we adopt this principle, the Idea, when all limitations were removed from it, would appear as follows
- EnL",110
14018,"The universality moulded by Reason, and described as the absolute and final end or the Good, would be realised in the world, and realised moreover by means of a third thing, the power which proposes this End as well as realises it,--that is, God
- EnL",251
14019,"Thus in Him, who is the absolute truth, those oppositions of universal and individual, subjective and objective, are solved and explained to be neither self-subsistent nor true
- EnL",182
14020,"But Good,--which is thus put forward as the final cause of the world,--has been already described as only our good, the moral law of our Practical Reason
- EnL",159
14022,"But, further, this harmony is met by the revival and re-assertion of the antithesis, which it by its own principle had nullified
- EnL",134
14023,"The harmony is then described as merely subjective, something which merely ought to be, and which at the same time is not real,--a mere article of faith, possessing a subjective certainty, but without truth, or that objectivity which is proper to the Idea
- EnL",261
14024,"This contradiction may seem to be disguised by adjourning the realisation of the Idea to a future, to a time when the Idea will also be
- EnL",141
14025,"But a sensuous condition like time is the reverse of a reconciliation of the discrepancy; and an infinite progression--which is the corresponding image adopted by the understanding--on the very face of it only repeats and re-enacts the contradiction
- EnL",255
14026,"A general remark may still be offered on the result to which the Critical philosophy led as to the nature of knowledge; a result which has grown one of the current 'idols' or axiomatic beliefs of the day
- EnL",209
14027,"In every dualistic system, and especially in that of Kant, the fundamental defect makes itself visible in the inconsistency of unifying at one moment, what a moment before had been explained to be independent and therefore incapable of unification
- EnL",253
14029,"Philosophising of this kind wants the little penetration needed to discover, that this shuffling only evidences how unsatisfactory each one of the two terms is
- EnL",165
14030,"And it fails simply because it is incapable of bringing two thoughts together
- EnL",83
14032,"But 'natural' is the wrong word here
- EnL",42
14033,"The things of nature are limited and are natural things only to such extent as they are not aware of their universal limit, or to such extent as their mode or quality is a limit from our point of view, and not from their own
- EnL",230
14034,"No one knows, or even feels, that anything is a limit or defect, until he is at the same time above and beyond it
- EnL",119
14035,"Living beings, for example, possess the privilege of pain which is denied to the inanimate: even with living beings, a single mode or quality passes into the feeling of a negative
- EnL",185
14036,"For living beings as such possess within them a universal vitality, which overpasses and includes the single mode; and thus, as they maintain themselves in the negative of themselves, they feel the contradiction to exist within them
- EnL",238
14037,"But the contradiction is within them, only in so far as one and the same subject includes both the universality of their sense of life, and the individual mode which is in negation with it
- EnL",194
14038,"This illustration will show how a limit or imperfection in knowledge comes to be termed a limit or imperfection, only when it is compared with the actually-present Idea of the universal, of a total and perfect
- EnL",215
14039,"A very little consideration might show, that to call a thing finite or limited proves by implication the very presence of the infinite and unlimited, and that our knowledge of a limit can only be when the unlimited is on this side in consciousness
- EnL",253
14040,"The result however of Kant's view of cognition suggests a second remark
- EnL",77
14041,"The philosophy of Kant could have no influence on the method of the sciences
- EnL",82
14042,"It leaves the categories and method of ordinary knowledge quite unmolested
- EnL",80
14044,"But when Empiricism becomes reflective and logically consistent, it turns its arms against this dualism in the ultimate and highest species of fact; it denies the independence of the thinking principle and of a spiritual world which developes itself in thought
- EnL",266
14045,"Materialism or Naturalism, therefore, is the consistent and thorough-going system of Empiricism
- EnL",101
14046,"In direct opposition to such an Empiricism, Kant asserts the principle of thought and freedom, and attaches himself to the first-mentioned form of empirical doctrine, the general principles of which he never departed from
- EnL",227
14047,"There is a dualism in his philosophy also
- EnL",47
14048,"On one side stands the world of sensation, and of the understanding which reflects upon it
- EnL",96
14049,"This world, it is true, he alleges to be a world of appearances
- EnL",69
14050,"But that is only a title or formal description; for the source, the facts, and the modes of observation continue quite the same as in Empiricism
- EnL",150
14051,"On the other side and independent stands a self-apprehending thought, the principle of freedom, which Kant has in common with ordinary and bygone metaphysic, but emptied of all that it held, and without his being able to infuse into it anything new
- EnL",254
14052,"For, in the Critical doctrine, thought, or, as it is there called, Reason, is divested of every specific form, and thus bereft of all authority
- EnL",149
14053,"The main effect of the Kantian philosophy has been to revive the consciousness of Reason, or the absolute inwardness of thought
- EnL",133
14055,"Henceforth the principle of the independence of Reason, or of its absolute self-subsistence, is made a general principle of philosophy, as well as a foregone conclusion of the time
- EnL",186
14056,"It has brought home the conviction that the categories of understanding are finite in their range, and that any cognitive process confined within their pale falls short of the truth
- EnL",187
14057,"But Kant had only a sight of half the truth
- EnL",49
14058,"He explained the finite nature of the categories to mean that they were subjective only, valid only for our thought, from which the thing-in-itself was divided by an impassable gulf
- EnL",187
14059,"In fact, however, it is not because they are subjective, that the categories are finite: they are finite by their very nature, and it is on their own selves that it is requisite to exhibit their finitude
- EnL",209
14060,"Kant however holds that what we think is false, because it is we who think it
- EnL",83
14061,"A further deficiency in the system is that it gives only an historical description of thought, and a mere enumeration of the factors of consciousness
- EnL",155
14062,"The enumeration is in the main correct: but not a word touches upon the necessity of what is thus empirically colligated
- EnL",126
14063,"The observations, made on the various stages of consciousness, culminate in the summary statement, that the content of all we are acquainted with is only an appearance
- EnL",173
14064,"And as it is true at least that all finite thinking is concerned with appearances, so far the conclusion is justified
- EnL",123
14065,"This stage of 'appearance' however--the phenomenal world--is not the terminus of thought: there is another and a higher region
- EnL",132
14066,"But that region was to the Kantian philosophy an inaccessible 'other world'
- EnL",81
14067,"Into details of the manner and the extent of this self-determination of thought, Kant never went
- EnL",102
14068,"It was Fichte who first noticed the omission; and who, after he had called attention to the want of a deduction for the categories, endeavoured really to supply something of the kind
- EnL",188
14069,"With Fichte, the 'Ego' is the starting-point in the philosophical development: and the outcome of its action is supposed to be visible in the categories
- EnL",158
14070,"But in Fichte the 'Ego' is not really presented as a free, spontaneous energy; it is supposed to receive its first excitation by a shock or impulse from without
- EnL",166
14071,"Against this shock the 'Ego' will, it is assumed, react, and only through this reaction does it first become conscious of itself
- EnL",134
14072,"Meanwhile, the nature of the impulse remains a stranger beyond our pale: and the 'Ego,' with something else always confronting it, is weighted with a condition
- EnL",165
14073,"Fichte, in consequence, never advanced beyond Kant's conclusion, that the finite only is knowable, while the infinite transcends the range of thought
- EnL",155
14074,"What Kant calls the thing-by-itself, Fichte calls the impulse from without--that abstraction of something else than 'I,' not otherwise describable or definable than as the negative or non-Ego in general
- EnL",208
14075,"The 'I' is thus looked at as standing in essential relation with the not-I, through which its act of self-determination is first awakened
- EnL",143
14076,"And in this manner the 'I' is but the continuous act of self-liberation from this impulse, never gaining a real freedom, because with the surcease of the impulse the 'I,' whose being is its action, would also cease to be
- EnL",226
14077,"Nor is the content produced by the action of the 'I' at all different from the ordinary content of experience, except by the supplementary remark, that this content is mere appearance
- EnL",189
14078,"In § 8 it is argued that a law of rhythm must be (1) objective, (a) formal, and (3) determined à priori
- EnL",109
14079,"With these requirements and with the principles of Causality and Reciprocity which follow later, it were well to compare the treatment of the various measures, upon which those formal principles do not exercise the slightest influence
- EnL",240
14080,"It cannot be deduced from any data of experience as a theoretical criterion of nature, nor can it be applied to know nature
- EnL",129
14081,"No employment of this notion is possible except solely for the practical reason, by moral laws
- EnL",100
14082,"The final purpose of the Creation is that constitution of the world which harmonises with that to which alone we can give definite expression on universal principles, viz the final purpose of our pure practical reason, and with that in so far as it means to be practical'
- EnL",277
14083,"Immediate or Intuitive Knowledge
- EnL",38
14084,"If we are to believe the Critical philosophy, thought is subjective, and its ultimate and invincible mode is abstract universality or formal identity
- EnL",155
14085,"Thought is thus set in opposition to Truth, which is no abstraction, but concrete universality
- EnL",100
14086,"In this highest mode of thought, which is entitled Reason, the Categories are left out of account--The extreme theory on the opposite side holds thought to be an act of the particular only, and on that ground declares it incapable of apprehending the Truth
- EnL",262
14087,"This is the Intuitional theory
- EnL",36
14088,"According to this theory, thinking, a private and particular operation, has its whole scope and product in the Categories
- EnL",127
14089,"But, these Categories, as arrested by the understanding, are limited vehicles of thought, forms of the conditioned, of the dependent and derivative
- EnL",153
14090,"A thought limited to these modes has no sense of the Infinite and the True, and cannot bridge over the gulf that separates it from them
- EnL",141
14091,"These inadequate modes or categories are also spoken of as notions: and to get a notion of an object therefore can only mean, in this language, to grasp it under the form of being conditioned and derivative
- EnL",212
14092,"Consequently, if the object in question be the True, the Infinite, the Unconditioned, we change it by our notions into a finite and conditioned; whereby, instead of apprehending the truth by thought, we have perverted it into untruth
- EnL",239
14093,"Such is the one simple line of argument advanced for the thesis that the knowledge of God and of truth must be immediate, or intuitive
- EnL",140
14094,"At an earlier period all sort of anthropomorphic conceptions, as they are termed, were banished from God, as being finite and therefore unworthy of the infinite; and in this way God had been reduced to a tolerably blank being
- EnL",231
14095,"But in those days the thought-forms were in general not supposed to come under the head of anthropomorphism
- EnL",113
14096,"Thought was believed rather to strip finitude from the conceptions of the Absolute,--in agreement with the above-mentioned conviction of all ages, that reflection is the only road to truth
- EnL",194
14097,"But now, at length, even the thought-forms are pronounced anthropomorphic, and thought itself is described as a mere faculty of finitisation
- EnL",146
14098,"Jacobi has stated this charge most distinctly in the seventh supplement to his Letters on Spinoza,--borrowing his line of argument from the works of Spinoza himself, and applying it as a weapon against knowledge in general
- EnL",228
14099,"In his attack knowledge is taken to mean knowledge of the finite only, a process of thought from one condition in a series to another, each of which is at once conditioning and conditioned
- EnL",194
14100,"According to such a view, to explain and to get the notion of anything, is the same as to show it to be derived from something else
- EnL",137
14101,"What Jacobi chiefly had before his eyes, when he thus described science, was the brilliant successes of the physical or 'exact' sciences in ascertaining natural forces and laws
- EnL",182
14102,"It is certainly not on the finite ground occupied by these sciences that we can expect to meet the in-dwelling presence of the infinite
- EnL",141
14103,"Lalande was right when he said he had swept the whole heaven with his glass, and seen no God
- EnL",98
14105,"All the while the doctrine that truth exists for the mind was so strongly maintained by Jacobi, that Reason alone is declared to be that by which man lives
- EnL",161
14106,"This Reason is the knowledge of God
- EnL",41
14107,"But, seeing that derivative knowledge is restricted to the compass of finite facts, Reason is knowledge underivative, or Faith
- EnL",132
14108,"Knowledge, Faith, Thought, Intuition are the categories that we meet with on this line of reflection
- EnL",106
14110,"Thus, we often find knowledge contrasted with faith, and faith at the same time explained to be an underivative or intuitive knowledge:--so that it must be at least some sort of knowledge
- EnL",193
14111,"And, besides, it is unquestionably a fact of experience, firstly, that what we believe is in our consciousness,---which implies that we know about it; and secondly, that this belief is a certainty in our consciousness,--which implies that we know it
- EnL",255
14112,"Again, and especially, we find thought opposed to immediate knowledge and faith, and, in particular, to intuition
- EnL",119
14113,"But if this intuition be qualified as intellectual, we must really mean intuition which thinks, unless, in a question about the nature of God, we are willing to interpret intellect to mean images and representations of imagination
- EnL",236
14114,"The word faith or belief, in the dialect of this system, comes to be employed even with reference to common objects that are present to the senses
- EnL",152
14115,"We believe, says Jacobi, that we have a body,--we believe in the existence of the things of sense
- EnL",103
14118,"Such personality is a thought, and falls within the province of thought only
- EnL",82
14119,"Pure and simple intuition is completely the same as pure and simple thought
- EnL",81
14120,"Intuition and belief, in the first instance, denote the definite conceptions we attach to these words in our ordinary employment of them: and to this extent they differ from thought in certain points which nearly every one can understand
- EnL",243
14121,"But here they are taken in a higher sense, and must be interpreted to mean a belief in God, or an intellectual intuition of God; in short, we must put aside all that especially distinguishes thought on the one side from belief and intuition on the other
- EnL",259
14122,"How belief and intuition, when transferred to these higher regions, differ from thought, it is impossible for any one to say
- EnL",130
14123,"And yet, such are the barren distinctions of words, with which men fancy that they assert an important truth: even while the formulae they maintain are identical with those which they impugn
- EnL",196
14125,"But we must not let ourselves be deceived by the semblance surreptitiously secured by a merely verbal similarity
- EnL",118
14126,"The two things are radically distinct
- EnL",43
14127,"Firstly, the Christian faith comprises in it an authority of the Church: but the faith of Jacobi's philosophy has no other authority than that of a personal revelation
- EnL",173
14130,"All these forms agree in adopting as their leading principle the immediacy, or self-evident way, in which a fact or body of truths is presented in consciousness
- EnL",166
14131,"This immediate knowledge consists in knowing that the Infinite, the Eternal, the God which is in our idea, really is: or, it asserts that in our consciousness there is immediately and inseparably bound up with this idea the certainty of its actual being
- EnL",259
14132,"To seek to controvert these maxims of immediate knowledge is the last thing philosophers would think of
- EnL",109
14133,"They may rather find occasion for self-gratulation when these ancient doctrines, expressing as they do the general tenor of philosophic teaching, have, even in this unphilosophical fashion, become to some extent universal convictions of the age
- EnL",250
14134,"The true marvel rather is that any one could suppose that these principles were opposed to philosophy,--the maxims, viz, that whatever is held to be true is immanent in the mind, and that there is truth for the mind (§ 63)
- EnL",228
14135,"From a formal point of view, there is a peculiar interest in the maxim that the being of God is immediately and inseparably bound up with the thought of God, that objectivity is bound up with the subjectivity which the thought originally presents
- EnL",252
14137,"Now it is the endeavour of philosophy to prove such a unity, to show that it lies in the very nature of thought and subjectivity, to be inseparable from being and objectivity
- EnL",180
14138,"In these circumstances therefore, philosophy, whatever estimate may be formed of the character of these proofs, must in any case be glad to see it shown and maintained that its maxims are facts of consciousness, and thus in harmony with experience
- EnL",253
14139,"The difference between philosophy and the asseverations of immediate knowledge rather centres in the exclusive attitude which immediate knowledge adopts, when it sets itself up against philosophy
- EnL",201
14140,"And yet it was as a self-evident or immediate truth that the 'Cogito, ergo sum,' of Descartes, the maxim on which may be said to hinge the whole interest of Modern Philosophy, was first stated by its author
- EnL",212
14141,"The man who calls this a syllogism, must know little more about a syllogism than that the word 'Ergo' occurs in it
- EnL",120
14142,"And a middle term is a much more essential point of a syllogism than the word 'Ergo'
- EnL",90
14143,"If we try to justify the name, by calling the combination of ideas in Descartes an 'immediate' syllogism, this superfluous variety of syllogism is a mere name for an utterly unmediated synthesis of distinct terms of thought
- EnL",229
14144,"That being so, the synthesis of being with our ideas, as stated in the maxim of immediate knowledge, has no more and no less claim to the title of syllogism than the axiom of Descartes has
- EnL",194
14145,"From Hotho's 'Dissertation on the Cartesian Philosophy' (published 1826), I borrow the quotation in which Descartes himself distinctly declares that the maxim 'Cogito, ergo sum,' is no syllogism
- EnL",200
14146,"The passages are Respons
- EnL",30
14147,"From the first passage I quote the words more immediately to the point
- EnL",76
14149,"Descartes knew what it implied in a syllogism, and so he adds that, in order to make the maxim admit of a deduction by syllogism, we should have to add the major premiss: 'Illud omne quod cogitat, est sive existit'
- EnL",220
14150,"Of course, he remarks, this major premiss itself has to be deduced from the original statement
- EnL",100
14152,"The theory of which we are speaking is not satisfied when it has shown that mediate knowledge taken separately is an adequate vehicle of truth
- EnL",148
14153,"Its distinctive doctrine is that immediate knowledge alone, to the total exclusion of mediation, can possess a content which is true
- EnL",138
14154,"This exclusiveness is enough to show that the theory is a relapse into the metaphysical understanding, with its pass-words 'Either--or'
- EnL",141
14155,"And thus it is really a relapse into the habit of external mediation, the gist of which consists in clinging to those narrow and one-sided categories of the finite, which it falsely imagined itself to have left for ever behind
- EnL",232
14156,"This point, however, we shall not at present discuss in detail
- EnL",68
14157,"An exclusively immediate knowledge is asserted as a fact only, and in the present Introduction we can only study it from this external point of view
- EnL",154
14158,"The real significance of such knowledge will be explained, when we come to the logical question of the opposition between mediate and immediate
- EnL",149
14159,"But it is characteristic of the view before us to decline to examine the nature of the fact, that is, the notion of it; for such an examination would itself be a step towards mediation and even towards knowledge
- EnL",217
14160,"The genuine discussion on logical ground, therefore, must be deferred till we come to the proper province of Logic itself
- EnL",127
14161,"The whole of the second part of Logic, the Doctrine of Essential Being, is a discussion of the intrinsic and self-affirming unity of immediacy and mediation
- EnL",162
14162,"Beyond this point then we need not go: immediate knowledge is to be accepted as a fact
- EnL",92
14163,"Under these circumstances examination is directed to the field of experience, to a psychological phenomenon
- EnL",113
14164,"If that be so, we need only note, as the commonest of experiences, that truths, which we well know to be results of complicated and highly mediated trains of thought, present themselves immediately and without effort to the mind of any man who is familiar with the subject
- EnL",278
14166,"The facility we attain in any sort of knowledge, art, or technical expertness, consists in having the particular knowledge or kind of action present to our mind in any case that occurs, even we may say, immediate in our very limbs, in an out-going activity
- EnL",262
14167,"In all these instances, immediacy of knowledge is so far from excluding mediation, that the two things are linked together,--immediate knowledge being actually the product and result of mediated knowledge
- EnL",210
14168,"It is no less obvious that immediate existence is bound up with its mediation
- EnL",83
14169,"The seed and the parents are immediate and initial existences in respect of the off-spring which they generate
- EnL",116
14170,"But the seed and the parents, though they exist and are therefore immediate, are yet in their turn generated: and the child, without prejudice to the mediation of its existence, is immediate, because it is
- EnL",211
14171,"The fact that I am in Berlin, my immediate presence here, is mediated by my having made the journey hither
- EnL",112
14173,"It is a matter of general experience that education or development is required to bring out into consciousness what is therein contained
- EnL",142
14174,"It was so even with the Platonic reminiscence; and the Christian rite of baptism, although a sacrament, involves the additional obligation of a Christian up-bringing
- EnL",171
14175,"In short, religion and morals, however much they may be faith or immediate knowledge, are still on every side conditioned by the mediating process which is termed development, education, training
- EnL",201
14176,"The adherents, no less than the assailants, of the doctrine of Innate Ideas have been guilty throughout of the like exclusiveness and narrowness as is here noted
- EnL",167
14178,"All men, it was said, must have these ideas; they must have, for example, the maxim of contradiction, present in the mind,--they must be aware of it; for this maxim and others like it were included in the class of Innate ideas
- EnL",232
14179,"The objection may be set down to misconception; for the principles in question, though innate, need not on that account have the form of ideas or conceptions of something we are aware of
- EnL",192
14180,"Still, the objection completely meets and overthrows the crude theory of immediate knowledge, which expressly maintains its formulae in so far as they are in consciousness--Another point calls for notice
- EnL",209
14181,"We may suppose it admitted by the intuitive school, that the special case of religious faith involves supplementing by a Christian or religious education and development
- EnL",175
14182,"In that case it is acting capriciously when it seeks to ignore this admission when speaking about faith, or it betrays a want of reflection not to know, that, if the necessity of education be once admitted, mediation is pronounced indispensable
- EnL",250
14183,"The reminiscence of ideas spoken of by Plato is equivalent to     saying that ideas implicitly exist in man, instead of being, as     the Sophists assert, a foreign importation into his mind
- EnL",196
14184,"But to     conceive knowledge as reminiscence does not interfere with, or     set aside as useless, the development of what is implicitly in     man;--which development is another word for mediation
- EnL",204
14185,"The same     holds good of the innate ideas that we find in Descartes and the     Scotch philosophers
- EnL",107
14186,"These ideas are only potential in the first     instance, and should be looked at as being a sort of mere capacity     in man
- EnL",131
14187,"In the case of these experiences the appeal turns upon something that shows itself bound up with immediate consciousness
- EnL",126
14188,"Even if this combination be in the first instance taken as an external and empirical connexion, still, even for empirical observation, the fact of its being constant shows it to be essential and inseparable
- EnL",212
14190,"It is apparent, therefore, that, though faith may be an immediate knowledge and certainty, it equally implies the interposition of this process as its antecedent and condition
- EnL",181
14191,"It has been already observed, that the so-called proofs of the being of God, which start from finite being, give an expression to this exaltation
- EnL",151
14192,"In that light they are no inventions of an over-subtle reflection, but the necessary and native channel in which the movement of mind runs: though it may be that, in their ordinary form, these proofs have not their correct and adequate expression
- EnL",252
14193,"It is the passage (§ 64) from the subjective Idea to being which forms the main concern of the doctrine of immediate knowledge
- EnL",132
14194,"A primary and self-evident inter-connexion is declared to exist between our Idea and being
- EnL",96
14195,"Yet precisely this central point of transition, utterly irrespective of any connexions which show in experience, clearly involves a mediation
- EnL",147
14196,"And the mediation is of no imperfect or unreal kind, where the mediation takes place with and through something external, but one comprehending both antecedent and conclusion
- EnL",180
14197,"For, what this theory asserts is that truth lies neither in the Idea as a merely subjective thought, nor in mere being on its own account;--that mere being per se, a being that is not of the Idea, is the sensible finite being of the world
- EnL",244
14198,"Now all this only affirms, without demonstration, that the Idea has truth only by means of being, and being has truth only by means of the Idea
- EnL",149
14199,"The maxim of immediate knowledge rejects an indefinite empty immediacy (and such is abstract being, or pure unity taken by itself), and affirms in its stead the unity of the Idea with being
- EnL",195
14200,"And it acts rightly in so doing
- EnL",37
14202,"That the quality of mediation is involved in the very immediacy of intuition is thus exhibited as a fact, against which understanding, conformably to the fundamental maxim of immediate knowledge that the evidence of consciousness is infallible, can have nothing to object
- EnL",277
14203,"It is only ordinary abstract understanding which takes the terms of mediation and immediacy, each by itself absolutely, to represent an inflexible line of distinction, and thus draws upon its own head the hopeless task of reconciling them
- EnL",244
14204,"The difficulty, as we have shown, has no existence in the fact, and it vanishes in the speculative notion
- EnL",111
14205,"The one-sidedness of the intuitional school has certain characteristics attending upon it, which we shall proceed to point out in their main features, now that we have discussed the fundamental principle
- EnL",209
14206,"The first of these corollaries is as follows
- EnL",50
14207,"Since the criterion of truth is found, not in the nature of the content, but in the mere fact of consciousness, every alleged truth has no other basis than subjective certitude and the assertion that we discover a certain fact in our consciousness
- EnL",253
14208,"What I discover in my consciousness is thus exaggerated into a fact of the consciousness of all, and even passed off for the very nature of consciousness
- EnL",159
14209,"Among the so-called proofs of the existence of God, there used to stand the consensus gentium, to which appeal is made as early as Cicero
- EnL",143
14210,"The consensus gentium is a weighty authority, and the transition is easy and natural, from the circumstance that a certain fact is found in the consciousness of every one, to the conclusion that it is a necessary element in the very nature of consciousness
- EnL",262
14211,"In this category of general agreement there was latent the deep-rooted perception, which does not escape even the least cultivated mind, that the consciousness of the individual is at the same time particular and accidental
- EnL",229
14213,"Of course, if thought insists on seeing the necessity of what is presented as a fact of general occurrence, the consensus gentium is certainly not sufficient
- EnL",163
14215,"A second corollary which results from holding immediacy of consciousness to be the criterion of truth is that all superstition or idolatry is allowed to be truth, and that an apology is prepared for any contents of the will, however wrong and immoral
- EnL",256
14216,"It is because he believes in them, and not from the reasoning and syllogism of what is termed mediate knowledge, that the Hindoo finds God in the cow, the monkey, the Brahmin, or the Lama
- EnL",193
14218,"Thirdly and lastly, the immediate consciousness of God goes no further than to tell us that He is: to tell us what He is, would be an act of cognition, involving mediation
- EnL",177
14219,"So that God as an object of religion is expressly narrowed down to the indeterminate supersensible, God in general: and the significance of religion is reduced to a minimum
- EnL",178
14221,"We have still briefly to indicate the general nature of the form of immediacy
- EnL",83
14222,"For it is the essential one-sidedness of the category, which makes whatever comes under it one sided and, for that reason, finite
- EnL",135
14223,"And, first, it makes the universal no better than an abstraction external to the particulars, and God a being without determinate quality
- EnL",143
14224,"But God can only be called a spirit when He is known to be at once the beginning and end, as well as the mean, in the process of mediation
- EnL",144
14225,"Without this unification of elements He is neither concrete, nor living, nor a spirit
- EnL",91
14226,"Thus the knowledge of God as a spirit necessarily implies mediation
- EnL",73
14227,"The form of immediacy, secondly, invests the particular with the character of independent or self-centred being
- EnL",117
14228,"But such predicates contradict the very essence of the particular,--which is to be referred to something else outside
- EnL",123
14229,"They thus invest the finite with the character of an absolute
- EnL",67
14230,"But, besides, the form of immediacy is altogether abstract: it has no preference for one set of contents more than another, but is equally susceptible of all: it may as well sanction what is idolatrous and immoral as the reverse
- EnL",234
14231,"Only when we discern that the content,--the particular, is not self-subsistent, but derivative from something else, are its finitude and untruth shown in their proper light
- EnL",178
14232,"Such discernment, where the content we discern carries with it the ground of its dependent nature, is a knowledge which involves mediation
- EnL",144
14233,"The only content which can be held to be the truth is one not mediated with something else, not limited by other things: or, otherwise expressed, it is one mediated by itself, where mediation and immediate reference-to-self coincide
- EnL",238
14235,"Abstract thought (the scientific form used by 'reflective' metaphysic) and abstract intuition (the form used by immediate knowledge) are one and the same
- EnL",159
14236,"The stereotyped opposition between the form of immediacy and that     of mediation gives to the former a halfness and inadequacy, that     affects every content which is brought under it
- EnL",192
14237,"Immediacy means,     upon the whole, an abstract reference-to-self, that is, an abstract     identity or abstract universality
- EnL",132
14238,"Accordingly the essential and     real universal, when taken merely in its immediacy, is a mere     abstract universal; and from this point of view God is conceived     as a being altogether without determinate quality
- EnL",224
14239,"To call God     spirit is in that case only a phrase: for the consciousness and     self-consciousness, which spirit implies, are impossible without a     distinguishing of it from itself and from something else, ie     without mediation
- EnL",243
14240,"It was impossible for us to criticise this, the third attitude, which thought has been made to take towards objective truth, in any other mode than what is naturally indicated and admitted in the doctrine itself
- EnL",217
14241,"The theory asserts that immediate knowledge is a fact
- EnL",59
14242,"It has been shown to be untrue in fact to say that there is an immediate knowledge, a knowledge without mediation either by means of something else or in itself
- EnL",166
14243,"It has also been explained to be false in fact to say that thought advances through finite and conditioned categories only, which are always mediated by a something else, and to forget that in the very act of mediation the mediation itself vanishes
- EnL",254
14244,"And to show that, in point of fact, there is a knowledge which advances neither by unmixed immediacy nor by unmixed mediation, we can point to the example of Logic and the whole of philosophy
- EnL",197
14245,"If we view the maxims of immediate knowledge in connexion with the uncritical metaphysic of the past from which we started, we shall learn from the comparison the reactionary nature of the school of Jacobi
- EnL",211
14246,"His doctrine is a return to the modern starting-point of this metaphysic in the Cartesian philosophy
- EnL",106
14247,"Both Jacobi and Descartes maintain the following three points:  (1) The simple inseparability of the thought and being of the thinker
- EnL",139
14248,"This inseparability is the absolutely first and most certain knowledge, not mediated or demonstrated
- EnL",106
14249,"By this nothing more is meant than sense-consciousness
- EnL",60
14251,"There is however a distinction between the two points of view:  (1) The Cartesian philosophy, from these unproved postulates, which it assumes to be unprovable, proceeds to wider and wider details of knowledge, and thus gave rise to the sciences of modern times
- EnL",267
14253,"But, on the other hand, when it comes to the science which has infinity for its scope, it throws aside that method, and thus, as it knows no other, it rejects all methods
- EnL",176
14254,"It abandons itself to wild vagaries of imagination and assertion, to a moral priggishness and sentimental arrogance, or to a reckless dogmatising and lust of argument, which is loudest against philosophy and philosophic doctrines
- EnL",235
14255,"Philosophy of course tolerates no mere assertions or conceits, and checks the free play of argumentative see-saw
- EnL",118
14256,"We must then reject the opposition between an independent immediacy in the contents or facts of consciousness and an equally independent mediation, supposed incompatible with the former
- EnL",191
14257,"The incompatibility is a mere assumption, an arbitrary assertion
- EnL",70
14258,"All other assumptions and postulates must in like manner be left behind at the entrance to philosophy, whether they are derived from the intellect or the imagination
- EnL",171
14259,"For philosophy is the science, in which every such proposition must first be scrutinised and its meaning and oppositions be ascertained
- EnL",141
14260,"Scepticism, made a negative science and systematically applied to all forms of knowledge, might seem a suitable introduction, as pointing out the nullity of such assumptions
- EnL",179
14261,"But a sceptical introduction would be not only an ungrateful but also a useless course; and that because Dialectic, as we shall soon make appear, is itself an essential element of affirmative science
- EnL",205
14262,"Scepticism, besides, could only get hold of the finite forms as they were suggested by experience, taking them as given, instead of deducing them scientifically
- EnL",166
14263,"To require such a scepticism accomplished is the same as to insist on science being preceded by universal doubt, or a total absence of presupposition
- EnL",155
14264,"Strictly speaking, in the resolve that wills pure thought, this requirement is accomplished by freedom which, abstracting from everything, grasps its pure abstraction, the simplicity of thought
- EnL",199
14265,"The Christian world would certainly refuse the title of God to the idols of the Hindoos and the Chinese, to the fetiches of the Africans, and even to the gods of Greece themselves
- EnL",185
14266,"If so, a believer in these idols would not be a believer in God
- EnL",69
14267,"If it were contended, on the other hand, that such a belief in idols implies some sort of belief in God, as the species implies the genus, then idolatry would argue not faith in an idol merely, but faith in God
- EnL",216
14268,"The Athenians took an opposite view
- EnL",41
14269,"The poets and philosophers who explained Zeus to be a cloud, and maintained that there was only one God, were treated as atheists at Athens
- EnL",145
14270,"The danger in these questions lies in looking at what the mind may make out of an object, and not what that object actually and explicitly is
- EnL",147
14271,"If we fail to note this distinction, the commonest perceptions of men's senses will be religion: for every such perception, and indeed every act of mind, implicitly contains the principle which, when it is purified and developed, rises to religion
- EnL",253
14272,"But to be capable of religion is one thing, to have it another
- EnL",68
14273,"And religion yet implicit is only a capacity or a possibility
- EnL",67
14274,"Thus in modern times, travellers have found tribes (as Captains Ross and Parry found the Esquimaux) which, as they tell us, have not even that small modicum of religion possessed by African sorcerers, the goëtes of Herodotus
- EnL",230
14275,"On the other hand, an Englishman, who spent the first months of the last Jubilee at Rome, says, in his account of the modern Romans, that the common people are bigots, whilst those who can read and write are atheists to a man
- EnL",231
14276,"The charge of Atheism is seldom heard in modern times: principally because the facts and the requirements of religion are reduced to a minimum
- EnL",148
14277,"He will see that that idea exhibits a true and unchangeable nature,--a nature which cannot but exist, since necessary existence is contained in it)
- EnL",153
14278,"A remark which immediately follows, and which sounds like mediation or demonstration, does not really prejudice the original principle
- EnL",140
14279,"In Spinoza we come upon the same statement that the essence or abstract conception of God implies existence
- EnL",113
14281,"The inseparability of the notion from being is the main point and fundamental hypothesis in his system
- EnL",108
14282,"But what notion is thus inseparable from being?
- EnL",53
14283,"Not the notion of finite things, for they are so constituted as to have a contingent and a created existence
- EnL",114
14284,"Spinoza's 11th proposition, which follows with a proof that God exists necessarily, and his 20th, showing that God's existence and his essence are one and the same, are really superfluous, and the proof is more in form than in reality
- EnL",240
14285,"To say, that God is Substance, the only Substance, and that, as Substance is Causa Sui, God therefore exists necessarily, is merely stating that God is that of which the notion and the being are inseparable
- EnL",212
14286,"These words of Anselm, in connexion with the concrete truths of Christian doctrine, offer a far harder problem for investigation, than is contemplated by this modern faith
- EnL",177
14287,"In point of form Logical doctrine has three sides: (α) the Abstract side, or that of understanding: (ß) the Dialectical, or that of negative reason: (y) the Speculative, or that of positive reason
- EnL",202
14288,"These three sides do not make three parts of logic, but are stages or 'moments' in every logical entity, that is, of every notion and truth whatever
- EnL",154
14290,"In our ordinary usage of the term thought and even notion, we often have before our eyes nothing more than the operation of Understanding
- EnL",143
14291,"And no doubt thought is primarily an exercise of Understanding:--only it goes further, and the notion is not a function of Understanding merely
- EnL",149
14292,"The action of Understanding may be in general described as investing its subject-matter with the form of universality
- EnL",123
14293,"But this universal is an abstract universal: that is to say, its opposition to the particular is so rigorously maintained, that it is at the same time also reduced to the character of a particular again
- EnL",208
14294,"In this separating and abstracting attitude towards its objects, Understanding is the reverse of immediate perception and sensation, which, as such, keep completely to their native sphere of action in the concrete
- EnL",219
14295,"It is by referring to this opposition of Understanding to sensation or feeling that we must explain the frequent attacks made upon thought for being hard and narrow, and for leading, if consistently developed, to ruinous and pernicious results
- EnL",249
14296,"The answer to these charges, in so far as they are warranted by their facts, is, that they do not touch thinking in general, certainly not the thinking of Reason, but only the exercise of Understanding
- EnL",207
14297,"It must be added however, that the merit and rights of the mere Understanding should unhesitatingly be admitted
- EnL",117
14298,"And that merit lies in the fact, that apart from Understanding there is no fixity or accuracy in the region either of theory or of practice
- EnL",145
14299,"Thus, in theory, knowledge begins by apprehending existing objects in their specific differences
- EnL",102
14300,"In the study of nature, for example, we distinguish matters, forces, genera and the like, and stereotype each in its isolation
- EnL",132
14301,"Thought is here acting in its analytic capacity, where its canon is identity, a simple reference of each attribute to itself
- EnL",130
14302,"It is under the guidance of the same identity that the process in knowledge is effected from one scientific truth to another
- EnL",130
14303,"Thus, for example, in mathematics magnitude is the feature which, to the neglect of any other, determines our advance
- EnL",123
14304,"Hence in geometry we compare one figure with another, so as to bring out their identity
- EnL",93
14305,"Similarly in other fields of knowledge, such as jurisprudence, the advance is primarily regulated by identity
- EnL",115
14306,"In it we argue from one specific law or precedent to another: and what is this but to proceed on the principle of identity?
- EnL",129
14307,"But Understanding is as indispensable in practice as it is in theory
- EnL",74
14308,"Character is an essential in conduct, and a man of character is an understanding man, who in that capacity has definite ends in view and undeviatingly pursues them

14309,"The man who will do something great must learn, as Goethe says, to limit himself

14310,"The man who, on the contrary, would do everything, really would do nothing, and fails

14311,"There is a host of interesting things in the world: Spanish poetry, chemistry, politics, and music are all very interesting, and if any one takes an interest in them we need not find fault
- EnL",194
14312,"But for a person in a given situation to accomplish anything, he must stick to one definite point, and not dissipate his' forces in many directions
- EnL",153
14313,"In every calling, too, the great thing is to pursue it with understanding
- EnL",79
14314,"Thus the judge must stick to the law, and give his verdict in accordance with, it, undeterred by one motive or another, allowing no excuses; and looking neither left nor right
- EnL",181
14315,"Understanding, too, is always an element in thorough training
- EnL",67
14317,"It has been already explained that the Logical principle in general, far from being merely a subjective action in our minds, is rather the very universal, which as such is also objective
- EnL",192
14318,"This doctrine is illustrated in the case of understanding, the first form of logical truths
- EnL",97
14319,"Understanding in this larger sense corresponds to what we call the goodness of God, so far as that means that finite things are and subsist
- EnL",145
14320,"In nature, for example, we recognise the goodness of God in the fact that the various classes or species of animals and plants are provided with whatever they need for their preservation and welfare
- EnL",204
14321,"Nor is man excepted, who, both as an individual and as a nation, possesses partly in the given circumstances of climate, of quality and products of soil, and partly in his natural parts or talents, all that is required for his maintenance and development
- EnL",260
14322,"Under this shape Understanding is visible in every department of the objective world; and no object in that world can ever be wholly perfect which does not give full satisfaction to the canons of understanding
- EnL",215
14324,"This particularly holds good of Art, Religion, and Philosophy
- EnL",67
14325,"In Art, for example, understanding is visible where the forms of beauty, which differ in principle, are kept distinct and exhibited in their purity
- EnL",153
14326,"The same thing holds good also of single works of art
- EnL",59
14327,"It is part of the beauty and perfection of a dramatic poem that the characters of the several persons should be closely and faithfully maintained, and that the different aims and interests involved should be plainly and decidedly exhibited
- EnL",245
14328,"Or again, take the province of Religion
- EnL",45
14330,"Lastly comes Philosophy
- EnL",29
14331,"That Philosophy never can get on without the understanding hardly calls for special remark after what has been said
- EnL",121
14332,"Its foremost requirement is that every thought shall be grasped in its full precision, and nothing allowed to remain vague and indefinite
- EnL",143
14333,"It is usually added that understanding must not go too far
- EnL",64
14334,"Which is so far correct, that understanding is not an ultimate, but on the contrary finite, and so constituted that when carried to extremes it veers round to its opposite
- EnL",177
14335,"It is the fashion of youth to dash about in abstractions: but the man who has learnt to know life steers clear of the abstract 'either--or,' and keeps to the concrete
- EnL",172
14336,"And in that light, the semblance is the nonentity, while the true reality is supposed to belong to the original dicta of understanding
- EnL",140
14337,"Often, indeed, Dialectic is nothing more than a subjective see-saw of arguments pro and con, where the absence of sterling thought is disguised by the subtlety which gives birth to such arguments
- EnL",201
14338,"But in its true and proper character
- EnL",42
14339,"Dialectic is the very nature and essence of everything predicated by mere understanding,--the law of things and of the finite as a whole
- EnL",142
14340,"Dialectic is different from 'Reflection'
- EnL",46
14341,"In the first instance, Reflection is that movement out beyond the isolated predicate of a thing which gives it some reference, and brings out its relativity, while still in other respects leaving it its isolated validity
- EnL",226
14342,"But by Dialectic is meant the in-dwelling tendency outwards by which the one-sidedness and limitation of the predicates of understanding is seen in its true light, and shown to be the negation of them
- EnL",206
14343,"For anything to be finite is just to suppress itself and put itself aside
- EnL",79
14345,"It is also the soul of all knowledge which is truly scientific
- EnL",68
14346,"In the popular way of looking at things, the refusal to be bound by the abstract deliverances of understanding appears as fairness, which, according to the proverb Live and let live, demands that each should have its turn; we admit the one, but we admit the other also
- EnL",274
14347,"But when we look more closely, we find that the limitations of the finite do not merely come from without; that its own nature is the cause of its abrogation, and that by its own act it passes into its counterpart
- EnL",219
14348,"But the true view of the matter is that life, as life, involves the germ of death, and that the finite, being radically self-contradictory, involves its own self-suppression
- EnL",179
14349,"Nor, again, is Dialectic to be confounded with mere Sophistry
- EnL",67
14350,"The essence of Sophistry lies in giving authority to a partial and abstract principle, in its isolation, as may suit the interest and particular situation of the individual at the time
- EnL",190
14351,"For example, a regard to my existence, and my having the means of existence, is a vital motive of conduct, but if I exclusively emphasise this consideration or motive of my welfare, and draw the conclusion that I may steal or betray my country, we have a case of Sophistry
- EnL",278
14352,"Similarly, it is a vital principle in conduct that I should be subjectively free, that is to say, that I should have an insight into what I am doing, and a conviction that it is right
- EnL",189
14353,"But if my pleading insists on this principle alone I fall into Sophistry, such as would overthrow all the principles of morality
- EnL",134
14354,"From this sort of party-pleading Dialectic is wholly different; its purpose is to study things in their own being and movement and thus to demonstrate the finitude of the partial categories of understanding
- EnL",212
14355,"Dialectic, it may be added, is no novelty in philosophy
- EnL",61
14356,"Among the ancients Plato is termed the inventor of Dialectic; and his right to the name rests on the fact, that the Platonic philosophy first gave the free scientific, and thus at the same time the objective, form to Dialectic
- EnL",232
14357,"Socrates, as we should expect from the general character of his philosophising, has the dialectical element in a predominantly subjective shape, that of Irony
- EnL",164
14358,"He used to turn his Dialectic, first against ordinary consciousness, and then especially against the Sophists
- EnL",115
14360,"If, for instance, the Sophists claimed to be teachers, Socrates by a series of questions forced the Sophist Protagoras to confess that all learning is only recollection
- EnL",174
14361,"In his more strictly scientific dialogues Plato employs the dialectical method to show the finitude of all hard and fast terms of understanding
- EnL",149
14362,"Thus in the Parmenides he deduces the many from the one, and shows nevertheless that the many cannot but define itself as the one
- EnL",135
14363,"In this grand style did Plato treat Dialectic
- EnL",51
14364,"In modern times it was, more than any other, Kant who resuscitated the name of Dialectic, and restored it to its post of honour
- EnL",133
14365,"He did it, as we have seen (§ 48), by working out the Antinomies of the reason
- EnL",84
14366,"The problem of these Antinomies is no mere subjective piece of work oscillating between one set of grounds and another; it really serves to show that every abstract proposition of understanding, taken precisely as it is given, naturally veers round into its opposite
- EnL",272
14367,"However reluctant Understanding may be to admit the action of Dialectic, we must not suppose that the recognition if its existence is peculiarly confined to the philosopher
- EnL",178
14368,"It would be truer to say that Dialectic gives expression to a law which is felt in all other grades of consciousness, and in general experience
- EnL",149
14369,"Everything that surrounds us may be viewed as an instance of Dialectic
- EnL",76
14371,"All things, we say,--that is, the finite world as such,--are doomed; and in saying so, we have a vision of Dialectic as the universal and irresistible power before which nothing can stay, however secure and stable it may deem itself
- EnL",238
14372,"The category of power does not, it is true, exhaust the depth of the divine nature or the notion of God; but it certainly forms a vital element in all religious consciousness
- EnL",180
14373,"Apart from this general objectivity of Dialectic, we find traces of its presence in each of the particular provinces and phases of the natural and the spiritual world
- EnL",172
14374,"Take as an illustration the motion of the heavenly bodies
- EnL",63
14375,"At this moment the planet stands in this spot, but implicitly it is the possibility of being in another spot; and that possibility of being otherwise the planet brings into existence by moving
- EnL",198
14376,"Similarly the 'physical' elements prove to be Dialectical
- EnL",63
14377,"The process of meteorological action is the exhibition of their Dialectic
- EnL",79
14378,"It is the same dynamic that lies at the root of every other natural process, and, as it were, forces nature out of itself
- EnL",127
14380,"Thus summum jus summa injuria: which means, that to drive an abstract right to its extremity is to do a wrong
- EnL",115
14381,"In political life, as every one knows, extreme anarchy and extreme despotism naturally lead to one another
- EnL",112
14382,"The perception of Dialectic in the province of individual Ethics is seen in the well-known adages, Pride comes before a fall: Too much wit outwits itself
- EnL",159
14383,"Even feeling, bodily as well as mental, has its Dialectic
- EnL",63
14384,"Every one knows how the extremes of pain and pleasure pass into each other: the heart overflowing with joy seeks relief in tears, and the deepest melancholy will at times betray its presence by a smile
- EnL",207
14385,"It would be more correct to say that the Sceptic has no doubt of his point, which is the nothingness of all finite existence
- EnL",130
14386,"He who only doubts still clings to the hope that his doubt may be resolved, and that one or other of the definite views, between which he wavers, will turn out solid and true
- EnL",180
14387,"Scepticism properly so called is a very different thing: it is complete hopelessness about all which understanding counts stable, and the feeling to which it gives birth is one of unbroken calmness and inward repose
- EnL",221
14388,"Such at least is the noble Scepticism of antiquity, especially as exhibited in the writings of Sextus Empiricus, when in the later times of Rome it had been systematised as a complement to the dogmatic systems of Stoic and Epicurean
- EnL",238
14389,"Of far other stamp, and to be strictly distinguished from it, is the modern Scepticism already mentioned § (39), which partly preceded the Critical Philosophy, and partly sprung out of it
- EnL",193
14390,"That later Scepticism consisted solely in denying the truth and certitude of the super-sensible, and in pointing to the facts of sense and of immediate sensations as what we have to keep to
- EnL",195
14391,"Even to this day Scepticism is often spoken of as the irresistible enemy of all positive knowledge, and hence of philosophy, in so far as philosophy is concerned with positive knowledge
- EnL",191
14392,"But in these statements there is a misconception
- EnL",54
14393,"It is only the finite thought of abstract understanding which has to fear Scepticism, because unable to withstand it: philosophy includes the sceptical principle as a subordinate function of its own, in the shape of Dialectic
- EnL",231
14394,"In contradistinction to mere Scepticism, however, philosophy does not remain content with the purely negative result of Dialectic
- EnL",135
14395,"The sceptic mistakes the true value of his result, when he supposes it to be no more than a negation pure and simple
- EnL",122
14396,"For the negative, which emerges as the result of dialectic, is, because a result, at the same time the positive: it contains what it results from, absorbed into itself, and made part of its own nature
- EnL",206
14397,"Thus conceived, however, the dialectical stage has the features characterising the third grade of logical truth, the speculative form, or form of positive reason
- EnL",167
14398,"Bare abstractions or formal thoughts are therefore no business of philosophy, which has to deal only with concrete thoughts
- EnL",129
14400,"The general mode by which experience first makes us aware of the reasonable order of things is by accepted and unreasoned belief; and the character of the rational, as already noted (§ 45), is to be unconditioned, and thus to be self-contained, self-determining
- EnL",267
14401,"In this sense man above all things becomes aware of the reasonable order, when he knows of God, and knows Him to be the completely self-determined
- EnL",152
14402,"Similarly, the consciousness a citizen has of his country and its laws is a perception of the reason-world, so long as he looks up to them as unconditioned and likewise universal powers, to which he must subject his individual will
- EnL",237
14403,"And in the same sense, the knowledge and will of the child is rational, when he knows his parents' will, and wills it
- EnL",123
14404,"Now, to turn these rational (of course positively-rational) realities into speculative principles, the only thing needed is that they be thought
- EnL",150
14405,"The expression 'Speculation' in common life is often used with a very vague and at the same time secondary sense, as when we speak of a matrimonial or a commercial speculation
- EnL",181
14407,"A certain theory of some conditions and circumstances of nature or mind may be, say these people, very fine and correct as a matter of speculation, but it contradicts experience and nothing of the sort is admissible in reality
- EnL",232
14409,"A one-sided proposition therefore can never even give expression to a speculative truth
- EnL",93
14411,"Speculative truth, it may also be noted, means very much the same as what, in special connexion with religious experience and doctrines, used to be called Mysticism
- EnL",170
14415,"But, as we have seen, the abstract thinking of understanding is so far from being either ultimate or stable, that it shows a perpetual tendency to work its own dissolution and swing round into its opposite
- EnL",211
14416,"Reasonableness, on the contrary, just, consists in embracing within itself these opposites as unsubstantial elements
- EnL",122
14417,"Thus the reason-world may be equally styled mystical,--not however because thought cannot both reach and comprehend it, but merely because it lies beyond the compass of understanding
- EnL",188
14418,"In its immediacy: the notion implicit and in germ
- EnL",55
14419,"In its reflection and mediation: the being-for-self and show of the notion
- EnL",80
14420,"In its return into itself, and its developed abiding by itself: the notion in and for itself
- EnL",98
14421,"The division of Logic now given, as well as the whole of the previous discussion on the nature of thought, is anticipatory: and the justification, or proof of it, can only result from the detailed treatment of thought itself
- EnL",230
14422,"For in philosophy, to prove means to show how the subject by and from itself makes itself what it is
- EnL",106
14423,"The relation in which these three leading grades of thought, or of the logical Idea, stand to each other must be conceived as follows
- EnL",139
14427,"Being is the notion implicit only: its special forms have the predicate 'is'; when they are distinguished they are each of them an 'other': and the shape which dialectic takes in them, ie their further specialisation, is a passing over into another
- EnL",254
14428,"This further determination, or specialisation, is at once a forth-putting and in that way a disengaging of the notion implicit in being; and at the same time the withdrawing of being inwards, its sinking deeper into itself
- EnL",228
14429,"Thus the explication of the notion in the sphere of being does two things: it brings out the totality of being, and it abolishes the immediacy of being, or the form of being as such
- EnL",187
14431,"For a metaphysical definition of God is the expression of His nature in thoughts as such: and logic embraces all thoughts so long as they continue in the thought-form
- EnL",172
14432,"The second sub-category in each triad, where the grade of thought is in its differentiation, gives, on the other hand, a definition of the finite
- EnL",151
14433,"The objection to the form of definition is that it implies a something in the mind's eye on which these predicates may fasten
- EnL",131
14435,"The thought, which is here the matter of sole importance, is contained only in the predicate: and hence the propositional form, like the said subject, viz the Absolute, is a mere superfluity (cf
- EnL",200
14436,"Each of the three spheres of the logical idea proves to be a systematic whole of thought-terms, and a phase of the Absolute
- EnL",129
14437,"This is the case with Being, containing the three grades of quality, quantity, and measure
- EnL",96
14438,"Quality is, in the first place, the character identical with being: so identical, that a thing ceases to be what it is, if it loses its quality
- EnL",149
14439,"Quantity, on the contrary, is the character external to being, and does not affect the being at all
- EnL",105
14440,"Thus eg a house remains what it is, whether it be greater or smaller; and red remains red, whether it be brighter or darker
- EnL",129
14441,"Measure, the third grade of being, which is the unity of the first two, is a qualitative quantity
- EnL",103
14442,"All things have their measure: ie the quantitative terms of their existence, their being so or so great, does not matter within certain limits; but when these limits are exceeded by an additional more or less, the things cease to be what they were
- EnL",253
14443,"From measure follows the advance to the second sub-division of the idea, Essence
- EnL",86
14444,"The three forms of being here mentioned, just because they are the first, are also the poorest, ie the most abstract
- EnL",122
14445,"Immediate (sensible) consciousness, in so far as it simultaneously includes an intellectual element, is especially restricted to the abstract categories of quality and quantity
- EnL",182
14446,"The sensuous consciousness is in ordinary estimation the most concrete and thus also the richest; but that is only true as regards materials, whereas, in reference to the thought it contains, it is really the poorest and most abstract
- EnL",240
14447,"Pure Being makes the beginning: because it is on one hand pure thought, and on the other immediacy itself, simple and indeterminate; and the first beginning cannot be mediated by anything, or be further determined
- EnL",219
14448,"All doubts and admonitions, which might be brought against beginning the science with abstract empty being, will disappear, if we only perceive what a beginning naturally implies
- EnL",184
14449,"It is possible to define being as 'I = I,' as 'Absolute Indifference' or Identity, and so on
- EnL",98
14450,"But each of these forms contains a mediation, and hence cannot be the real first: for all mediation implies advance made from a first on to a second, and proceeding from something different
- EnL",195
14451,"If I = I, or even the intellectual intuition, are really taken to mean no more than the first, they are in this mere immediacy identical with being: while conversely, pure being, if abstract no longer, but including in it mediation, is pure thought or intuition
- EnL",267
14452,"If we enunciate Being as a predicate of the Absolute, we get the first definition of the latter
- EnL",101
14453,"The Absolute is Being
- EnL",27
14454,"This is (in thought) the absolutely initial definition, the most abstract and stinted
- EnL",91
14455,"It is the definition given by the Eleatics, but at the same time is also the well-known definition of God as the sum of all realities
- EnL",139
14456,"It means, in short, that we are to set aside that limitation which is in every reality, so that God shall be only the real in all reality, the superlatively real
- EnL",167
14457,"Or, if we reject reality, as implying a reflection, we get a more immediate or unreflected statement of the same thing, when Jacobi says that the God of Spinoza is the principium of being in all existence
- EnL",210
14458,"The indeterminate, as we here have it, is the blank we begin with, not a featurelessness reached by abstraction, not the elimination of all character, but the original featurelessness which precedes all definite character and is the very first of all
- EnL",256
14459,"And this we call Being
- EnL",28
14460,"It is not to be felt, or perceived by sense, or pictured in imagination: it is only and merely thought, and as such it forms the beginning
- EnL",144
14461,"Essence also is indeterminate, but in another sense: it has traversed the process of mediation and contains implicit the determination it has absorbed
- EnL",156
14462,"As the logical Idea is seen to unfold itself in a process from the abstract to the concrete, so in the history of philosophy the earliest systems are the most abstract, and thus at the same time the poorest
- EnL",212
14463,"The relation too of the earlier to the later; systems of philosophy is much like the relation of the corresponding stages of the logical Idea: in other words, the earlier are preserved in the later; but subordinated and submerged
- EnL",235
14464,"This is the true meaning of a much misunderstood phenomenon in the history of philosophy--the refutation of one system by another, of an earlier by a later
- EnL",161
14465,"Most commonly the refutation is taken in a purely negative sense to mean that the system refuted has ceased to count for anything, has been set aside and done for
- EnL",168
14466,"Were it so, the history of philosophy would be of all studies most saddening, displaying, as it does, the refutation of every system which time has brought forth
- EnL",167
14467,"Now, although it may be admitted that every philosophy has been refuted, it must be in an equal degree maintained, that no philosophy has been refuted, nay, or can be refuted
- EnL",180
14468,"And that in two ways
- EnL",26
14469,"For first, every philosophy that deserves the name always embodies the Idea: and secondly, every system represents one particular factor or particular stage in the evolution of the Idea
- EnL",191
14470,"The refutation of a philosophy, therefore, only means that its barriers are crossed, and its special principle reduced to a factor in the completer principle that follows
- EnL",176
14471,"Thus the history of philosophy, in its true meaning, deals not with a past, but with an eternal and veritable present: and, in its results, resembles not a museum of the aberrations of the human intellect, but a Pantheon of Godlike figures
- EnL",245
14472,"These figures of Gods are the various stages of the Idea, as they come forward one after another in dialectical development
- EnL",129
14473,"To the historian of philosophy it belongs to point out more precisely, how far the gradual evolution of his theme coincides with, or swerves from, the dialectical unfolding of the pure logical Idea
- EnL",203
14474,"It is sufficient to mention here, that logic begins where the proper history of philosophy begins
- EnL",103
14475,"Philosophy began in the Eleatic school, especially with Parmenides
- EnL",72
14476,"Parmenides, who conceives the absolute as Being, says that 'Being alone is and Nothing is not'
- EnL",100
14477,"Such was the true starting-point of philosophy, which is always knowledge by thought: and here for the first time we find pure thought seized and made an object to itself
- EnL",176
14478,"Men indeed thought from the beginning: (for thus only were they distinguished from the animals)
- EnL",101
14479,"But thousands of years had to elapse before they came to apprehend thought in its purity, and to see in it the truly objective
- EnL",132
14480,"The Eleatics are celebrated as daring thinkers
- EnL",52
14481,"But this nominal admiration is often accompanied by the remark that they went too far, when they made Being alone true, and denied the truth of every other object of consciousness
- EnL",185
14482,"The true state of the case is rather as follows
- EnL",53
14483,"Being, as Being, is nothing fixed or ultimate: it yields to dialectic and sinks into its opposite, which, also taken immediately, is Nothing
- EnL",146
14485,"But this mere Being, as it is mere abstraction, is therefore the absolutely negative: which, in a similarly immediate aspect, is just Nothing
- EnL",147
14486,"In fact this definition is implied in saying that the thing-in-itself is the indeterminate, utterly without form and so without content,--or in saying that God is only the supreme Being and nothing more; for this is really declaring Him to be the same negativity as above
- EnL",277
14487,"The Nothing which the Buddhists make the universal principle, as well as the final aim and goal of everything, is the same abstraction
- EnL",140
14488,"Thus we find Being identified with what persists amid all change, with matter, susceptible of innumerable determinations,--or even, unreflectingly, with a single existence, any chance object of the senses or of the mind
- EnL",225
14489,"But every additional and more concrete characterisation causes Being to lose that integrity and simplicity it has in the beginning
- EnL",136
14490,"Only in, and by virtue of, this mere generality is it Nothing, something inexpressible, whereof the distinction from Nothing is a mere intention or meaning
- EnL",161
14491,"All that is wanted is to realise that these beginnings are nothing but these empty abstractions, one as empty as the other
- EnL",128
14492,"The instinct that induces us to attach a settled import to Being, or to both, is the very necessity which leads to the onward movement of Being and Nothing, and gives them a true or concrete significance
- EnL",209
14493,"This advance is the logical deduction and the movement of thought exhibited in the sequel
- EnL",95
14494,"The reflection which finds a profounder connotation for Being and Nothing is nothing but logical thought, through which such connotation is evolved, not, however, in an accidental, but a necessary way
- EnL",206
14495,"Every signification, therefore, in which they afterwards appear, is only a more precise specification and truer definition of the Absolute
- EnL",144
14497,"The distinction between Being and Nought is, in the first place, only implicit, and not yet actually made: they only ought to be distinguished
- EnL",148
14498,"A distinction of course implies two things, and that one of them possesses an attribute which is not found in the other
- EnL",125
14499,"Being however is an absolute absence of attributes, and so is Nought
- EnL",74
14500,"Hence the distinction between the two is only meant to be; it is a quite nominal distinction, which is at the same time no distinction
- EnL",140
14501,"In all other cases of difference there is some common point which comprehends both things
- EnL",95
14502,"Suppose eg we speak of two different species: the genus forms a common ground for both
- EnL",92
14503,"But in the case of mere Being and Nothing, distinction is without a bottom to stand upon: hence there can be no distinction, both determinations being the same bottomlessness
- EnL",180
14505,"But if when we view the whole world we can only say that everything is, and nothing more, we are neglecting all speciality and, instead of absolute plenitude, we have absolute emptiness
- EnL",191
14507,"Nothing, if it be thus immediate and equal to itself, is also conversely the same as Being is
- EnL",99
14508,"The truth of Being and of Nothing is accordingly the unity of the two: and this unity is Becoming
- EnL",103
14509,"And indeed it is one of the hardest things thought expects itself to do: for Being and Nothing exhibit the fundamental contrast in all its immediacy,--that is, without the one term being invested with any attribute which would involve its connexion with the other
- EnL",269
14510,"This attribute however, as the above paragraph points out, is implicit in them--the attribute which is just the same in both
- EnL",130
14512,"The one is not what the other is
- EnL",38
14513,"But since the distinction has not at this point assumed definite shape (Being and Nothing are still the immediate), it is, in the way that they have it, something unutterable, which we merely mean
- EnL",202
14514,"If Being and Nought are identical, say these objectors, it follows that it makes no difference whether my home, my property, the air I breathe, this city, the sun, the law, mind, God, are or are not
- EnL",204
14515,"Now in some of these cases, the objectors foist in private aims, the utility a thing has for me, and then ask, whether it be all the same to me if the thing exist and if it do not
- EnL",185
14516,"For that matter indeed, the teaching of philosophy is precisely what frees man from the endless crowd of finite aims and intentions, by making him so insensible to them, that their existence or non-existence is to him a matter of indifference
- EnL",248
14518,"A substantial distinction is in these cases secretly substituted for the empty distinction of Being and Nought
- EnL",116
14519,"In others of the cases referred to, it is virtually absolute existences and vital ideas and aims, which are placed under the mere category of Being or not-Being
- EnL",166
14520,"But there is more to be said of these concrete objects, than that they merely are or are not
- EnL",98
14521,"Barren abstractions, like Being and Nothing--the initial categories which, for that reason, are the scantiest anywhere to be found--are utterly inadequate to the nature of these objects
- EnL",191
14523,"As for that, the notion of the unity is stated in the sections preceding, and that is all: apprehend that, and you have comprehended this unity
- EnL",149
14526,"But if to have no notion merely means that we cannot represent in imagination the oneness of Being and Nought, the statement is far from being true; for every one has countless ways of envisaging this unity
- EnL",212
14527,"To say that we have no such conception can only mean, that in none of these images do we recognise the notion in question, and that we are not aware that they exemplify it
- EnL",177
14528,"The readiest example of it is Becoming
- EnL",44
14529,"In its beginning, the thing is not yet, but it is more than merely nothing, for its Being is already in the beginning
- EnL",123
14531,"They misrepresent the facts, by giving an exclusive prominence to the unity, and leaving the difference which undoubtedly exists in it (because it is Being and Nothing, for example, the unity of which is declared) without any express mention or notice
- EnL",257
14532,"It accordingly seems as if the diversity had been unduly put out of court and neglected
- EnL",93
14533,"The fact is, no speculative principle can be correctly expressed by any such propositional form, for the unity has to be conceived in the diversity, which is all the while present and explicit
- EnL",198
14534,"The opposition between the two factors seems to have vanished; it is only implied in the unity, it is not explicitly put in it
- EnL",132
14535,"The ancients saw plainly that the maxim, 'From nothing comes nothing, from something something,' really abolishes Becoming: for what it comes from and what it becomes are one and the same
- EnL",193
14536,"Thus explained, the proposition is the maxim of abstract identity as upheld by the understanding
- EnL",102
14538,"Becoming is the first concrete thought, and therefore the first notion: whereas Being and Nought are empty abstractions
- EnL",125
14539,"The notion of Being, therefore, of which we sometimes speak, must mean Becoming; not the mere point of Being, which is empty Nothing, any more than Nothing, which is empty Being
- EnL",183
14540,"In Being then we have Nothing, and in Nothing Being: but this Being which does not lose itself in Nothing is Becoming
- EnL",123
14541,"Nor must we omit the distinction, while we emphasise the unity of Becoming: without that distinction we should once more return to abstract Being
- EnL",151
14542,"Becoming is only the explicit statement of what Being is in its truth
- EnL",75
14543,"We often hear it maintained that thought is opposed to being
- EnL",66
14544,"Now in the face of such a statement, our first question ought to be, what is meant by being
- EnL",97
14545,"If we understand being as it is defined by reflection, all that we can say of it is that it is what is wholly identical and affirmative
- EnL",141
14546,"And if we then look at thought, it cannot escape us that thought also is at least what is absolutely identical with itself
- EnL",128
14547,"Both I therefore, being as well as thought, have the same attribute
- EnL",73
14548,"This identity of being and thought is not however to be I taken in a concrete sense, as if we could say that a stone, so far as it has being, is the same as a thinking man
- EnL",177
14549,"A concrete thing is always very different from the abstract category as such
- EnL",82
14550,"And in the case of being, we are speaking of nothing concrete: for being is the utterly abstract
- EnL",102
14551,"So far then the question regarding the being of God--a being which is in itself concrete above all measure--is of slight importance
- EnL",137
14552,"As the first concrete thought-term, Becoming is the first adequate vehicle of truth
- EnL",89
14553,"In the history of philosophy, this stage of the logical Idea finds its analogue in the system of Heraclitus
- EnL",113
14555,"This maybe looked at as an instance of the real refutation of one system by another
- EnL",89
14556,"To refute a Philosophy is to exhibit the dialectical movement in its principle, and thus reduce it to a constituent member of a higher concrete form of the?
- EnL",162
14557,"Even Becoming however, taken at its best on its own ground, is an extremely poor term: it needs to grow in depth and weight of meaning
- EnL",140
14558,"Such deepened force we find eg in Life
- EnL",44
14559,"Life is a Becoming; but that is not enough to exhaust the notion of life
- EnL",78
14560,"A still higher form is found in Mind
- EnL",42
14561,"Here too is Becoming, but richer and more intensive than mere logical Becoming
- EnL",84
14562,"The elements, whose unity constitutes mind, are not the bare abstracts of Being and of Nought, but the system of the logical Idea and of Nature
- EnL",149
14563,"In Becoming the Being which is one with Nothing, and the Nothing which is one with Being, are only vanishing factors; they are and they are not
- EnL",149
14564,"Thus by its inherent contradiction Becoming collapses into the unity in which the two elements are absorbed
- EnL",113
14565,"This result is accordingly Being Determinate (Being there and so)
- EnL",71
14566,"In this first example we must call to mind, once for all, what was stated in § 82 and in the note there: the only way to secure any growth and progress in knowledge is to hold results fast in their truth
- EnL",209
14568,"Whenever such contradiction, then, is discovered in any object or notion, the usual inference is, Hence this object is nothing
- EnL",132
14571,"Hence Being Determinate is (1) the unity of Being and Nothing, in which we get rid of the immediacy in these determinations, and their contradiction vanishes in their mutual connexion,--the unity in which they are only constituent elements
- EnL",245
14572,"And (2) since the result is the abolition of the contradiction, it comes in the shape of a simple unity with itself: that is to say, it also is Being, but Being with negation or determinateness: it is Becoming expressly put in the form of one of its elements, viz Being
- EnL",275
14573,"Even our ordinary conception of Becoming implies that somewhat comes out of it, and that Becoming therefore has a result
- EnL",126
14574,"But this conception gives rise to the question, how Becoming does not remain mere Becoming, but has a result The answer to this question follows from what Becoming has already shown itself to be
- EnL",200
14575,"Becoming always contains Being and Nothing in such a way, that these two are always changing into each other, and reciprocally cancelling each other
- EnL",154
14576,"Thus Becoming stands before us in utter restlessness--unable however to maintain itself in this abstract restlessness: for since Being and Nothing vanish in Becoming (and that is the very notion of Becoming), the latter must vanish also
- EnL",242
14577,"Becoming is as it were a fire, which dies out in itself, when it consumes its material
- EnL",92
14578,"The result of this process however is not an empty Nothing but Being identical with the negation,--what we call Being Determinate (being then and there): the primary import of which evidently is that it has become
- EnL",219
14579,"And as reflected into itself in this its character or mode, Determinate Being is a somewhat, an existent--The categories, which issue by a closer analysis of Determinate Being, need only be mentioned briefly
- EnL",213
14580,"Quality may be described as the determinate mode immediate and identical with Being--as distinguished from Quantity (to come afterwards), which, although a mode of Being, is no longer immediately identical with Being, but a mode indifferent and external to it
- EnL",265
14581,"A Something is what it is in virtue of its quality, and losing its quality it ceases to be what it is
- EnL",107
14582,"Quality, moreover, is completely a category only of the finite, and for that reason too it has its proper place in Nature, not in the world of Mind
- EnL",153
14583,"Thus, for example, in Nature what are styled the elementary bodies, oxygen, nitrogen, &c, should be regarded as existing qualities
- EnL",136
14584,"But in the sphere of mind, Quality appears in a subordinate way only, and not as if its qualitativeness could exhaust any specific aspect of mind
- EnL",151
14585,"If, for example, we consider the subjective mind, which forms the object of psychology, we may describe what is called (moral and mental) character, as in logical language identical with Quality
- EnL",200
14586,"This however does not mean that character is a mode of being which pervades the soul and is immediately identical with it, as is the case in the natural world with the elementary bodies before mentioned
- EnL",208
14587,"Yet a more distinct manifestation of Quality as such, in mind even, is found in the case of besotted or morbid conditions, especially in states of passion and when the passion rises to derangement
- EnL",202
14588,"The state of mind of a deranged person, being one mass of jealousy, fear, &c, may suitably be described as Quality
- EnL",120
14589,"Quality, as determinateness which is, as contrasted with the Negation which is involved in it but distinguished from it, is Reality
- EnL",137
14590,"Negation is no longer an abstract nothing, but, as a determinate being and somewhat, is only a form on such being--it is as Otherness
- EnL",139
14591,"Since this otherness, though a determination of Quality itself, is in the first instance distinct from it, Quality is Being-for-another--an expansion of the mere point of Determinate Being, or of Somewhat
- EnL",210
14592,"The Being as such of Quality, contrasted with this reference to somewhat else, is Being-by-self
- EnL",101
14593,"The foundation of all determinateness is negation (as Spinoza says, Omnis determinatio est negatio)
- EnL",105
14594,"The unreflecting observer supposes that determinate things are merely positive, and pins them down under the form of being
- EnL",128
14595,"Mere being however is not the end of the matter:--it is, as we have already seen, utter emptiness and instability besides
- EnL",127
14597,"In the same sense the body may be called the reality of the soul, and the law the reality of freedom, and the world altogether the reality of the divine idea
- EnL",163
14598,"The word 'reality' is however used in another acceptation to mean that something behaves conformably to its essential characteristic or notion
- EnL",148
14599,"For example, we use the expression: This is a real occupation: This is a real man
- EnL",87
14600,"Here the term does not merely mean outward and immediate existence: but rather that some existence agrees with its notion
- EnL",127
14601,"In which sense, be it added, reality is not distinct from the ideality which we shall in the first instance become acquainted with in the shape of Being-for-self
- EnL",167
14602,"In Being (determinate there and then), the determinateness is one with Being; yet at the same time, when explicitly made a negation, it is a Limit, a Barrier
- EnL",163
14603,"Hence the otherness is not something indifferent and outside it, but a function proper to it
- EnL",98
14604,"Somewhat is by its quality,--firstly finite,--secondly alterable; so that finitude and variability appertain to its being
- EnL",127
14605,"In Being-there-and-then, the negation is still directly one with the Being, and this negation is what we call a Limit (Boundary)
- EnL",134
14606,"A thing is what it is, only in and by reason of its limit
- EnL",63
14607,"We cannot therefore regard the limit as only paternal to being which is then and there
- EnL",92
14608,"It rather goes through and through the whole of such existence
- EnL",68
14609,"The view of limit, as merely an external characteristic of being-there-and-then, arises from a confusion of quantitative with qualitative limit
- EnL",149
14610,"Here we are speaking primarily of the qualitative limit
- EnL",61
14611,"If, for example, we observe a piece of ground, three acres large, that circumstance is its quantitative limit
- EnL",115
14612,"But, in addition, the ground is, it may be, a meadow, not a wood or a pond
- EnL",80
14613,"This is its qualitative limit--Man, if he wishes to be actual, must be-there-and-then, and to this end he must set a limit to himself
- EnL",139
14614,"People who are too fastidious towards the finite never reach actuality, but linger lost in abstraction, and their light dies away
- EnL",135
14615,"If we take a closer look at what a limit implies, we see it involving a contradiction in itself, and thus evincing its dialectical nature
- EnL",143
14616,"On the one side the limit makes the reality of a thing; on the other it is its negation
- EnL",93
14617,"But, again, the limit, as the negation of something, is not an abstract nothing but a nothing which is,--what we call an 'other'
- EnL",134
14618,"Given something, and up starts an other to us: we know that there is not something only, but an other as well
- EnL",115
14619,"Nor, again, is the other of such a nature that we can think something apart from it; a something is implicitly the other of itself, and the somewhat sees its limit become objective to it in the other
- EnL",205
14620,"If we now ask for the difference between something and another, it turns out that they are the same: which sameness is expressed in Latin by calling the pair aliud--aliud
- EnL",176
14621,"The other, as opposed to the something, is itself a something, and hence we say some other, or something else; and so on the other hand the first something when opposed to the other, also defined as something, is itself an other
- EnL",234
14622,"Thus we suppose that the moon, being something else than the sun, might very well exist without the sun
- EnL",109
14623,"But really the moon, as a something, has its other implicit in it: Plato says: God made the world out of the nature of the 'one' and the 'other' (τοῦ ἑτέρου): having brought these together, he formed from them a third, which is of the nature of the 'one' and the 'other'
- EnL",276
14624,"In these words we have in general terms a statement of the nature of the finite, which, as something, does not meet the nature of the other as if it had no affinity to it, but, being implicitly the other of itself, thus undergoes alteration
- EnL",246
14625,"Alteration thus exhibits the inherent contradiction which originally attaches to determinate being, and which forces it out of its own bounds
- EnL",147
14626,"To materialised conception existence stands in the character of something solely positive, and quietly abiding within its own limits: though we also know, it is true, that everything finite (such as existence) is subject to change
- EnL",236
14627,"Such changeableness in existence is to the superficial eye a mere possibility, the realisation of which is not a consequence of its own nature
- EnL",148
14628,"But the fact is, mutability lies in the notion of existence, and change is only the manifestation of what it implicitly is
- EnL",128
14629,"The living die, simply because as living they bear in themselves the germ of death
- EnL",88
14630,"Something becomes an other: this other is itself somewhat: therefore it likewise becomes an other, and so on ad infinitum
- EnL",127
14631,"This Infinity is the wrong or negative infinity: it is only a negation of a finite: but the finite rises again the same as ever, and is never got rid of and absorbed
- EnL",171
14632,"In other words, this infinite only expresses the ought-to-be elimination of the finite
- EnL",92
14633,"The progression to infinity never gets further than a statement of the contradiction involved in the finite, viz that it is somewhat as well as somewhat else
- EnL",163
14634,"It sets up with endless iteration the alternation between these two terms, each of which calls up the other
- EnL",113
14635,"If we let somewhat and another, the elements of determinate Being, fall asunder, the result is that some becomes other, and this other is itself a somewhat, which then as such changes likewise, and so on ad infinitum
- EnL",222
14636,"This result seems to superficial reflection something very grand, the grandest possible
- EnL",93
14637,"Besuch a progression to infinity is not the real infinite
- EnL",63
14638,"That consists in being at home with itself in its other, or, if enunciated as a process, in coming to itself in its other
- EnL",127
14639,"Much depends on rightly apprehending the notion of infinity, and not stopping short at the wrong infinity of endless progression
- EnL",134
14640,"The case is the same with space, the infinity of which has formed the theme of barren declamation to astronomers with a talent for edification
- EnL",148
14641,"In the attempt to contemplate such an infinite, our thought, we are commonly informed, must sink exhausted
- EnL",112
14642,"It is true indeed that we must abandon the unending contemplation, not however because the occupation is too sublime, but because it is too tedious
- EnL",153
14643,"It is tedious to expatiate in the contemplation of this infinite progression, because the same thing is constantly recurring
- EnL",130
14644,"We lay down a limit: then we pass it: next we have a limit once more, and so on for ever
- EnL",94
14645,"All this is but superficial alternation, which never leaves the region of the finite behind
- EnL",97
14646,"To suppose that by stepping out and away into that infinity we release ourselves from the finite, is in truth but to seek the release which comes by flight
- EnL",161
14647,"But the man who flees is not yet free: in fleeing he is still conditioned by that from which he flees
- EnL",107
14648,"If it be also said, that the infinite is unattainable, the statement is true, but only because to the idea of infinity has been attached the circumstance of being simply and solely negative
- EnL",195
14649,"With such empty and other world stuff philosophy has nothing to do
- EnL",72
14650,"What philosophy has to do with is always--something concrete and in the highest sense present
- EnL",99
14651,"No doubt philosophy has also sometimes been set the task of finding an answer to the question, how the infinite comes to the resolution of issuing out of itself
- EnL",166
14652,"This question, founded, as it is, upon the assumption of a rigid opposition between finite and infinite, may be answered by saying that the opposition is false, and that in point of fact the infinite eternally proceeds out of itself, and yet does not proceed out of itself
- EnL",278
14654,"The infinity of reflection here discussed is only an attempt to reach the true Infinity, a wretched neither-one-thing-nor-another
- EnL",135
14655,"Generally speaking, it is the point of view which has in recent times been emphasised in Germany
- EnL",102
14656,"The finite, this theory tells us, ought to be absorbed; the infinite ought not to be a negative merely, but also a positive
- EnL",129
14657,"That 'ought to be' betrays the incapacity of actually making good a claim which is at the same time recognised to be right
- EnL",128
14658,"This stage was never passed by the systems of Kant and Fichte, so far as ethics are concerned
- EnL",99
14659,"The utmost to which this way brings us is only the postulate of a never-ending approximation to the law of Reason: which postulate has been made an argument for the immortality of the soul
- EnL",194
14661,"To be thus self-related in the passage, and in the other, is the genuine Infinity
- EnL",87
14662,"Or, under a negative aspect: what is altered is the other, it becomes the other of the other
- EnL",98
14663,"Thus Being, but as negation of the negation, is restored again: it is now Being-for-self
- EnL",94
14664,"Dualism, in putting an insuperable opposition between finite and infinite, fails to note the simple circumstance that the infinite is thereby only one of two, and is reduced to a particular, to which the finite forms the other particular
- EnL",243
14665,"Such an infinite, which is only a particular, is co-terminous with the finite which makes for it a limit and a barrier: it is not what it ought to be, that is, the infinite, but is only finite
- EnL",198
14666,"In such circumstances, where the finite is on this side, and the infinite on that,--this world as the finite and the other world as the infinite,--an equal dignity of permanence and independence is ascribed to finite and to infinite
- EnL",238
14667,"The being of the finite is made an absolute being, and by this dualism gets independence and stability
- EnL",108
14668,"Touched, so to speak, by the infinite, it would be annihilated
- EnL",68
14669,"But it must not be touched by the infinite
- EnL",48
14670,"There must be an abyss, an impassable gulf between the two, with the infinite abiding on yonder side and the finite steadfast on this
- EnL",139
14671,"Those who attribute to the finite this inflexible persistence in comparison with the infinite are not, as they imagine, far above metaphysic: they are still on the level of the most ordinary metaphysic of understanding
- EnL",224
14672,"For the same thing occurs here as in the infinite progression
- EnL",67
14673,"At one time it is admitted that the finite has no independent actuality, no absolute being, no root and development of its own, but is only a transient
- EnL",157
14674,"But next moment this is straightway forgotten; the finite, made a mere counterpart to the infinite, wholly separated from it, and rescued from annihilation, is conceived to be persistent in its independence
- EnL",212
14675,"While thought thus imagines itself elevated to the infinite, it meets with the opposite fate: it comes to an infinite which is only a finite, and the finite, which it had left behind, has always to be retained and made into an absolute
- EnL",241
14677,"Such a statement would be to some extent correct; but is just as open to perversion and falsehood as the unity of Being and Nothing already noticed
- EnL",153
14678,"Besides it may very fairly be charged with reducing the infinite to finitude and making a finite infinite
- EnL",111
14679,"For, so far as the expression goes, the finite seems left in its place,--it is not expressly stated to be absorbed
- EnL",120
14681,"And this does really happen with the abstract one-sided infinite of understanding
- EnL",87
14682,"The genuine infinite however is not merely in the position of the one-sided acid, and so does not lose itself
- EnL",115
14683,"The negation of negation is not a neutralisation: the infinite is the affirmative, and it is only the finite which is absorbed
- EnL",132
14684,"In Being-for-self enters the category of Ideality
- EnL",55
14685,"Being-there-and-then, as in the first instance apprehended in its being or affirmation, has reality (§ 91): and thus even finitude in the first instance is in the category of reality
- EnL",188
14686,"But the truth of the finite is rather its ideality
- EnL",56
14687,"Similarly, the infinite of understanding, which is co-ordinated with the finite, is itself only one of two finites, no whole truth, but a non-substantial element
- EnL",167
14688,"This ideality of the finite is the chief maxim of philosophy; and for that reason every genuine philosophy is idealism
- EnL",124
14689,"But everything depends upon not taking for the infinite what, in the very terms of its characterisation, is
- EnL",113
14690,"The fundamental notion of philosophy, the genuine infinite, depends upon it
- EnL",81
14691,"The distinction is cleared up by the simple, and for that reason seemingly insignificant, but incontrovertible reflections, contained in the first paragraph of this section
- EnL",178
14692,"This unit, being without distinction in itself, thus excludes the other from itself
- EnL",89
14693,"To be for self--to be one--is completed Quality, and as such, contains abstract Being and Being modified as non-substantial elements
- EnL",138
14695,"The readiest instance of Being-for-self is found in the 'I'
- EnL",65
14696,"But we also come to know this expansion of existence (in these relations) reduced, as it were, to a point in the simple form of being-for-self
- EnL",148
14697,"When we say 'I,' we express the reference-to-self which is infinite, and at the same time negative
- EnL",104
14699,"It is said, that besides reality there is also an ideality
- EnL",64
14700,"Thus the two categories are made equal and parallel
- EnL",57
14701,"Properly speaking, ideality is not somewhat outside of and beside reality: the notion of ideality just lies in its being the truth of reality
- EnL",147
14702,"That is to say, when reality is explicitly put as what it implicitly is, it is at once seen to be ideality
- EnL",112
14703,"Hence ideality has not received its proper estimation, when you allow that reality is not all in all, but that an ideality must be recognised outside of it
- EnL",161
14704,"Such an ideality, external to or it may be even beyond reality, would be no better than an empty name
- EnL",107
14705,"Ideality only has a meaning when it is the ideality of something: but this something is not a mere indefinite this or that, but existence characterised as reality, which, if retained in isolation, possesses no truth
- EnL",221
14706,"The distinction between Nature and Mind is not improperly conceived, when the former is traced back to reality, and the latter to ideality as a fundamental category
- EnL",170
14707,"Nature however is far from being so fixed and complete, as to subsist even without Mind: in Mind it first, as it were, attains its goal and its truth
- EnL",155
14709,"This double usage of language, which gives to the same word a positive and negative meaning, is not an accident, and gives no ground for reproaching language as a cause of confusion
- EnL",187
14710,"We should rather recognise in it the speculative spirit of our language rising above the mere 'Either--or' of understanding
- EnL",129
14711,"So far as regards the immediacy of the self-existents, these Many are: and the repulsion of every One of them becomes to that extent their repulsion against each other as existing units,--in other words, their reciprocal exclusion
- EnL",236
14712,"This question is unanswerable by the consciousness which pictures the Many as a primary datum, and-treats the One as only one among the Many
- EnL",146
14713,"But the philosophic notion teaches, contrariwise, that the One forms the pre-supposition of the Many: and in the thought of the One is implied that it explicitly make itself Many
- EnL",184
14715,"Hereby the One manifests an utter incompatibility with itself, a self-repulsion: and what it makes itself explicitly be, is the Many
- EnL",138
14716,"We may denote this side in the process of Being-for-self by the figurative term Repulsion
- EnL",95
14717,"Repulsion is a term originally employed in the study of matter, to mean that matter, as a Many, in each of these many Ones, behaves as exclusive to all the others
- EnL",168
14718,"It would be wrong however to view the process of repulsion, as if the One were the repellent and the Many the repelled
- EnL",124
14719,"The One, as already remarked, just is self-exclusion and explicit putting itself as the Many
- EnL",98
14720,"Each of the Many however is itself a One, and in virtue of its so behaving, this all-round repulsion is by one stroke converted into its opposite,--Attraction
- EnL",164
14722,"The repulsion therefore has an equal right to be called Attraction; and the exclusive One, or Being-for-self, suppresses itself
- EnL",133
14723,"The qualitative character, which in the One or unit has reached the extreme point of its characterisation, has thus passed over into determinateness (quality) suppressed, ie into Being as Quantity
- EnL",202
14724,"The philosophy of the Atomists is the doctrine in which the Absolute is formulated as Being-for-self, as One, and many ones
- EnL",129
14725,"And it is the repulsion, which shows itself in the notion of the One, which is assumed as the fundamental force in these atoms
- EnL",132
14726,"But instead of attraction, it is Accident, that is, mere unintelligence, which is expected to bring them together
- EnL",119
14727,"So long as the One is fixed as one, it is certainly impossible to regard its congression with others as anything but external and mechanical
- EnL",146
14731,"According to it, the will of individuals as such is the creative principle of the State: the attracting force is the special wants and inclinations of individuals; and the Universal, or the State itself, is the external nexus of a compact
- EnL",244
14732,"The principle of that system may be described as Being-for-self in the shape of the Many
- EnL",94
14733,"At present, students of nature who are anxious to avoid metaphysics turn a favourable ear to Atomism
- EnL",106
14734,"But it is not possible to escape metaphysics and cease to trace nature back to terms of thought, by throwing ourselves into the arms of Atomism
- EnL",149
14735,"The atom, in fact, is itself a thought; and hence the theory which holds matter to consist of atoms is a metaphysical theory
- EnL",130
14736,"Newton gave physics an express warning to beware of metaphysics, it is true; but, to his honour be it said, he did not by any means obey his own warning
- EnL",158
14737,"The only mere physicists are the animals: they alone do not think: while man is a thinking being and a born metaphysician
- EnL",127
14739,"It is on this ground that one objects to the Atomic philosophy
- EnL",68
14740,"The old Atomists viewed the world as a many, as their successors often do to this day
- EnL",91
14741,"On chance they laid the task of collecting the atoms which float about in the void
- EnL",88
14742,"But, after all, the nexus binding the many with one another is by no means a mere accident: as we have already remarked, the nexus is founded on their very nature
- EnL",168
14743,"To Kant we owe the completed theory of matter as the unity of repulsion and attraction
- EnL",92
14744,"The theory is correct, so far as it recognises attraction to be the other of the two elements involved in the notion of Being-for-self: and to be an element no less essential than repulsion to constitute matter
- EnL",216
14745,"Still this dynamical construction of matter, as it is termed, has the fault of taking for granted, instead of deducing, attraction and repulsion
- EnL",150
14746,"Had they been deduced, we should then have seen the How and the Why of a unity which is merely asserted
- EnL",109
14747,"Kant indeed was careful to inculcate that Matter must not be taken to be in existence per se, and then as it were incidentally to be provided with the two forces mentioned, but must be regarded as consisting solely in their unity
- EnL",235
14748,"German physicists for some time accepted this pure dynamic
- EnL",64
14750,"This too is metaphysics; and metaphysics which, for its utter unintelligence, there would be sufficient reason to guard against
- EnL",133
14751,"We are in the habit of saying that things are not merely qualitatively, but also quantitatively defined; but whence these categories originate, and how they are related to each other, are questions not further examined
- EnL",224
14752,"The fact is, quantity just means quality superseded and absorbed: and it is by the dialectic of quality here examined that this supersession is effected
- EnL",158
14753,"First of all, we had Being: as the truth of Being, came Becoming: which formed the passage to Being Determinate: and the truth of that we found to be Alteration
- EnL",166
14755,"Still this superseded and absorbed quality is neither an abstract nothing, nor an equally abstract and featureless being: it is only being as indifferent to determinateness or character
- EnL",191
14756,"This aspect of being is also what appears as quantity in our ordinary conceptions
- EnL",87
14757,"If we proceed to consider their quantity, we get the conception of an indifferent and external character or mode, of such a kind that a thing remains what it is, though its quantity is altered, and the thing becomes greater or less
- EnL",237
14758,"Quantity is pure being, where the mode or character is no longer taken as one with the being itself, but explicitly put as superseded or indifferent
- EnL",154
14760,"This point of view is upon the whole the same as when the Absolute is defined to be Matter, in which, though form undoubtedly is present, the form is a characteristic of no importance one way or another
- EnL",208
14762,"The mathematical definition of magnitude as what may be increased or diminished, appears at first sight to be more plausible and perspicuous than the exposition of the notion in the present section
- EnL",203
14763,"When closely examined, however, it involves, under cover of pre-suppositions and images, the same elements as appear in the notion of quantity reached by the method of logical development
- EnL",193
14765,"What then, it may be asked, is the fault which we have to find with this definition?
- EnL",90
14766,"It is that to increase and to diminish is the same thing as to characterise magnitude otherwise
- EnL",101
14767,"If this aspect then were an adequate account of it, quantity would be described merely as whatever can be altered
- EnL",119
14769,"One remark more
- EnL",21
14771,"To apply this to the present case
- EnL",39
14772,"However correct and self-evident the definition of quantity usual in Mathematics may be, it will still fail to satisfy the wish to see how far this particular thought is founded in universal thought, and in that way necessary
- EnL",231
14773,"This difficulty, however, is not the only one
- EnL",51
14774,"If quantity is not reached through the action of thought, but taken uncritically from our generalised image of it, we are liable to exaggerate the range of its validity, or even to raise it to the height of an absolute category
- EnL",233
14775,"And that such a danger is real, we see when the title of exact science is restricted to those sciences the objects of which can be submitted to mathematical calculation
- EnL",174
14776,"Here we have another trace of the bad metaphysics (mentioned in § 98, note) which replace the concrete idea by partial and inadequate categories of understanding
- EnL",167
14778,"The pernicious consequences, to which such a theory gives rise in practice, are at once evident
- EnL",101
14779,"And this mere mathematical view, which identifies with the Idea one of its special stages, viz quantity, is no other than the principle of Materialism
- EnL",156
14780,"Witness the history of the scientific modes of thought, especially in France since the middle of last century
- EnL",115
14781,"Matter, in the abstract, is just what, though of course there is form in it, has that form only as an indifferent and external attribute
- EnL",142
14782,"The present explanation would be utterly misconceived if it were supposed to disparage mathematics
- EnL",104
14783,"By calling the quantitative characteristic merely external and indifferent, we provide no excuse for indolence and superficiality, nor do we assert that quantitative characteristics may be left to mind themselves, or at least require no very careful handling
- EnL",264
14784,"Quantity, of course, is a stage of the Idea: and as such it must have its due, first as a logical category, and then in the world of objects, natural as well as spiritual
- EnL",176
14785,"Still even so, there soon emerges the different importance attaching to the category of quantity according as its objects belong to the natural or to the spiritual world
- EnL",175
14786,"For in Nature, where the form of the Idea is to be other than, and at the same time outside, itself, greater importance is for that very reason attached to quantity than in the spiritual world, the world of free inwardness
- EnL",228
14788,"Even inside the realm of Nature we find the same distinction of greater or less importance of quantitative features
- EnL",121
14789,"In the inorganic world, Quantity plays, so to say, a more prominent part than in the organic
- EnL",98
14790,"Even in organic nature when we distinguish mechanical functions from what are called chemical, and in the narrower sense, physical, there is the same difference
- EnL",166
14791,"Mechanics is of all branches of science, confessedly, that in which the aid of mathematics can be least dispensed with,--where indeed we cannot take one step without them
- EnL",176
14792,"On that account mechanics is regarded next to mathematics as the science par excellence; which leads us to repeat the remark about the coincidence of the materialist with the exclusively mathematical point of view
- EnL",219
14793,"After all that has been said, we cannot but hold it, in the interest of exact and thorough knowledge, one of the most hurtful prejudices, to seek all distinction and determinateness of objects merely in quantitative considerations
- EnL",236
14795,"Quantity, as we saw, has two sources: the exclusive unit, and the identification or equalisation of these units
- EnL",117
14796,"Still continuous quantity has also a certain discreteness, being but a continuity of the Many: and discrete quantity is no less continuous, its continuity being the One or Unit, that is, the self-same point of the many Ones
- EnL",229
14797,"The only distinction between them is that the same whole (of quantity) is at one time explicitly put under the one, at another under the other of its characteristics
- EnL",171
14798,"If we explicitly invest time, space, or matter with the attribute of Continuous quantity alone, they are divisible ad infinitum
- EnL",133
14799,"When, on the contrary, they are invested with the attribute of Discrete quantity, they are potentially divided already, and consist of indivisible units
- EnL",158
14800,"The one view is as inadequate as the other
- EnL",48
14801,"Quantity, as the proximate result of Being-for-self, involves the two sides in the process of the latter, attraction and repulsion, as constitutive elements of its own idea
- EnL",178
14802,"It is consequently Continuous as well as Discrete
- EnL",55
14803,"Each of these two elements involves the other also, and hence there is no such thing as a merely Continuous or a merely Discrete quantity
- EnL",143
14804,"Thus, it may be said, the space occupied by this room is a continuous magnitude, and the hundred men, assembled in it, form a discrete magnitude
- EnL",150
14805,"And yet the space is continuous and discrete at the same time; hence we speak of points of space, or we divide space, a certain length, into so many feet, inches, &c, which can be done only on the hypothesis that space is also potentially discrete
- EnL",253
14806,"Similarly, on the other hand, the discrete magnitude, made up of a hundred men, is also continuous: and the circumstance on which this continuity depends, is the common element, the species man, which pervades all the individuals and unites them with each other
- EnL",267
14807,"Quantity, essentially invested with the exclusionist character which it involves, is Quantum (or How Much): ie limited quantity
- EnL",133
14808,"Quantum is, as it were, the determinate Being of quantity: whereas mere quantity corresponds to abstract Being, and the Degree, which is next to be considered, corresponds to Being-for-self
- EnL",195
14810,"But in this way the quantum breaks up at the same time into an indefinite multitude of Quanta or definite magnitudes
- EnL",122
14811,"Each of these definite magnitudes, as distinguished from the others, forms a unity, while on the other hand, viewed per se, it is a many
- EnL",142
14812,"And, when that is done, the quantum is described as Number
- EnL",64
14813,"In Number the quantum reaches its development and perfect mode
- EnL",68
14814,"Like the One, the medium in which it exists, Number involves two qualitative factors or functions; Annumeration or Sum, which depends on the factor discreteness, and Unity, which depends on continuity
- EnL",206
14815,"In arithmetic the several kinds of operation are usually presented as accidental modes of dealing with numbers
- EnL",116
14816,"If necessity and meaning is to be found in these operations, it must be by a principle: and that must come from the characteristic elements in the notion of number itself
- EnL",176
14817,"These characteristic elements are Annumeration on the one hand, and Unity on the other, which together constitute number
- EnL",126
14818,"But Unity, when applied to empirical numbers, is only the equality of these numbers: hence the principle of arithmetical operations must be to put numbers in the ratio of Unity and Sum (or amount), and to elicit the equality of these two modes
- EnL",249
14819,"The Ones or the numbers themselves are indifferent towards each other, and hence the unity into which they are translated by the arithmetical operation takes the aspect of an external colligation
- EnL",201
14820,"All reckoning is therefore making up the tale: and the difference between the species of it lies only in the qualitative constitution of the numbers of which we make up the tale
- EnL",183
14821,"The principle for this constitution is given by the way we fix Unity and Annumeration
- EnL",91
14822,"Numeration comes first: what we may call, making number; a colligation of as many units as we please
- EnL",106
14823,"But to get a species of calculation, it is necessary that what we count up should be numbers already, and no longer a mere unit
- EnL",133
14824,"First, and as they naturally come to hand, Numbers are quite vaguely numbers in general, and so, on the whole, unequal
- EnL",124
14825,"The colligation, or telling the tale of these, is Addition
- EnL",64
14826,"The second point of view under which we regard numbers is as equal, so that they make one unity, and of such there is an annumeration or sum before us
- EnL",156
14827,"To tell the tale of these is Multiplication
- EnL",49
14828,"It makes no matter in the process, how the functions of Sum and Unity are distributed between the two numbers, or factors of the product; either may be Sum and either may be Unity
- EnL",185
14829,"The third and final point of view is the equality of Sum (amount) and Unity
- EnL",81
14830,"To number together numbers when so characterised is Involution; and in the first instance raising them to the square power
- EnL",128
14832,"Corresponding to the integration we have the dissolution of numbers according to the same features
- EnL",104
14833,"Hence besides the three species mentioned, which may to that extent be called positive, there are three negative species of arithmetical operation
- EnL",152
14834,"Number, in general, is the quantum in its complete specialisation
- EnL",71
14835,"Hence we may employ it not only to determine what we call discrete, but what are called continuous magnitudes as well
- EnL",123
14836,"For that reason even geometry must call in the aid of number, when it is required to specify definite figurations of space and their ratios
- EnL",145
14837,"The limit (in a quantum) is identical with the whole of the quantum itself
- EnL",80
14838,"As in itself multiple, the limit is Extensive magnitude; as in itself simple determinateness (qualitative simplicity), it is Intensive magnitude or Degree
- EnL",160
14839,"The distinction between Continuous and Discrete magnitude differs from that between Extensive and Intensive in the circumstance that the former apply to quantity in general, while the latter apply to the limit or determinateness of it as such
- EnL",248
14840,"Intensive and Extensive magnitude are not, any more than the other, two species, of which the one involves a character not possessed by the other: what is Extensive magnitude is just as much Intensive, and vice versâ
- EnL",222
14841,"Intensive magnitude or Degree is in its notion distinct from Extensive magnitude or the Quantum
- EnL",101
14842,"It is therefore inadmissible to refuse, as many do, to recognise this distinction, and without scruple to identify the two forms of magnitude
- EnL",147
14843,"They are so identified in physics, when difference of specific gravity is explained by saying, that a body, with a specific gravity twice that of another, contains within the same space twice as many material parts (or atoms) as the other
- EnL",244
14844,"So with heat and light, if the various degrees of temperature and brilliancy were to be explained by the greater or less number of particles (or molecules) of heat and light
- EnL",179
14846,"This greater convenience is meant to point to the easier application of the calculus: but it is hard to see why Intensive magnitudes, having, as they do, a definite numerical expression of their own, should not be as convenient for calculation as Extensive magnitudes
- EnL",273
14847,"If convenience be all that is desired, surely it would be more convenient to banish calculation and thought altogether
- EnL",124
14849,"It is certainly a fact of experience that, if one of two purses filled with shillings is twice as heavy as the other, the reason must be, that the one contains, say two hundred, and the other only one hundred shillings
- EnL",224
14850,"These pieces of money we can see and feel with our senses: atoms, molecules, and the like, are on the contrary beyond the range of sensuous perception; and thought alone can decide whether they are admissible, and have a meaning
- EnL",234
14851,"But (as already noticed in § 98, note) it is abstract understanding which stereotypes the factor of multeity (involved in the notion of Being-for-self) in the shape of atoms, and adopts it as an ultimate principle
- EnL",219
14853,"Among the charges made against modern philosophy, one is heard more than another
- EnL",86
14854,"Modern philosophy, it is said, reduces everything to identity
- EnL",67
14855,"Hence its nickname, the Philosophy of Identity
- EnL",52
14857,"It is their philosophy which might more appropriately be termed one of identity
- EnL",85
14858,"Besides it is quite correct that there are no merely Extensive and merely Intensive magnitudes, just as little as there are merely continuous and merely discrete magnitudes
- EnL",178
14859,"The two characteristics of quantity are not opposed as independent kinds
- EnL",78
14860,"Every Intensive magnitude is also Extensive, and vice versâ
- EnL",65
14861,"Thus a certain degree of temperature is an Intensive magnitude, which has a perfectly simple sensation corresponding to it as such
- EnL",136
14862,"If we look at a thermometer, we find this degree of temperature has a certain expansion of the column of mercury corresponding to it; which Extensive magnitude changes simultaneously with the temperature or Intensive magnitude
- EnL",232
14863,"The case is similar in the world of mind: a more intensive character has a wider range with its effects than a less intensive
- EnL",131
14864,"In Degree the notion of quantum is explicitly put
- EnL",55
14865,"It is magnitude as indifferent on its own account and simple: but in such a way that the character (or modal being) which makes it a quantum lies quite outside it in other magnitudes
- EnL",188
14867,"Number is a thought, but thought in its complete self-externalisation
- EnL",75
14869,"The infinite quantitative progression is only the meaningless repetition of one and the same contradiction, which attaches to the quantum, both generally and, when explicitly invested with its special character, as degree
- EnL",227
14870,"Touching the futility of enunciating this contradiction in the form of infinite progression, Zeno, as quoted by Aristotle, rightly says, 'It is the same to say a thing once, and to say it for ever'
- EnL",203
14872,"In the way of our logical evolution, on the contrary, quantity is obviously a grade the process of self-determining thought; and it has been shown that it lies in the very notion of quantity to shoot out beyond itself
- EnL",223
14873,"In that way, the increase or diminution (of which we have heard) is not merely possible, but necessary
- EnL",108
14874,"The same thing however holds good of this progression, as was already remarked on the occasion of the qualitatively, infinite progression
- EnL",143
14875,"As was then said, it is not the expression of a true, but of a wrong infinity; it never gets further than a bare 'ought,' and thus really remains within the limits of finitude
- EnL",181
14876,"The quantitative form of this infinite progression, which Spinoza rightly calls a mere imaginary infinity (infinitum imaginationis,) is an image often employed by poets, such as Haller and Klopstock, to depict the infinity, not of Nature merely, but even of God Himself
- EnL",275
14878,"I heap up monstrous numbers, mountains of millions; I pile time upon time, and world on the top of world; and when from the awful height I cast a dizzy look towards Thee, all the power of number, multiplied a thousand times, is not yet one part of Thee
- EnL",258
14879,"Here then we meet, in the first place, that continual extrusion of quantity, and especially of number, beyond itself, which Kant describes as 'eery'
- EnL",154
14880,"The only really 'eery' thing about it is the wearisomeness of ever fixing, and anon unfixing a limit, without advancing a single step
- EnL",139
14881,"The same poet however well adds to that description of false infinity the closing line:      Ich zieh sie ab, und Du liegst ganz vor mir
- EnL",142
14882,"These I remove, and Thou liest all before me
- EnL",50
14883,"Which means, that the true infinite is more than a mere world beyond the finite, and that we, in order to become conscious of it, must renounce that progressus in infinitum
- EnL",178
14884,"To the ordinary mind this view must at first glance seem an utter paradox, perhaps a mere craze
- EnL",101
14885,"To answer this question, we must, in the first place, remember that the problem of philosophy consists in tracing back things to thoughts, and, of course, to definite thoughts
- EnL",181
14886,"Now, number is undoubtedly a thought: it is the thought nearest the sensible, or, more precisely expressed, it is the thought of the sensible itself, if we take the sensible to mean what is many, and in reciprocal exclusion
- EnL",229
14887,"The attempt to apprehend the universe as number is therefore the first step to metaphysics
- EnL",96
14888,"In the history of philosophy, Pythagoras, as we know, stands between the Ionian philosophers and the Eleatics
- EnL",115
14890,"We may gather from this, what is to be said of those who suppose that Pythagoras undoubtedly went too far, when he conceived the essence of things as mere number
- EnL",167
14891,"It is true, they admit, that we can number things; but, they contend, things are far more than mere numbers
- EnL",113
14892,"But in what respect are they more?
- EnL",40
14894,"As may be gathered from what has been said on the historical position of the Pythagorean school, the real state of the case is quite the reverse
- EnL",150
14895,"Let it be conceded that things are more than numbers; but the meaning of that admission must be that the bare thought of number is still insufficient to enunciate the definite notion or essence of things
- EnL",209
14896,"Instead, then, of saying that Pythagoras went too far with his philosophy of number, it would be nearer the truth to say that he did not go far enough; and in fact the Eleatics were the first to take the further step to pure thought
- EnL",238
14897,"Besides, even if there are not things, there are states of things, and phenomena of nature altogether, the character of which mainly rests on definite numbers and proportions
- EnL",180
14898,"This is especially the case with the difference of tones and their harmonic concord, which, according to a well-known tradition, first suggested to Pythagoras to conceive the essence of things as number
- EnL",208
14899,"Though it is unquestionably important to science to trace back these phenomena to the definite numbers on which they are based, it is wholly inadmissible to view the characterisation by thought as a whole, as merely numerical
- EnL",231
14900,"We may certainly feel ourselves prompted to associate the most general characteristics of thought with the first numbers: saying, 1 is the simple and immediate; 2 is difference and mediation; and 3 the unity of both of these
- EnL",230
14901,"Such associations however are purely external: there is nothing in the mere numbers to make them express these definite thoughts
- EnL",134
14902,"With every step in this method, the more arbitrary grows the association of definite numbers with definite thoughts
- EnL",121
14903,"Thus, we may view 4 as the unity of 1 and 3, and of the thoughts associated with them, but 4 is just as much the double of 2; similarly 9 is not merely the square of 3, but also the sum of 8 and I, of 7 and 2, and so on
- EnL",225
14904,"To attach, as do some secret societies of modern times, importance to all sorts of numbers and figures, is to some extent an innocent amusement, but it is also a sign of deficiency of intellectual resource
- EnL",211
14905,"These numbers, it is said, conceal a profound meaning, and suggest a deal to think about
- EnL",94
14906,"But the point in philosophy is, not what you may think, but what you do think: and the genuine air of thought is to be sought in thought itself, and not in arbitrarily selected symbols
- EnL",190
14907,"That the Quantum in its independent character is external to itself, is what constitutes its quality
- EnL",106
14908,"In that externality it is itself and referred connectively to itself
- EnL",74
14909,"There is a union in it of externality, ie the quantitative, and of independency (Being-for-self),--the qualitative
- EnL",120
14910,"The Quantum when explicitly put thus in its own self, is the Quantitative Ratio, a mode of being which, while, in its Exponent, it is an immediate quantum, is also mediation, viz the reference of some one quantum to another, forming the two sides of the ratio
- EnL",265
14911,"But the two quanta are not reckoned at their immediate value: their value is only in this relation
- EnL",104
14912,"The quantitative infinite progression appears at first as a continual extrusion of number beyond itself
- EnL",109
14913,"On looking closer, it is, however, apparent that in this progression quantity returns to itself: for the meaning of this progression, so far as thought goes, is the fact that number is determined by number
- EnL",211
14914,"And this gives the quantitative ratio
- EnL",43
14915,"Take, for example, the ratio 2:4
- EnL",38
14916,"Here we have two magnitudes (not counted in their several immediate values) in which we are only concerned with their mutual relations
- EnL",140
14918,"Consequently, in place of 2:4, we can put 3:6 without changing the ratio; as the exponent 2 remains the same in both cases
- EnL",128
14919,"The two sides of the ratio are still immediate quanta: and the qualitative and quantitative characteristics still external to one another
- EnL",143
14920,"But in their truth, seeing that the quantitative itself in its externality is relation to self, or seeing that the independence and the indifference of the character are combined, it is Measure
- EnL",199
14921,"Thus quantity by means of the dialectical movement so far studied through its several stages, turns out to be a return to quality
- EnL",135
14922,"The first notion of quantity presented to us was that of quality abrogated and absorbed
- EnL",93
14923,"That is to say, quantity seemed an external character not identical with Being, to which it is quite immaterial
- EnL",117
14924,"This notion, as we have seen, underlies the mathematical definition of magnitude as what can be increased or diminished
- EnL",125
14926,"We can, however, complete the definition by adding, that in quantity we have an alterable, which in spite of alterations still remains the same
- EnL",149
14927,"The notion of quantity, it thus turns out, implies an inherent contradiction
- EnL",82
14928,"This, contradiction is what forms the dialectic of quantity
- EnL",65
14929,"The result of the dialectic however is not a mere return to quality, as if that were the true and quantity the false notion, but an advance to the unity and truth of both, to qualitative quantity, or Measure
- EnL",213
14930,"It may be well therefore at this point to observe that whenever in our study of the objective world we are engaged in quantitative determinations, it is in all cases Measure which we have in view, as the goal of our operations
- EnL",232
14931,"This is hinted at even in language, when the ascertainment of quantitative features and relations is called measuring
- EnL",123
14932,"We measure, eg the length of different chords that have been put into a state of vibration, with an eye to the qualitative difference of the tones caused by their vibration, corresponding to this difference of length
- EnL",222
14933,"Similarly, in chemistry, we try to ascertain the quantity of the matters brought into combination, in order to find out the measures or proportions conditioning such combinations, that is to say, those quantities which give rise to definite qualities
- EnL",256
14934,"In statistics, too, the numbers with which the study is engaged are important only from the qualitative results conditioned by them
- EnL",137
14935,"Mere collection of numerical facts, prosecuted without regard to the ends here noted, is justly called an exercise of idle curiosity, of neither theoretical nor practical interest
- EnL",185
14936,"Measure is the qualitative quantum, in the first place as immediate,--a quantum, to which a determinate being or a quality is attached
- EnL",140
14937,"Measure, where quality and quantity are in one, is thus the completion of Being
- EnL",85
14938,"Being, as we first apprehend it, is something utterly abstract and characterless: but it is the very essence of Being to characterise itself, and its complete characterisation is reached in Measure
- EnL",203
14939,"Measure, like the other stages of Being, may serve as a definition of the Absolute: God, it has been said, is the Measure of all things
- EnL",141
14941,"To the religious sense of the Greeks the divinity of measure, especially in respect of social ethics, was represented by Nemesis
- EnL",134
14942,"That conception implies a general theory that all human things, riches, honour, and power, as well as joy and pain, have their definite measure, the transgression of which brings ruin and destruction
- EnL",205
14943,"In the world of objects, too, we have measure
- EnL",51
14944,"We see, in the first place, existences in Nature, of which measure forms the essential structure
- EnL",102
14945,"This is the case, for example, with the solar system, which may be described as the realm of free measures
- EnL",112
14946,"As we next proceed to the study of inorganic nature, measure retires, as it were, into the background; at least we often find the quantitative and qualitative characteristics showing indifference to each other
- EnL",215
14947,"Thus the quality of a rock or a river is not tied to a definite magnitude
- EnL",79
14948,"But even these objects when closely inspected are found not to be quite measureless: the water of a river, and the single constituents of a rock, when chemically analysed, are seen to be qualities conditioned by quantitative ratios between the matters they contain
- EnL",270
14949,"In organic nature, however, measure again rises full into immediate perception
- EnL",84
14951,"Thus among fossils, we find some ammonites discernible only by the microscope, and others as large as a cart-wheel
- EnL",120
14952,"The same vagueness of measure appears in several plants, which stand on a low level of organic development,--for instance, ferns
- EnL",134
14953,"In so far as in Measure quality and quantity are only in immediate unity, to that extent their difference presents itself in a manner equally immediate
- EnL",157
14954,"Two cases are then possible
- EnL",33
14955,"Either the specific quantum or measure is a bare quantum, and the definite being (there-and-then) is capable of an increase or a diminution, without Measure (which to that extent is a Rule) being thereby set completely aside
- EnL",230
14956,"Or the alteration of the quantum is also an alteration of the quality
- EnL",75
14957,"The identity between quantity and quality, which is found in Measure, is at first only implicit, and not yet explicitly realised
- EnL",134
14958,"In other words, these two categories, which unite in Measure, each claim an independent authority
- EnL",103
14959,"On the one hand, the quantitative features of existence may be altered, without affecting its quality
- EnL",107
14960,"On the other hand, this increase and diminution, immaterial though it be, has its limit, by exceeding which the quality suffers change
- EnL",140
14962,"A quantitative change takes place, apparently without any further significance: but there is something lurking behind, and a seemingly innocent change of quantity acts as a kind of snare, to catch hold of the quality
- EnL",222
14963,"The antinomy of Measure which this implies was exemplified under more than one garb among the Greeks
- EnL",106
14964,"It was asked, for example, whether a single grain makes a heap of wheat, or whether it makes a bald-tail to tear out a single hair from the horse's tail
- EnL",158
14965,"At first, no doubt, looking at the nature of quantity as an indifferent and external character of Being, we are disposed to answer these questions in the negative
- EnL",168
14966,"And yet, as we must admit, this indifferent increase and diminution has its limit: a point is finally reached, where a single additional grain makes a heap of wheat; and the bald-tail is produced, if we continue plucking out single hairs
- EnL",243
14967,"These examples find a parallel in the story of the peasant who, as his ass trudged cheerfully along, went on adding ounce after ounce to its load, till at length it sunk under the unendurable burden
- EnL",204
14968,"It would be a mistake to treat these examples as pedantic futility; they really turn on thoughts, an acquaintance with which is of great importance in practical life, especially in ethics
- EnL",193
14970,"The same principle may be applied in politics, when the constitution of a state has to be looked at as independent of, no less than as dependent on, the extent of its territory, the number of its inhabitants, and other quantitative points of the same kind
- EnL",261
14973,"The constitution of a little Swiss canton does not suit a great kingdom; and, similarly, the constitution of the Roman republic was unsuitable when transferred to the small imperial towns of Germany
- EnL",204
14974,"In this second case, when a measure through its quantitative nature has gone in excess of its qualitative character, we meet, what is at first an absence of measure, the Measureless
- EnL",187
14975,"But seeing that the second quantitative ratio, which in comparison with the first is measureless, is none the less qualitative, the measureless is also a measure
- EnL",167
14976,"These two transitions, from quality to quantum, and from the latter back again to quality, may be represented under the image of an infinite progression--as the self-abrogation and restoration of measure in the measureless
- EnL",228
14977,"Quantity, as we have seen, is not only capable of alteration, ie of increase or diminution: it is naturally and necessarily a tendency to exceed itself
- EnL",157
14978,"This tendency is maintained even in measure
- EnL",49
14979,"But if the quantity present in measure exceeds a certain limit, the quality corresponding to it is also put in abeyance
- EnL",125
14980,"This however is not a negation of quality altogether, but only of this definite quality, the place of which is at once occupied by another
- EnL",144
14981,"This process of measure, which appears alternately as a mere change in quantity, and then as a sudden revulsion of quantity into quality, may be envisaged under the figure of a nodal (knotted) line
- EnL",203
14982,"Such lines we find in Nature under a variety of forms
- EnL",59
14983,"We have already referred to the qualitatively different states of aggregation water exhibits under increase or diminution of temperature
- EnL",142
14984,"The same phenomenon is presented by the different degrees in the oxidation of metals
- EnL",90
14985,"Even the difference of musical notes may be regarded as an example of what takes place in the process of measure,--the revulsion from what is at first merely quantitative into qualitative alteration
- EnL",204
14986,"In measure, at first, quality and quantity itself are immediate, and measure is only their 'relative' identity
- EnL",116
14987,"But measure shows itself absorbed and superseded in the measureless: yet the measureless, although it be the negation of measure, is itself a unity of quantity and quality
- EnL",177
14988,"Thus in the measureless the measure is still seen to meet only with itself
- EnL",80
14989,"Instead of the more abstract factors, Being and Nothing, some and other, &c, the Infinite, which is affirmation as a negation of negation, now finds its factors in quality and quantity
- EnL",190
14992,"The process of measure, instead of being only the wrong infinite of an endless progression, in the shape of an ever-recurrent recoil from quality to quantity, and from quantity to quality, is also the true infinity of coincidence with self in another
- EnL",256
14993,"In measure, quality and quantity originally confront each other, like some and other
- EnL",90
14994,"But quality is implicitly quantity, and conversely quantity is implicitly quality
- EnL",87
14995,"In the process of measure, therefore, these two pass into each other: each of them becomes what it already was implicitly: and thus we get Being thrown into abeyance and absorbed, with its several characteristics negatived
- EnL",228
14996,"Such Being is Essence
- EnL",27
14997,"Measure is implicitly Essence; and its process consists in realising what it is implicitly--The ordinary consciousness conceives things as being, and studies them in quality, quantity, and measure
- EnL",202
14998,"These immediate characteristics however soon show themselves to be not fixed but transient; and Essence is the result of their dialectic
- EnL",142
14999,"In the sphere of Essence one category does not pass into another, but refers to another merely
- EnL",100
15000,"In Being, the form of reference is purely due to our reflection on what takes place: but it is the special and proper characteristic of Essence
- EnL",149
15001,"In the sphere of Being, when somewhat becomes another, the somewhat has vanished
- EnL",86
15002,"Not so in Essence: here there is no real other, but only diversity, reference of the one to its other
- EnL",107
15003,"The transition of Essence is therefore at the same time no transition: for in the passage of different into different, the different does not vanish: the different terms remain in their relation
- EnL",200
15004,"When we speak of Being and Nought, Being is independent, so is Nought
- EnL",75
15005,"The case is otherwise with the Positive and the Negative
- EnL",62
15006,"No doubt these possess the characteristic of Being and Nought
- EnL",67
15007,"But the positive by itself has no sense; it is wholly in reference to the negative
- EnL",88
15008,"And it is the same with the negative
- EnL",42
15009,"In the sphere of Being the reference of one term to another is only implicit; in Essence on the contrary it is explicit And this in general is the distinction between the forms of Being and Essence: in Being everything is immediate, in Essence everything is relative
- EnL",272
15010,"The terms in Essence are always mere pairs of correlatives, and not yet absolutely reflected in themselves: hence in essence the actual unity of the notion is not realised, but only postulated by reflection
- EnL",212
15012,"The Absolute is the Essence
- EnL",33
15013,"This is the same definition as the previous one that the Absolute is Being, in so far as Being likewise is simple self-relation
- EnL",133
15015,"This negative action of withdrawal or abstraction thus falls outside of the Essence--which is thus left as a mere result apart from its premisses,--the caput mortuum of abstraction
- EnL",186
15016,"But as this negativity, instead of being external to Being, is its own dialectic, the truth of the latter, viz Essence, will be Being as retired within itself,--immanent Being
- EnL",181
15017,"That reflection, or light thrown into itself, constitutes the distinction between Essence and immediate Being, and is the peculiar characteristic of Essence itself
- EnL",169
15018,"But this seeming is not an utter nonentity and nothing at all, but Being superseded and put by
- EnL",100
15019,"The point of view given by the Essence is in general the standpoint of 'Reflection'
- EnL",89
15020,"This word 'reflection' is originally applied, when a ray of light in a straight line impinging upon the surface of a mirror is thrown back from it
- EnL",152
15022,"The problem or aim of philosophy is often represented as the ascertainment of the essence of things: a phrase which only means that things instead of being left in their immediacy, must be shown to be mediated by, or based upon, something else
- EnL",249
15023,"The immediate Being of things is thus conceived under the image of a rind or curtain behind which the Essence lies hidden
- EnL",127
15024,"Everything, it is said, has an Essence; that is, things really are not what they immediately show themselves
- EnL",114
15025,"There is therefore something more to be done than merely rove from one quality to another, and merely to advance from qualitative to quantitative, and vice versâ: there is a permanent in things, and that permanent is in the first instance their Essence
- EnL",258
15026,"With respect to other meanings and uses of the category of Essence, we may note that in the German auxiliary verb 'sein' the past tense is expressed by the term for Essence (Wesen): we designate past being as gewesen
- EnL",222
15027,"This anomaly of language implies to some extent a correct perception of the relation between Being and Essence
- EnL",116
15028,"Essence we may certainly regard as past Being, remembering however meanwhile that the past is not utterly denied, but only laid aside and thus at the same time preserved
- EnL",175
15029,"Thus, to say, Caesar was in Gaul, only denies the immediacy of the event, but not his sojourn in Gaul altogether
- EnL",118
15030,"That sojourn is just what forms the import of the proposition, in which however it is represented as over and gone--'Wesen' in ordinary life frequently means only a collection or aggregate: Zeitungswesen (the Press), Postwesen (the Post-Office), Steuerwesen (the Revenue)
- EnL",277
15031,"All that these terms mean is that the things in question are not to be taken single, in their immediacy, but as a complex, and then, perhaps, in addition, in their various bearings
- EnL",186
15032,"This usage of the term is not very different in its implication from our own
- EnL",82
15033,"People also speak of finite Essences, such as man
- EnL",55
15034,"But the very term Essence implies that we have made a step beyond finitude: and the title as applied to man is so far inexact
- EnL",131
15035,"It is often added that there is a supreme Essence (Being): by which is meant God
- EnL",86
15036,"On this two remarks may be made
- EnL",37
15037,"In the first place the phrase 'there is' suggests a finite only: as when we say, there are so many planets, or, there are plants of such a constitution and plants of such an other
- EnL",185
15038,"In these cases we are speaking of something which has other things beyond and beside it
- EnL",93
15039,"But God, the absolutely infinite, is not something outside and beside whom there are other essences
- EnL",105
15040,"All else outside f God, if separated from Him, possesses no essentiality: in its I isolation it becomes a mere show or seeming, without stay or essence of its own
- EnL",168
15041,"But, secondly, it is a poor way of talking to call God the highest or supreme Essence
- EnL",91
15042,"The category of quantity which the phrase employs has its proper place within the compass of the finite
- EnL",109
15043,"When we call one mountain the highest on the earth, we have a vision of other high mountains beside it
- EnL",108
15044,"So too when we call any one the richest or most learned in his country
- EnL",76
15045,"But God, far from being a Being, even the highest, is the Being
- EnL",69
15046,"This definition, however, though such a representation of God is an important and necessary stage in the growth of the religious consciousness, does not by any means exhaust the depth of the ordinary Christian idea of God
- EnL",227
15047,"If we consider God as the Essence only, and nothing more, we know Him only as the universal and irresistible Power; in other words, as the Lord
- EnL",149
15048,"Now the fear of the Lord is, doubtless, the beginning,--but only the beginning, of wisdom
- EnL",95
15049,"To look at God in this light, as the Lord, and the Lord alone, is especially characteristic of Judaism and also of Mohammedanism
- EnL",134
15050,"The defect of these religions lies in their scant recognition of the finite, which, be it as natural things or as finite phases of mind, it is characteristic of the heathen and (as they also for that reason are) polytheistic religions to maintain intact
- EnL",259
15051,"Another not uncommon assertion is that God, as the supreme Being, cannot be known
- EnL",87
15052,"Such is the view taken by modern 'enlightenment' and abstract understanding, which is content to say, Il y a un être suprême: and there lets the matter rest
- EnL",162
15053,"To speak thus, and treat God merely as the supreme other-world Being, implies that we look upon the world before us in its immediacy as something permanent and positive, and forget that true Being is just the superseding of all that is immediate
- EnL",251
15054,"If God be the abstract super-sensible Being, outside whom therefore lies all difference and all specific character, He is only a bare name, a mere caput mortuum of abstracting understanding
- EnL",195
15055,"The true knowledge of God begins when we know that things, as they immediately are, have no truth
- EnL",103
15056,"In reference also to other subjects besides God the category of Essence is often liable to an abstract use, by which, in the study of anything, its Essence is held to be something unaffected by, and subsisting in independence of, its definite phenomenal embodiment
- EnL",270
15057,"Thus we say, for example, of people, that the great thing is not what they do or how they behave, but what they are
- EnL",121
15058,"This is correct, if it means that a man's conduct should be looked at, not in its immediacy, but only as it is explained by his inner self, and as a revelation of that inner self
- EnL",184
15060,"Self-relation in Essence is the form of Identity or of reflection-into-self, which has here taken the place of the immediacy of Being
- EnL",139
15061,"They are both the same abstraction,--self-relation
- EnL",56
15062,"The unintelligence of sense, to take everything limited and finite for Being, passes into the obstinacy of understanding, which views the finite as self-identical, not inherently self-contradictory
- EnL",203
15063,"This identity, as it has descended from Being, appears in the first place only charged with the characteristics of Being, and referred to Being as to something external
- EnL",174
15064,"This external Being, if taken in separation from the true Being (of Essence), is called the Unessential
- EnL",109
15065,"But that turns out a mistake
- EnL",34
15066,"Because Essence is Being-in-self, it is essential only to the extent that it has in itself its negative, e reference to another, or mediation
- EnL",147
15067,"Consequently, it has the unessential as its own proper seeming (reflection) in itself
- EnL",91
15069,"The sphere of Essence thus turns out to be a still imperfect combination of immediacy and mediation
- EnL",105
15070,"In it every term is expressly invested with the character of self-relatedness, while yet at the same time one is forced beyond it
- EnL",135
15071,"It has Being,--reflected being, a being in which another shows, and which shows in another
- EnL",96
15072,"And so it is also the sphere in which the contradiction, still implicit in the sphere of Being, is made explicit
- EnL",118
15073,"As the one notion is the common principle underlying all logic, there appear in the development of Essence the same attributes or terms as in the development of Being, but in a reflex form
- EnL",194
15074,"Instead of Being and Nought we have now the forms of Positive and Negative; the former at first as Identity corresponding to pure and uncontrasted Being, the latter developed (showing in itself) as Difference
- EnL",214
15075,"So also, we have Becoming represented by the Ground of determinate Being: which itself, when reflected upon the Ground, is Existence
- EnL",138
15076,"The theory of Essence is the most difficult branch of Logic
- EnL",65
15077,"It includes the categories of metaphysic and of the sciences in general
- EnL",77
15079,"The Essence lights up in itself or is mere reflection: and therefore is only self-relation, not as immediate but as reflected
- EnL",131
15080,"And that reflex relation is self-Identity
- EnL",47
15081,"This Identity becomes an Identity in form only, or of the understanding, if it be held hard and fast, quite aloof from difference
- EnL",135
15082,"Or, rather, abstraction is the imposition of this Identity of form, the transformation of something inherently concrete into this form of elementary simplicity
- EnL",165
15083,"And this may be done in two ways
- EnL",38
15084,"Either we may neglect a part of the multiple features which are found in the concrete thing (by what is called analysis) and select only one of them; or, neglecting their variety, we may concentrate the multiple characters into one
- EnL",237
15085,"If we associate Identity with the Absolute, making the Absolute the subject of a proposition, we get: The Absolute is what is identical with itself
- EnL",153
15086,"However true this proposition may be, it is doubtful whether it be meant in its truth: and therefore it is at least imperfect in the expression
- EnL",149
15087,"For it is left undecided, whether it means the abstract Identity of understanding,--abstract, that is, because contrasted with the other characteristics of Essence, or the Identity which is inherently concrete
- EnL",215
15088,"In the latter case, as will be seen, true Identity is first discoverable in the Ground, and, with a higher truth, in the Notion--Even the word Absolute is often used to mean no more than 'abstract'
- EnL",203
15089,"Absolute space and absolute time, for example, is another way of saying abstract space and abstract time
- EnL",110
15090,"Thus the first of them, the maxim of Identity, reads: Everything is identical with itself, A=A: and, negatively, A cannot at the same time be A and not A--This maxim, instead of being a true law of thought, is nothing but the law of abstract understanding
- EnL",261
15091,"The propositional form itself contradicts it: for a proposition always promises a distinction between subject and predicate; while the present one does not fulfil what its form requires
- EnL",191
15093,"To this alleged experience of the logic-books may be opposed the universal experience that no mind thinks or forms conceptions or speaks, in accordance with this law, and that no existence of any kind whatever conforms to it
- EnL",230
15094,"Utterances after the fashion of this pretended law (A planet is--a planet; Magnetism is--magnetism; Mind is--mind) are, as they deserve to be, reputed silly
- EnL",162
15095,"That is certainly matter of general experience
- EnL",52
15096,"The logic which seriously propounds such laws and the scholastic world in which alone they are valid have long been discredited with practical common sense as well as with the philosophy of reason
- EnL",202
15097,"It is therefore Being as Ideality--It is important to come to a proper understanding on the true meaning of Identity: and, for that purpose, we must especially guard against taking it as abstract Identity, to the exclusion of all Difference
- EnL",246
15098,"That is the touchstone for distinguishing all bad philosophy from what alone deserves the name of philosophy
- EnL",114
15099,"Identity in its truth, as an Ideality of what immediately is, is a high category for our religious modes of mind as well as all other forms of thought and mental activity
- EnL",176
15100,"The true knowledge of God, it may be said, begins when we know Him as identity,--as absolute identity
- EnL",107
15101,"To know so much is to see that all the power and glory of the world sinks into nothing in God's presence, and subsists only as the reflection of His power and His glory
- EnL",174
15102,"In the same way, Identity, as self-consciousness, is what distinguishes man from nature, particularly from the brutes which never reach the point of comprehending themselves as 'I,' that is, pure self-contained unity
- EnL",222
15103,"So again, in connexion with thought, the main thing is not to confuse the true Identity, which contains Being and its characteristics ideally transfigured in it, with an abstract Identity, identity of bare form
- EnL",216
15104,"All the charges of narrowness, hardness, meaninglessness, which are so often directed against thought from the quarter of feeling and immediate perception, rest on the perverse assumption that thought acts only as a faculty of abstract Identification
- EnL",256
15105,"The Formal Logic itself confirms this assumption by laying down the supreme law of thought (so-called) which has been discussed above
- EnL",139
15106,"If thinking were no more than an abstract Identity, we could not but own it to be a most futile and tedious business
- EnL",122
15107,"No doubt the notion, and the idea too, are identical with themselves: but identical only in so far as they at the same time involve distinction
- EnL",149
15108,"Essence is mere Identity and reflection in itself only as it is self-relating negativity, and in that way self-repulsion
- EnL",126
15109,"It contains therefore essentially the characteristic of Difference
- EnL",72
15110,"Other-being is here no longer qualitative, taking the shape of the character or limit
- EnL",91
15111,"It is now in Essence, in self-relating essence, and therefore the negation is at the same time a relation,--is, in short, Distinction, Relativity, Mediation
- EnL",162
15112,"To ask, 'How Identity comes to Difference,' assumes that Identity as mere abstract Identity is something of itself, and Difference also something else equally independent
- EnL",176
15113,"This supposition renders an answer to the question impossible
- EnL",67
15115,"The question then when put to the test has obviously no meaning, and its proposer may be met with the question what he means by Identity; whereupon we should soon see that he attaches no idea to it at all, and that Identity is for him an empty name
- EnL",254
15116,"As we have seen, besides, Identity is undoubtedly a negative,--not however an abstract empty Nought, but the negation of Being and its characteristics
- EnL",156
15117,"Being so, Identity is at the same time self-relation, and, what is more, negative self-relation; in other words, it draws a distinction between it and itself
- EnL",163
15118,"Difference is, first of all, (1) immediate difference, eg Diversity or Variety
- EnL",84
15119,"In Diversity the different things are each individually what they are, and unaffected by the relation in which they stand to each other
- EnL",141
15120,"This relation is therefore external to them
- EnL",49
15121,"In consequence of the various things being thus indifferent to the difference between them, it falls outside them into a third thing, the agent of Comparison
- EnL",163
15122,"This external difference, as an identity of the objects related, is Likeness; as a non-identity of them, is Unlikeness
- EnL",124
15124,"Diversity has, like Identity, been transformed into a maxim: 'Everything is various or different': or,'There are no two things completely like each other'
- EnL",160
15125,"Here Everything is put under a predicate, which is the reverse of the identity attributed to it in the first maxim; and therefore under a law contradicting the first
- EnL",171
15126,"However there is an explanation
- EnL",37
15127,"As the diversity is supposed due only to external comparison, anything taken per se is expected and understood always to be identical with itself, so that the second law need not interfere with the first
- EnL",209
15128,"But, in that case, variety does not belong to the something or everything in question: it constitutes no intrinsic characteristic of the subject: and the second maxim on this showing does not admit of being stated at all
- EnL",226
15129,"If, on the other hand, the something itself is as the maxim says diverse, it must be in virtue of its own proper character: but in this case the specific difference, and not variety as such, is what is intended
- EnL",216
15130,"And this is the meaning of the maxim of Leibnitz
- EnL",54
15131,"If we follow the so-called law of Identity, and say,--The sea is the sea, The air is the air, The moon is the moon, these objects pass for having no bearing on one another
- EnL",177
15132,"What we have before us therefore is not Identity, but Difference
- EnL",70
15133,"We do not stop at this point however, or regard things merely as different
- EnL",80
15134,"The work of the finite sciences lies to a great extent in the application of these categories, and the phrase 'scientific treatment' generally means no more than the method which has for its aim comparison of the objects under examination
- EnL",244
15135,"This method has undoubtedly led to some important results;--we may particularly mention the great advance of modern times in the provinces of comparative anatomy and comparative linguistic
- EnL",194
15136,"But it is going too far to suppose that the comparative method can be employed with equal success in all branches of knowledge
- EnL",132
15137,"Nor--and this must be emphasised--can mere comparison ever ultimately satisfy the requirements of science
- EnL",111
15138,"Its results are indeed indispensable, but they are still labours only preliminary to truly intelligent cognition
- EnL",118
15139,"If it be the office of comparison to reduce existing differences to Identity, the science, which most perfectly fulfils that end, is mathematics
- EnL",150
15140,"The reason of that is, that quantitative difference is only the difference which is quite external
- EnL",104
15141,"Thus, in geometry, a triangle and a quadrangle, figures qualitatively different, have this qualitative difference discounted by abstraction, and are equalised to one another in magnitude
- EnL",192
15142,"It follows from what has been formerly said about the mere Identity of understanding that, as has also been pointed out (§ 99, note), neither philosophy nor the empirical sciences need envy this superiority of Mathematics
- EnL",227
15143,"The story is told that, when Leibnitz propounded the maxim of Variety, the cavaliers and ladies of the court, as they walked round the garden, made efforts to discover two leaves indistinguishable from each other, in order to confute the law stated by the philosopher
- EnL",273
15144,"Their device was unquestionably a convenient method of dealing with metaphysics,--one which has not ceased to be fashionable
- EnL",130
15145,"All the same, as regards the principle of Leibnitz, difference must be understood to mean not an external and indifferent diversity merely, but difference essential
- EnL",170
15146,"Hence the very nature of things implies that they must be different
- EnL",73
15147,"Likeness is an Identity only of those things which are not the same, not identical with each other: and Unlikeness is a relation of things unlike
- EnL",151
15148,"The two therefore do not fall on different aspects or points of view in the thing, without any mutual affinity: but one throws light into the other
- EnL",153
15149,"Variety thus comes to be reflexive difference, or difference (distinction) implicit and essential, determinate or specific difference
- EnL",139
15150,"The one of them cannot be thought without the other
- EnL",57
15151,"This advance from simple variety to opposition appears in our common acts of thought, when we allow that comparison has a meaning only upon the hypothesis of an existing difference, and that on the other hand we can distinguish only on the hypothesis of existing similarity
- EnL",279
15153,"In the case of difference, in short, we like to sec identity, and in the case of identity we like to see difference
- EnL",121
15154,"Within the range of the empirical sciences however, the one of these two categories is often allowed to put the other out of sight and mind
- EnL",145
15155,"Thus the scientific problem at one time is to reduce existing differences to identity; on another occasion, with equal one-sidedness, to discover new differences
- EnL",167
15156,"We see this especially in physical science
- EnL",48
15157,"There the problem consists, in the first place, in the continual search for new 'elements,' new forces, new genera, and species
- EnL",133
15158,"Or, in another direction, it seeks to show that all bodies hitherto believed to be simple are compound: and modern physicists and chemists smile at the ancients, who were satisfied with four elements, and these not simple
- EnL",227
15159,"Secondly, and on the other hand, mere identity is made the chief question
- EnL",79
15160,"Thus electricity and chemical affinity are regarded as the same, and even the organic processes of digestion and assimilation are looked upon as a mere chemical operation
- EnL",176
15161,"Modern philosophy has often been nicknamed the Philosophy of Identity
- EnL",75
15163,"Difference implicit is essential difference, the Positive and the Negative: and that is this way
- EnL",102
15164,"The Positive is the identical self-relation in such a way as not to be the Negative, and the Negative is the different by itself so as not to be the Positive
- EnL",163
15165,"Thus either has an existence of its own in proportion as it is not the other
- EnL",82
15166,"The one is made visible in the other, and is only in so far as that other is
- EnL",82
15167,"Essential difference is therefore Opposition; according to which the different is not confronted by any other but by its other
- EnL",132
15168,"That is, either of these two (Positive and Negative) is stamped with a characteristic of its own only in its relation to the other: the one is only reflected into itself as it is reflected into the other
- EnL",209
15169,"And so with the other
- EnL",27
15170,"Either in this way is the other's own other
- EnL",49
15171,"Difference implicit or essential gives the maxim, Everything is essentially distinct; or, as it has also been expressed, Of two opposite predicates the one only can be assigned to anything, and there is no third possible
- EnL",226
15172,"This maxim of Contrast or Opposition most expressly controverts the maxim of Identity: the one says a thing should be only self-relation, the other says that it must be an opposite, a relation to its other
- EnL",211
15174,"A must be either  A or - A, it says
- EnL",41
15175,"It virtually declares in these words a third A which is neither  nor--, and which at the same time is yet invested with  and - characters
- EnL",143
15176,"If  W mean 6 miles to the West, and - W mean 6 miles to the East, and if the  and - cancel each other, the 6 miles of way or space remain what they were with and without the contrast
- EnL",188
15178,"This other then would not be an affirmative, say, yellow, but would merely be kept at the abstract negative--That the Negative in its own nature is quite as much Positive (see next §), is implied in saying that what is opposite to another is its other
- EnL",257
15179,"The inanity of the opposition between what are called contradictory notions is fully exhibited in what we may call the grandiose formula of a general law, that Everything has the one and not the other of all predicates which are in such opposition
- EnL",253
15180,"In this way, mind is either white or not-white, yellow or not-yellow, &c, ad infinitum
- EnL",92
15181,"It was forgotten that Identity and Opposition are themselves opposed, and the maxim of Opposition was taken even for that of Identity, in the shape of the principle of Contradiction
- EnL",187
15182,"A notion, which possesses neither or both of two mutually contradictory marks, eg a quadrangular circle, is held to be logically false
- EnL",140
15183,"Now though a multangular circle and a rectilineal arc no less contradict this maxim, geometers never hesitate to treat the circle as a polygon with rectilineal sides
- EnL",171
15184,"But anything like a circle (that is to say its mere character or nominal definition) is still no notion
- EnL",109
15185,"In the notion of a circle, centre and circumference are equally essential: both marks belong to it: and yet centre and circumference are opposite and contradictory to each other
- EnL",183
15186,"The conception of Polarity, which is so dominant in physics, contains by implication the more correct definition of Opposition
- EnL",132
15187,"But physics for its theory of the laws of thought adheres to the ordinary logic; it might therefore well be horrified in case it should ever work out the conception of Polarity, and get at the thoughts which are implied in it
- EnL",231
15188,"The negative per se is the same as difference itself
- EnL",58
15189,"The identical as such is primarily the yet uncharacterised: the positive on the other hand is what is self-identical, but with the mark of antithesis to an other
- EnL",167
15190,"And the negative is difference as such, characterised as not identity
- EnL",75
15191,"This is the difference of difference within its own self
- EnL",62
15192,"Positive and negative are supposed to express an absolute difference
- EnL",74
15193,"The two however are at bottom the same: the name of either might be transferred to the other
- EnL",98
15194,"Thus, for example, debts and assets are not two particular, self-subsisting species of property
- EnL",101
15195,"What is negative to the debtor, is positive to the creditor
- EnL",65
15196,"A way to the east is also a way to the west
- EnL",49
15197,"Positive and negative are therefore intrinsically conditioned by one another, and are only in relation to each other
- EnL",122
15198,"The north pole of the magnet cannot be without the south pole, and vice versâ
- EnL",83
15199,"If we cut a magnet in two, we have not a north pole in one piece, and a south pole in the other
- EnL",101
15200,"Similarly, in electricity, the positive and the negative are not two diverse and independent fluids
- EnL",105
15201,"In opposition, the different is not confronted by any other, but by its other
- EnL",83
15202,"Usually we regard different things as unaffected by each other
- EnL",68
15203,"Thus we say: I am a human being, and around me are air, water, animals, and all sorts of things
- EnL",101
15204,"Everything is thus put outside of every other
- EnL",51
15205,"But the aim of philosophy is to banish indifference, and to ascertain the necessity of things
- EnL",99
15206,"By that means the other is seen to stand over against its other
- EnL",69
15207,"Thus, for example, inorganic nature is not to be considered merely something else than organic nature, but the necessary antithesis of it
- EnL",143
15208,"Both are in essential relation to one another; and the one of the two is, only in so far as it excludes the other from it, and thus relates itself thereto
- EnL",160
15209,"Nature in like manner is not without mind, nor mind without nature
- EnL",72
15210,"An important step has been taken, when we cease in thinking to use phrases like: Of course something else is also possible
- EnL",128
15211,"In modern physical science the opposition, first observed to exist in magnetism as polarity, has come to be regarded as a universal law pervading the whole of nature
- EnL",171
15212,"This would be a real scientific advance, if care were at the same time taken not to let mere variety revert without explanation, as a valid category, side by side with opposition
- EnL",184
15214,"Neither in heaven nor in earth, neither in the world of mind nor of nature, is there anywhere such an abstract 'Either--or' as the understanding maintains
- EnL",160
15215,"Whatever exists is concrete, with difference and opposition in itself
- EnL",75
15216,"The finitude of things will then lie in the want of correspondence between their immediate being, and what they essentially are
- EnL",133
15217,"Thus, in inorganic nature, the acid is implicitly at the same time the base: in other words, its only being consists in its relation to its other
- EnL",151
15218,"Hence also the acid is not something that persists quietly in the contrast: it is always in effort to realise what it potentially is
- EnL",138
15219,"Contradiction is the very moving principle of the world: and it is ridiculous to say that contradiction is unthinkable
- EnL",124
15220,"The only thing correct in that statement is that contradiction is not the end of the matter, but cancels itself
- EnL",117
15221,"But contradiction, when cancelled, does not leave abstract identity; for that is itself only one side of the contrariety
- EnL",126
15222,"The proximate result of opposition (when realised as contradiction) is the Ground, which contains identity as well as difference superseded and deposed to elements in the completer notion
- EnL",193
15223,"Contrariety then has two forms
- EnL",36
15224,"The Positive is the aforesaid various (different) which is understood to be independent, and yet at the same not to be unaffected by its relation to its other
- EnL",164
15225,"The Negative is to be, no less independently, negative self-relating, self-subsistent, and yet at the same time as Negative must on every point have this its self-relation, ie its Positive, only in the other
- EnL",213
15226,"Both Positive and Negative are therefore explicit contradiction; both are potentially the same
- EnL",100
15227,"Both are so actually also; since either is the abrogation of the other and of itself
- EnL",90
15228,"Thus they fall to the Ground--Or as is plain, the essential difference, as a difference, is only the difference of it from itself, and thus contains the identical: so that to essential and actual difference there belongs itself as well as identity
- EnL",253
15229,"As self-relating difference it is likewise virtually enunciated as the self-identical
- EnL",91
15230,"And the opposite is in general that which includes the one and its other, itself and its opposite
- EnL",103
15231,"The immanence of essence thus defined is the Ground
- EnL",57
15232,"The Ground is the unity of identity and difference, the truth of what difference and identity have turned out to be,--the reflection-into-self, which is equally a reflection-into-an-other, and vice versâ
- EnL",209
15233,"It is essence put explicitly as a totality
- EnL",48
15235,"And to this extent the essence is not abstract reflection into self, but into an other
- EnL",92
15236,"The Ground is the essence in its own inwardness; the essence is intrinsically a ground; and it is a ground only when it is a ground of somewhat, of an other
- EnL",162
15237,"We must be careful, when we say that the ground is the unity of identity and difference, not to understand by this unity an abstract identity
- EnL",147
15238,"Otherwise we only change the name, while we still think the identity (of understanding) already seen to be false
- EnL",118
15239,"To avoid this misconception we may say that the ground, besides being the unity, is also the difference of identity and difference
- EnL",136
15240,"In that case in the ground, which promised at first to supersede contradiction, a new contradiction seems to arise
- EnL",120
15241,"It is however a contradiction which, so far from persisting quietly in itself, is rather the expulsion of it from itself
- EnL",126
15242,"The ground is a ground only to the extent that it affords ground: but the result which thus issued from the ground is only itself
- EnL",135
15243,"In this lies its formalism
- EnL",32
15244,"The ground and what is grounded are one and the same content: the difference between the two is the mere difference of form which separates simple self-relation, on the one hand, from mediation or derivativeness on the other
- EnL",230
15245,"Inquiry into the grounds of things goes with the point of view which, as already noted (note to § 112), is adopted by Reflection
- EnL",134
15246,"We wish, as it were, to see the matter double, first in its immediacy, and secondly in its ground, where it is no longer immediate
- EnL",136
15247,"This is the plain meaning of the law of sufficient ground, as it is called; it asserts that things should essentially be viewed as mediated
- EnL",145
15248,"The manner in which Formal Logic establishes this law of thought, sets a bad example to other sciences
- EnL",108
15249,"Formal Logic asks these sciences not to accept their subject-matter as it is immediately given; and yet herself lays down a law of thought without deducing it,--in other words, without exhibiting its mediation
- EnL",215
15250,"Yet even if logic be excused the duty of giving a ground for the law of the sufficient ground, it might at least explain what is to be understood by a ground
- EnL",163
15251,"The common explanation, which describes the ground as what has a consequence, seems at the first glance more lucid and intelligible than the preceding definition in logical terms
- EnL",184
15252,"If you ask however what the consequence is, you are told that it is what has a ground; and it becomes obvious that the explanation is intelligible only because it assumes what in our case has been reached as the termination of an antecedent movement of thought
- EnL",266
15253,"And this is the true business of logic: to show that those thoughts, which as usually employed merely float before consciousness neither understood nor demonstrated, are really grades in the self-determination of thought
- EnL",226
15254,"It is by this means that they are understood and demonstrated
- EnL",67
15255,"In common life, and it is the same in the finite sciences, this reflective form is often employed as a key to the secret of the real condition of the objects under investigation
- EnL",183
15256,"So long as we deal with what may be termed the household needs of knowledge, nothing can be urged against this method of study
- EnL",132
15257,"But it can never afford definitive satisfaction, either in theory or practice
- EnL",83
15258,"And the reason why it fails is that the ground is yet without a definite content of its own; I so that to regard anything as resting upon a ground merely gives the formal difference of mediation in place of immediacy
- EnL",222
15259,"What is this but the same content as we had immediately before us, only translated into the form of inwardness?
- EnL",117
15260,"The ground however is not merely simple self-identity, but also different: hence various grounds may be alleged for the same sum of fact
- EnL",142
15261,"This variety of grounds, again, following the logic of difference, culminates in opposition of grounds pro and contra
- EnL",123
15262,"In any action, such as a theft, there is a sum of fact in which several aspects may be distinguished
- EnL",106
15263,"The theft has violated the rights of property: it has given the means of satisfying his wants to the needy thief: possibly too the man, from whom the theft was made, misused his property
- EnL",192
15264,"The violation of property is unquestionably the decisive point of view before which the others must give way: but the bare law of the ground cannot settle that question
- EnL",174
15266,"But here comes a dilemma
- EnL",30
15267,"If we use the phrase 'sufficient ground,' the epithet is either otiose, or of such a kind as to carry us past the mere category of ground
- EnL",143
15268,"The predicate is otiose and tautological, if it only states the capability of giving a ground or reason: for the ground is a ground, only in so far as it has this capability
- EnL",179
15269,"If a soldier runs away from battle to save his life, his conduct is certainly a violation of duty: but it cannot be held that the ground which led him so to act was insufficient, otherwise he would have remained at his post
- EnL",229
15270,"Besides, there is this also to be said
- EnL",44
15271,"On one hand any ground suffices: on the other no ground suffices as mere ground; because, as already said, it is yet void of a content objectively and intrinsically determined, and is therefore not self-acting and productive
- EnL",230
15272,"A content thus objectively and intrinsically determined, and hence self-acting, will hereafter come before us as the notion: and it is the notion which Leibnitz had in his eye when he spoke of sufficient ground, and urged the study of things under its point of view
- EnL",271
15273,"His remarks were originally directed against that merely mechanical method of conceiving things so much in vogue even now; a method which he justly pronounces insufficient
- EnL",177
15274,"It is unfair to Leibnitz to suppose that he was content with anything so poor as this formal law of the ground
- EnL",116
15275,"The method of investigation which he inaugurated is the very reverse of a formalism which acquiesces in mere grounds, where a full and concrete knowledge is sought
- EnL",169
15276,"Considerations to this effect led Leibnitz to contrast causae efficientes and causae finales, and to insist in the place of final causes as the conception to which the efficient were to lead up
- EnL",199
15277,"If we adopt this distinction, light, heat, and moisture would be the causae efficientes, not the causa finalis of the growth of plants: the causa finalis is the notion of the plant itself
- EnL",193
15278,"To get no further than mere grounds, especially on questions of law and morality, is the position and principle of the Sophists
- EnL",133
15279,"Sophistry, as we ordinarily conceive it, is a method of investigation which aims at distorting what is just and true, and exhibiting things in a false light
- EnL",162
15280,"Such however is not the proper or primary tendency of Sophistry: the standpoint of which is no other than that of 'Raisonnement'
- EnL",134
15281,"The Sophists came on the scene at a time when the Greeks had begun to grow dissatisfied with mere authority and tradition and felt the need of intellectual justification for what they were to accept as obligatory
- EnL",218
15282,"That desideratum the Sophists supplied by teaching their countrymen to seek for the various points of view under which things may be considered: which points of view are the same as grounds
- EnL",195
15283,"But the ground, as we have seen, has no essential and objective principles of its own, and it is as easy to discover grounds for what is wrong and immoral as for what is moral and right
- EnL",191
15284,"Upon the observer therefore it depends to decide what points are to have most weight
- EnL",90
15285,"The decision in such circumstances is prompted by his individual views and sentiments
- EnL",91
15286,"Thus the objective foundation of what ought to have been of absolute and essential obligation, accepted by all, was undermined: and Sophistry by this destructive action deservedly brought upon itself the bad name previously mentioned
- EnL",239
15288,"In the present day such a method of argumentation is not quite out of fashion
- EnL",83
15289,"Nor is that the case only in the discussion of secular matters
- EnL",68
15290,"It occurs even in sermons, such as those where every possible ground of gratitude to God is propounded
- EnL",108
15291,"To such pleading Socrates and Plato would not have scrupled to apply the name of Sophistry
- EnL",96
15292,"For Sophistry has nothing to do with what is taught:--that may very possibly be true
- EnL",90
15293,"Sophistry lies in the formal circumstance of teaching it by grounds which are as available for attack as for defence
- EnL",122
15294,"In a time so rich in reflection and so devoted to raisonnement as our own, he must be a poor creature who cannot advance a good ground for everything, even for what is worst and most depraved
- EnL",197
15295,"Everything in the world that has become corrupt has had good ground for its corruption
- EnL",92
15296,"An appeal to grounds at first makes the hearer think of beating a retreat: but when experience has taught him the real state of these matters, he closes his ears against them, and refuses to be imposed upon any more
- EnL",221
15297,"As it first comes, the chief feature of Essence is show in itself and intermediation in itself
- EnL",100
15298,"But when it has completed the circle of intermediation, its unity with itself is explicitly put as the self-annulling of difference, and therefore of intermediation
- EnL",170
15299,"Once more then we come back to immediacy or Being,--but Being in so far as it is intermediated by annulling the intermediation
- EnL",132
15300,"And that Being is Existence
- EnL",33
15301,"The ground is not yet determined by objective principles of its own, nor is it an end or final cause: hence it is not active, nor productive
- EnL",146
15302,"An Existence only proceeds from the ground
- EnL",48
15303,"The determinate ground is therefore a formal matter: that is to say, any point will do, so long as it is expressly put as self-relation, as affirmation, in correlation with the immediate existence depending on it
- EnL",218
15304,"If it be a ground at all, it is a good ground: for the term 'good' is employed abstractly as equivalent to affirmative; and any point (or feature) is good which can in any way be enunciated as confessedly affirmative
- EnL",222
15305,"So it happens that a ground can be found and adduced for everything: and a good ground (for example, a good motive for action) may effect something or may not, it may have a consequence or it may not
- EnL",205
15306,"It becomes a motive (strictly so called) and effects something, eg through its reception into a will; there and there only it becomes active and is made a cause
- EnL",166
15307,"Existence is the immediate unity of reflection-into-self and reflection-into-another
- EnL",90
15309,"The grounds are themselves existences: and the existents in like manner are in many directions grounds as well as consequents
- EnL",131
15310,"The phrase 'Existence' (derived from existere) suggests the fact of having proceeded from something
- EnL",105
15311,"Existence is Being which has proceeded from the ground, and been reinstated by annulling its intermediation
- EnL",113
15312,"The Essence, as Being set aside and absorbed, originally came before us as shining or showing in self, and the categories of this reflection are identity, difference and ground
- EnL",182
15313,"The last is the unity of identity and difference; and because it unifies them it has at the same time to distinguish itself from itself
- EnL",141
15314,"But that which is in this way distinguished from the ground is as little mere difference, as the ground itself is abstract sameness
- EnL",137
15315,"The ground works its own suspension: and when suspended, the result of its negation is existence
- EnL",102
15316,"Having issued from the ground, existence contains the ground in it 'the ground does not remain, as it were, behind existence, but by its very nature supersedes itself and translates itself into existence
- EnL",209
15317,"This is exemplified even in our ordinary mode of thinking, when we look upon the ground of a thing, not as something abstractly inward, but as itself also an existent
- EnL",172
15318,"For example, the lightning-flash which has set a house on fire would be considered the ground of the conflagration: or the manners of a nation and the condition of its life would be regarded as the ground of its constitution
- EnL",230
15319,"Such indeed is the ordinary aspect in which the existent world originally appears to reflection,--an indefinite crowd of things existent, which being simultaneously reflected on themselves and on one another are related reciprocally as ground and consequence
- EnL",264
15320,"In this motley play of the world, if we may so call the sum of existents, there is nowhere a firm footing to be found: everything bears an aspect of relativity, conditioned by and conditioning something else
- EnL",213
15322,"The reflection-on-another of the existent is however inseparable from the reflection-on-self: the ground is their unity, from which existence has issued
- EnL",158
15323,"The existent therefore includes relativity, and has on its own part its multiple interconnexions with other existents: it is reflected on itself as its ground
- EnL",164
15324,"The existent is, when so described, a Thing
- EnL",49
15325,"The 'thing-by-itself' (or thing in the abstract), so famous in the philosophy of Kant, shows itself here in its genesis
- EnL",125
15326,"It is seen to be the abstract reflection-on-self, which is clung to, to the exclusion of reflection-on-other-things and of all predication of difference
- EnL",158
15327,"The thing-by-itself therefore is the empty substratum for these predicates of relation
- EnL",92
15328,"If to know means to comprehend an object in its concrete character, then the thing-by-itself, which is nothing but the quite abstract and indeterminate thing in general, must certainly be as unknowable as it is alleged to be
- EnL",230
15329,"The expression would then serve to signify that these categories are taken in their abstract immediacy, apart from their development and inward character
- EnL",159
15330,"It is no better than a whim of the understanding, therefore, if we attach the qualificatory 'in or by-itself' to the thing only
- EnL",133
15331,"But this 'in or by-itself' is also applied to the facts of the mental as well as the natural world: as we speak of electricity or of a plant in itself, so we speak of man or the state in itself
- EnL",199
15332,"By this 'in-itself' in these objects we are meant to understand what they strictly and properly are
- EnL",105
15333,"This usage is liable to the same criticism as the phrase 'thing-in-itself'
- EnL",80
15334,"For if we stick to the mere 'in-itself' of an object, we apprehend it not in its truth, but in the inadequate form of mere abstraction
- EnL",140
15335,"Thus the man, by or in himself, is the child
- EnL",50
15336,"And what the child has to do is to rise out of this abstract and undeveloped 'in-himself,' and become 'for himself what he is at first only 'in-himself,' a free and reasonable being
- EnL",187
15337,"Similarly, the state-in-itself is the yet immature and patriarchal state, where the various political functions, latent in the notion of the state, have not received the full logical constitution which the logic of political principles demands
- EnL",249
15338,"In the same sense, the germ may be called the plant-in-itself
- EnL",67
15339,"These examples may show the mistake of supposing that the 'thing-in-itself' or the 'in-itself' of things is something inaccessible to our cognition
- EnL",153
15340,"All things are originally in-themselves, but that is not the end of the matter
- EnL",84
15341,"As the germ, being the plant-in-itself, means self-development, so the thing in general passes beyond its in-itself, (the abstract reflection on self,) to manifest itself further as a reflection on other things
- EnL",216
15342,"It is in this sense that it has properties
- EnL",48
15343,"On the side of one of its factors, viz reflection-on-other-things, it has in it the differences, in virtue of which it is a characterised and concrete thing
- EnL",162
15344,"These characteristics are different from one another; they have their reflection-into-self not on their own part, but on the part of the thing
- EnL",148
15345,"They are Properties of the thing: and their relation to the thing is expressed by the word 'have'
- EnL",103
15346,"As a term of relation, 'to have' takes the place of 'to be'
- EnL",65
15347,"True, somewhat has qualities on its part too: but this transference of 'Having' into the sphere of Being is inexact, because the character as quality is directly one with the somewhat, and the somewhat ceases to be when it loses its quality
- EnL",246
15348,"But the thing is reflection-into-self: for it is an identity which is also distinct from the difference, ie from its attributes--In many languages 'have' is employed to denote past time
- EnL",191
15349,"And with reason: for the past is absorbed or suspended being, and the mind is its reflection-into-self; in the mind only it continues to subsist,--the mind however distinguishing from itself this being in it which has been absorbed or suspended
- EnL",250
15350,"Thus the thing, in its initial aspect, as the thing-by-itself, is the self-same or identical
- EnL",98
15351,"But identity, it was proved, is not found without difference: so the properties, which the thing has, are the existent difference in the form of diversity
- EnL",160
15352,"In the case of diversity or variety each diverse member exhibited an indifference to every other, and they had no other relation to each other, save what was given by a comparison external to them
- EnL",202
15353,"But now in the thing we have a bond which keeps the various properties in union
- EnL",85
15354,"Property, besides, should not be confused with quality
- EnL",60
15355,"No doubt, we also say, a thing has qualities
- EnL",50
15356,"But the phraseology is a misplaced one: 'having' hints at an independence, foreign to the 'Somewhat,' which is still directly identical with its quality
- EnL",158
15357,"Somewhat is what it is only by its quality: whereas, though the thing indeed exists only as it has its properties, it is not confined to this or that definite property, and can therefore lose it, without ceasing to be what it is
- EnL",234
15358,"And hence the properties are not merely different from each other; they are also self-identical, independent, and relieved from their attachment to the thing
- EnL",163
15359,"Still, as they are the characters of the thing distinguished from one another (as reflected-into-self), they are not themselves things, if things be concrete; but only existences reflected into themselves as abstract characters
- EnL",233
15360,"They are what are called Matters
- EnL",38
15361,"Nor is the name 'things' given to Matters, such as magnetic and electric matters
- EnL",86
15362,"They are qualities proper, a reflected Being,--one with their Being,--they are the character that has reached immediacy, existence: they are 'entities'
- EnL",157
15363,"To elevate the properties, which the Thing has, to the independent position of matters, or materials of which it consists, is a proceeding based upon the notion of a Thing: and for that reason is also found in experience
- EnL",226
15365,"This disintegration into independent matters is properly restricted to inorganic nature only
- EnL",98
15366,"The chemist is in the right therefore when, for example, he analyses common salt or gypsum into its elements, and finds that the former consists of muriatic acid and soda, the latter of sulphuric acid and calcium
- EnL",218
15367,"So too the geologist does well to regard granite as a compound of quartz, felspar, and mica
- EnL",97
15368,"These matters, again, of which the thing consists, are themselves partly things, which in that way may be once more reduced to more abstract matters
- EnL",154
15369,"Sulphuric acid, for example, is a compound of sulphur and oxygen
- EnL",70
15370,"Such matters or bodies can as a matter of fact be exhibited as subsisting by themselves: but frequently we find other properties of things, entirely wanting this self-subsistence, also regarded as particular matters
- EnL",221
15371,"Thus we hear caloric, and electrical or magnetic matters spoken of
- EnL",72
15372,"Such matters are at the best figments of understanding
- EnL",60
15373,"And we see here the usual procedure of the abstract reflection of understanding
- EnL",85
15375,"Nor is this all
- EnL",21
15376,"The theory, which makes things consist of independent matters, is frequently applied in a region where it has neither meaning nor force
- EnL",141
15377,"For within the limits of nature even, wherever there is organic life, this category is obviously inadequate
- EnL",113
15378,"An animal may be said to consist of bones, muscles, nerves, &c: but evidently we are here using the term 'consist' in a very different sense from its use when we spoke of the piece of granite as consisting of the above-mentioned elements
- EnL",243
15379,"The elements of granite are utterly indifferent to their combination: they could subsist as well without it
- EnL",113
15380,"The different parts and members of an organic body on the contrary subsist only in their union: they cease to exist as such, when they are separated from each other
- EnL",170
15381,"Thus Matter is the mere abstract or indeterminate reflection-into-something-else, or reflection-into-self at the same time as determinate; it is consequently Thinghood which then and there is,--the subsistence of the thing
- EnL",228
15382,"By this means the thing has on the part of the matters its reflection-into-self (the reverse of § 125); it subsists not on its own part, but consists of the matters, and is only a superficial association between them, an external combination of them
- EnL",255
15383,"Hence the numerous diverse matters coalesce into the one Matter, or into existence under the reflective characteristic of identity
- EnL",136
15384,"In contrast to this one Matter these distinct properties and their external relation which they have to one another in the thing, constitute the Form,--the reflective category of difference, but a difference which exists and is a totality
- EnL",244
15385,"This one featureless Matter is also the same as the Thing-by-itself was: only the latter is intrinsically quite abstract, while the former essentially implies relation to something else, and in the first place to the Form
- EnL",227
15386,"Thus we get one Matter in general to which the difference is expressly attached externally and as a bare form
- EnL",115
15387,"This theory which holds things all round to have one and the same matter at bottom, and merely to differ externally in respect of form, is much in vogue with the reflective understanding
- EnL",192
15388,"Matter in that case counts for naturally indeterminate, but susceptible of any determination; while at the same time it is perfectly permanent, and continues the same amid all change and alteration
- EnL",203
15389,"And in finite things at least this disregard of matter for any determinate form is certainly exhibited
- EnL",108
15390,"For example, it matters not to a block of marble, whether it receive the form of this or that statue or even the form of a pillar
- EnL",135
15391,"Be it noted however that a block of marble can disregard form only relatively, that is, in reference to the sculptor: it is by no means purely formless
- EnL",157
15392,"And so the mineralogist considers the relatively formless marble as a special formation of rock, differing from other equally special formations, such as sandstone or porphyry
- EnL",181
15393,"Therefore we say it is an abstraction of the understanding which isolates matter into a certain natural formlessness
- EnL",122
15394,"For properly speaking the thought of matter includes the principle of form throughout, and no formless matter therefore appears anywhere even in experience as existing
- EnL",173
15395,"Still the conception of matter as original and pre-existent, and as naturally formless, is a very ancient one; it meets us even among the Greeks, at first in the mythical shape of Chaos, which is supposed to represent the unformed substratum of the existing world
- EnL",269
15396,"Such a conception must of necessity tend to make God not the Creator of the world, but a mere world-moulder or demiurge
- EnL",125
15397,"A deeper insight into nature reveals God as creating the world out of nothing
- EnL",83
15398,"And that teaches two things
- EnL",33
15399,"On the one hand it enunciates that matter, as such, has no independent subsistence, and on the other that the form does not supervene upon matter from without, but as a totality involves the principle of matter in itself
- EnL",226
15400,"This free and infinite form will hereafter come before us as the notion
- EnL",77
15401,"Thus the Thing suffers a disruption into Matter and Form
- EnL",62
15402,"Each of these is the totality of thinghood and subsists for itself
- EnL",72
15403,"But Matter, which is meant to be the positive and indeterminate existence, contains, as an existence, reflection-on-another, every whit as much as it contains self-enclosed being
- EnL",184
15404,"Accordingly as uniting these characteristics, it is itself the totality of Form
- EnL",85
15405,"But Form, being a complete whole of characteristics, ipso facto involves reflection-into-self; in other words, as self-relating Form it has the very function attributed to Matter
- EnL",184
15406,"Both are at bottom the same
- EnL",33
15407,"Invest them with this unity, and you have the relation of Matter and Form, which are also no less distinct
- EnL",112
15408,"The Thing, being this totality, is a contradiction
- EnL",56
15409,"On the side of its negative unity it is Form in which Matter is determined and deposed to the rank of properties (§ 125)
- EnL",126
15410,"At the same time it consists of Matters, which in the reflection-of-the-thing-into-itself are as much independent as they are at the same time negatived
- EnL",158
15411,"Thus the thing is the essential existence, in such a way as to be an existence that suspends or absorbs itself in itself
- EnL",126
15412,"In other words, the thing is an Appearance or Phenomenon
- EnL",62
15413,"The negation of the several matters, which is insisted on in the thing no less than their independent existence, occurs in Physics as porosity
- EnL",148
15415,"Pores are not empirical facts; they are figments of the understanding, which uses them to represent the element of negation in independent matters
- EnL",152
15417,"These pores (meaning thereby not the pores in an organic body, such as the pores of wood or of the skin, but those in the so-called 'matters,' such as colouring matter, caloric, or metals, crystals, &c) cannot be verified by observation
- EnL",242
15419,"The Essence must appear or shine forth
- EnL",44
15420,"Its shining or reflection in it is the suspension and translation of it to immediacy, which, whilst as reflection-on-self it is matter or subsistence, is also form, reflection-on-something-else, a subsistence which sets itself aside
- EnL",238
15421,"To show or shine is the characteristic by which essence is distinguished from being,--by which it is essence; and it is this show which, when it is developed, shows itself, and is Appearance
- EnL",196
15422,"Essence accordingly is not something beyond or behind appearance, but just because it is the essence which exists--the existence is Appearance (Forth-shining)
- EnL",164
15423,"But appearance (forth-shining) is not to be confused with a mere show (shining)
- EnL",85
15424,"Show is the proximate truth of Being or immediacy
- EnL",55
15425,"The immediate, instead of being, as we suppose, something independent, resting on its own self, is a mere show, and as such it is packed or summed up under the simplicity of the immanent essence
- EnL",200
15428,"But in this conception it is no less implied that essence does not linger behind or beyond appearance
- EnL",107
15429,"Rather it is, we may say, the Infinite kindness which lets its own show freely issue into immediacy, and graciously allows it the joy of existence
- EnL",152
15430,"The appearance which is thus created does not stand on its own feet, and has its being not in itself but in something else
- EnL",128
15432,"Appearance is in every way a very important grade of the logical idea
- EnL",75
15433,"It may be said to be the distinction of philosophy from ordinary consciousness that it sees the merely phenomenal character of what the latter supposes to have a self-subsistent being
- EnL",189
15434,"The significance of appearance however must be properly grasped, or mistakes will arise
- EnL",93
15435,"To say that anything is a mere appearance may be misinterpreted to mean that, as compared with what is merely phenomenal, there is greater truth in the immediate, in that which is
- EnL",185
15436,"Now in strict fact, the case is precisely the reverse
- EnL",59
15437,"Appearance is higher than mere Being,--a richer category because it holds in combination the two elements of reflection-into-self and reflection-into-another: whereas Being (or immediacy) still mere relationlessness and apparently rests upon itself alone
- EnL",260
15438,"Still, to say that anything is only an appearance suggests a real flaw, which consists in this, that Appearance is still divided against itself and without intrinsic stability
- EnL",181
15439,"Beyond and above mere appearance comes in the first place Actuality, the third grade of Essence, of which we shall afterwards speak
- EnL",137
15440,"In the history of Modern Philosophy, Kant has the merit of first rehabilitating this distinction between the common and the philosophic modes of thought
- EnL",158
15441,"He stopped half-way however, when he attached to Appearance a subjective meaning only, and put the abstract essence immovable outside it as the thing-in-itself beyond the reach of our cognition
- EnL",199
15442,"For it is the very nature of the world of immediate objects to be appearance only
- EnL",87
15443,"Knowing it to be so, we know at the same time the essence, which, far from staying behind or beyond the appearance, rather manifests its own essentiality by deposing the world to a mere appearance
- EnL",202
15444,"One can hardly quarrel with the plain man who, in his desire for totality, cannot acquiesce in the doctrine of subjective idealism, that we are solely concerned with phenomena
- EnL",181
15445,"The plain man, however, in his desire to save the objectivity of knowledge, may very naturally return to abstract immediacy, and maintain that immediacy to be true and actual
- EnL",180
15447,"In this dialogue the reader complains to the author that he has completely failed to place himself in the idealist's position, and is inconsolable at the thought that things around him are no real things but mere appearances
- EnL",230
15448,"The affliction of the reader can scarcely be blamed when he is expected to consider himself hemmed in by an impervious circle of purely subjective conceptions
- EnL",164
15449,"Apart from this subjective view of Appearance, however, we have all reason to rejoice that the things which environ us are appearances and not steadfast and independent existences; since in that case we should soon perish of hunger, both bodily and mental
- EnL",261
15450,"The Apparent or Phenomenal exists in such a way, that its subsistence is ipso facto thrown into abeyance or suspended and is only one stage in the form itself
- EnL",164
15451,"The form embraces in it the matter or subsistence as one of its characteristics
- EnL",85
15452,"In this way the phenomenal has its ground in this (form) as its essence, its reflection-into-self in contrast with its immediacy, but, in so doing, has it only in another aspect of the form
- EnL",195
15453,"This ground of its is no less phenomenal than itself, and the phenomenon accordingly goes on to an endless mediation of subsistence by means of form, and thus equally by non-subsistence
- EnL",191
15454,"This endless inter-mediation is at the same time a unity of self-relation; and existence is developed into a totality, into a world of phenomena,--of reflected finitude
- EnL",174
15455,"Outside one another as the phenomena in this phenomenal world are, they form a totality, and are wholly contained in their self-relatedness
- EnL",145
15456,"In this way the self-relation of the phenomenon is completely specified, it has the Form in itself: and because it is in this identity, has it as essential subsistence
- EnL",173
15457,"So it comes about that the form is Content: and in its mature phase is the Law of the Phenomenon
- EnL",102
15458,"When the form, on the contrary, is not reflected into self, it is equivalent to the negative of the phenomenon, to the non-independent and changeable: and that sort of form is the indifferent or External Form
- EnL",214
15459,"The essential point to keep in mind about the opposition of Form and Content is that the content is not formless, but has the form in its own self, quite as much as the form is external to it
- EnL",197
15460,"There is thus a doubling of form
- EnL",38
15461,"At one time it is reflected into itself; and then is identical with the content
- EnL",85
15462,"At another time it is not reflected into itself, and then is the external existence, which does not at all affect the content
- EnL",131
15463,"We are here in presence, implicitly, of the absolute correlation of content and form: viz their reciprocal revulsion, so that content is nothing but the revulsion of form into content, and form nothing but the revulsion of content into form
- EnL",246
15464,"This mutual revulsion is one of the most important laws of thought
- EnL",72
15465,"But it is not explicitly brought out before the Relations of Substance and Causality
- EnL",90
15466,"Form and content are a pair of terms frequently employed by the reflective understanding, especially with a habit of looking on the content as the essential and independent, the form on the contrary as the unessential and dependent
- EnL",237
15468,"Still the form comes before us sometimes as an existence indifferent and external to content, and does so for the reason that the whole range of Appearance still suffers from externality
- EnL",192
15469,"In a book, for instance, it certainly has no bearing upon the content, whether it be written or printed, bound in paper or in leather
- EnL",139
15470,"That however does not in the least imply that apart from such an indifferent and external form, the content of the book is itself formless
- EnL",144
15471,"There are undoubtedly books enough which even in reference to their content may well be styled formless: but want of form in this case is the same as bad form, and means the defect of the right form, not the absence of all form whatever
- EnL",242
15472,"So far is this right form from being unaffected by the content that it is rather the content itself
- EnL",105
15473,"A work of art that wants the right form is for that very reason no right or true work of art: and it is a bad way of excusing an artist, to say that the content of his works is good and even excellent, though they want the right form
- EnL",239
15474,"Real works of art are those where content and form exhibit a thorough identity
- EnL",84
15475,"The content of the Iliad, it may be said, is the Trojan war, and especially the wrath of Achilles
- EnL",103
15476,"In that we have everything, and yet very little after all; for the Iliad is made an Iliad by the poetic form, in which that content is moulded
- EnL",148
15477,"The content of Romeo and Juliet may similarly be said to be the ruin of two lovers through the discord between their families: but something more is needed to make Shakespeare's immortal tragedy
- EnL",200
15478,"In reference to the relation of form and content in the field of science, we should recollect the difference between philosophy and the rest of the sciences
- EnL",162
15479,"The latter are finite, because their mode of thought, as a merely formal act, derives its content from without
- EnL",116
15480,"Their content therefore is not known as moulded from within through the thoughts which lie at the ground of it, and form and content do not thoroughly interpenetrate each other
- EnL",182
15481,"This partition disappears in philosophy, and thus justifies its title of infinite knowledge
- EnL",97
15482,"Yet even philosophic thought is often held to be a merely formal act; and that logic, which confessedly deals only with thoughts quâ thoughts, is merely formal, is especially a foregone conclusion
- EnL",202
15483,"And if content means no more than what is palpable and obvious to the senses, all philosophy and logic in particular must be at once acknowledged to be void of content, that is to say, of content perceptible to the senses
- EnL",227
15484,"Even ordinary forms of thought however, and the common usage of language, do not in the least restrict the appellation of content to what is perceived by the senses, or to what has a being in place and time
- EnL",212
15485,"A book without content is, as every one knows, not a book with empty leaves, but one of which the content is as good as none
- EnL",130
15486,"We shall find as the last result on closer analysis, that by what is called content an educated mind means nothing but the presence and power of thought
- EnL",158
15487,"But this is to admit that thoughts are not empty forms without affinity to their content, and that in other spheres as well as in art the truth and the sterling value of the content essentially depend on the content showing itself identical with the form
- EnL",260
15488,"But immediate existence is a character of the subsistence itself as well as of the form: it is consequently external to the character of the content; but in an equal degree this externality, which the content has through the factor of its subsistence, is essential to it
- EnL",276
15490,"The content is the whole, and consists of the parts (the form), its counterpart
- EnL",85
15491,"The parts are diverse one from another
- EnL",44
15492,"It is they that possess independent being
- EnL",47
15493,"But they are parts, only when they are identified by being related to one another; or, in so far as they make up the whole, when taken together
- EnL",149
15494,"But this 'Together' is the counterpart and negation of the part
- EnL",69
15495,"Essential correlation is the specific and completely universal phase in which things appear
- EnL",97
15496,"Everything that exists stands in correlation, and this correlation is the veritable nature of every existence
- EnL",115
15497,"The existent thing in this way has no being of its own, but only in something else: in this other however it is self-relation; and correlation is the unity of the self-relation and relation-to-others
- EnL",205
15498,"The relation of the whole and the parts is untrue to this extent, that the notion and the reality of the relation are not in harmony
- EnL",138
15499,"The notion of the whole is to contain parts: but if the whole is taken and made what its notion implies, ie if it is divided, it at once ceases to be a whole
- EnL",163
15500,"Things there are, no doubt, which correspond to this relation: but for that very reason they are low and untrue existences
- EnL",128
15501,"We must remember however what 'untrue' signifies
- EnL",54
15502,"When it occurs in a philosophical discussion, the term 'untrue' does not signify that the thing to which it is applied is non-existent
- EnL",140
15503,"A bad state or a sickly body may exist all the same; but these things are untrue, because their notion and their reality are out of harmony
- EnL",145
15504,"The relation of whole and parts, being the immediate relation, comes easy to reflective understanding; and for that reason it often satisfies when the question really turns on profounder ties
- EnL",197
15505,"The limbs and organs, for instance, of an organic body are not merely parts of it: it is only in their unity that they are what they are, and they are unquestionably affected by that unity, as they also in turn affect it
- EnL",226
15506,"These limbs and organs become mere parts, only when they pass under the hands of the anatomist, whose occupation, be it remembered, is not with the living body but with the corpse
- EnL",185
15507,"Not that such analysis is illegitimate: we only mean that the external and mechanical relation of whole and parts is not sufficient for us, if we want to study organic life in its truth
- EnL",191
15508,"And if this be so in organic life, it is the case to a much greater extent when we apply this relation to the mind and the formations of the spiritual world
- EnL",162
15509,"Psychologists may not expressly speak of parts of the soul or mind, but the mode in which this subject is treated by the analytic understanding is largely founded on the analogy of this finite relation
- EnL",207
15510,"At least that is so, when the different forms of mental activity are enumerated and described merely in their isolation one after another, as so-called special powers and faculties
- EnL",186
15512,"This gives the correlation of Force and its Expression
- EnL",60
15513,"The relationship of whole and part is the immediate and therefore unintelligent (mechanical) relation,--a revulsion of self-identity into mere variety
- EnL",156
15514,"Thus we pass from the whole to the parts, and from the parts to the whole: in the one we forget its opposition to the other, while each on its own account, at one time the whole, at another the parts, is taken to be an independent existence
- EnL",246
15515,"In other words, when the parts are declared to subsist in the whole, and the whole to consist of the parts, we have either member of the relation at different times taken to be permanently subsistent, while the other is non-essential
- EnL",239
15516,"In its superficial form the mechanical nexus consists in the parts being independent of each other and of the whole
- EnL",121
15517,"This relation may be adopted for the progression ad infinitum, in the case of the divisibility of matter: and then it becomes an unintelligent alternation with the two sides
- EnL",179
15518,"A thing at one time is taken as a whole: then we go on to specify the parts: this specifying is forgotten, and what was a part is regarded as a whole: then the specifying of the part comes up again, and so on for ever
- EnL",223
15521,"For one another they are therefore different, and the relationship is a finite one
- EnL",88
15522,"Force consequently requires solicitation from without: it works blindly: and on account of this defectiveness of form, the content is also limited and accidental
- EnL",167
15523,"It is not yet genuinely identical with the form: not yet is it as a notion and an end; that is to say, it is not intrinsically and actually determinate
- EnL",157
15524,"This difference is most vital, but not easy to apprehend: it will assume a clearer formulation when we reach Design
- EnL",121
15525,"If it be overlooked, it leads to the confusion of conceiving God as Force, a confusion from which Herder's God especially suffers
- EnL",135
15526,"It is often said that the nature of Force itself is unknown and only its manifestation apprehended
- EnL",104
15527,"But, in the first place, it may be replied, every article in the import of Force is the same as what is specified in the Exertion: and the explanation of a phenomenon by a Force is to that extent a mere tautology
- EnL",218
15528,"It is a form that does not make the slightest addition to the content and to the law, which have to be discovered from the phenomenon alone
- EnL",145
15529,"Another assurance always given is that to speak of forces implies no theory as to their nature: and that being so, it is impossible to see why the form of Force has been introduced into the sciences at all
- EnL",211
15531,"In it that identity of the two sides is realised, which in the former relation only existed for the observer
- EnL",114
15532,"The whole, though we can see that it consists of parts, ceases to be a whole when it is divided: whereas force is only shown to be force when it exerts itself, and in its exercise only comes back to itself
- EnL",211
15533,"The exercise is only force once more
- EnL",42
15534,"Yet, on further examination even this relation will appear finite, and finite in virtue of this mediation: just as, conversely, the relation of whole and parts is obviously finite in virtue of its immediacy
- EnL",212
15535,"The first and simplest evidence for the finitude of the mediated relation of force and its exercise is, that each and every force is conditioned and requires something else than itself for its subsistence
- EnL",210
15536,"For instance, a special vehicle of magnetic force, as is well known, is iron, the other properties of which, such as its colour, specific weight, or relation to acids, are independent of this connexion with magnetism
- EnL",222
15537,"The same thing is seen in all other forces, which from one end to the other are found to be conditioned and mediated by something else than themselves
- EnL",156
15538,"Another proof of the finite nature of force is that it requires solicitation before it can put itself forth
- EnL",113
15539,"That through which the force is solicited, is itself another exertion of force, which cannot put itself forth without similar solicitation
- EnL",144
15540,"This brings us either to a repetition of the infinite progression, or to a reciprocity of soliciting and being solicited
- EnL",126
15541,"In either case we have no absolute beginning of motion
- EnL",60
15542,"Force is not as yet, like the final cause, inherently self-determining: the content is given to it as determined, and force, when it exerts itself, is, according to the phrase, blind in its working
- EnL",203
15543,"That phrase implies the distinction between abstract force-manifestation and teleological action
- EnL",102
15544,"It is the very essence of force to manifest itself, and thus in the totality of manifestation, conceived as a law, we at the same time discover the force itself
- EnL",166
15545,"And yet this assertion that force in its own self is unknowable betrays a well-grounded presentiment that this relation is finite
- EnL",135
15547,"But the different forces themselves are a multiplicity again, and in their mere juxtaposition seem to be contingent
- EnL",121
15548,"Hence in empirical physics, we speak of the forces of gravity, magnetism, electricity, &c, and in empirical psychology of the forces of memory, imagination, will, and all the other faculties
- EnL",196
15549,"All this multiplicity again excites a craving to know these different forces as a single whole, nor would this craving be appeased even if the several forces were traced back to one common primary force
- EnL",208
15550,"Such a primary force would be really no more than an empty abstraction, with as little content as the abstract thing-in-itself
- EnL",132
15551,"And besides this, the correlation of force and manifestation is essentially a mediated correlation (of reciprocal dependence), and it must therefore contradict the notion of force to view it as primary or resting on itself
- EnL",228
15552,"Such being the case with the nature of force, though we may consent to let the world be called a manifestation of divine forces, we should object to have God Himself viewed as a mere force
- EnL",194
15553,"For force is after all a subordinate and finite category
- EnL",62
15554,"At the so-called renascence of the sciences, when steps were taken to trace the single phenomena of nature back to underlying forces, the Church branded the enterprise as impious
- EnL",184
15555,"The argument of the Church was as follows
- EnL",47
15556,"If it be the forces of gravitation, of vegetation, &c which occasion the movements of the heavenly bodies, the growth of plants, &c, there is nothing left for divine providence, and God sinks to the level of a leisurely on-looker, surveying this play of forces
- EnL",266
15557,"The students of nature, it is true, and Newton more than others, when they employed the reflective category of force to explain natural phenomena, have expressly pleaded that the honour of God, as the Creator and Governor of the world, would not thereby be impaired
- EnL",271
15558,"Still the logical issue of this explanation by means of forces is that the inferential understanding proceeds to fix each of these forces, and to maintain them in their finitude as ultimate
- EnL",195
15559,"And contrasted with this deinfinitised world of independent forces and matters, the only terms in which it is possible still to describe God will present Him in the abstract infinity of an unknowable supreme Being in some other world far away
- EnL",248
15560,"This is precisely the position of materialism, and of modern 'free-thinking,' whose theology ignores what God is and restricts itself to the mere fact that He is
- EnL",167
15561,"In this dispute therefore the Church and the religious mind have to a certain extent the right on their side
- EnL",114
15562,"The finite forms of understanding certainly fail to fulfil the conditions for a knowledge either of Nature or of the formations in the world of Mind as they truly are
- EnL",172
15564,"When our religious consciousness, resting upon the authority of the Church, teaches us that God created the world by His almighty will, that He guides the stars in their courses, and vouchsafes to all His creatures their existence and their well-being, the question Why?
- EnL",276
15565,"Now it is the answer to this question which forms the common task of empirical science and of philosophy
- EnL",110
15566,"Such an appeal is no better than an arbitrary dogmatism, which contravenes the express command of Christianity, to know God in spirit and in truth, and is prompted by a humility which is not Christian, but born of ostentatious bigotry
- EnL",240
15567,"Force is a whole, which is in its own self negative self-relation; and as such a whole it continually pushes itself off from itself and puts itself forth
- EnL",159
15568,"The very act of out-putting accordingly sets in abeyance the diversity of the two sides which is found in this correlation, and expressly states the identity which virtually constitutes their content
- EnL",205
15569,"The truth of Force and utterance therefore is that relation, in which the two sides are distinguished only as Outward and Inward
- EnL",134
15570,"As a counterpart to it stands the Outward (Exterior),--Existence, also as the form of the other side of the correlation, with the empty characteristic of reflection-into-something-else
- EnL",190
15571,"But Inward and Outward are identified: and their identity is identity brought to fulness in the content, that unity of reflection-into-self and reflection-into-other which was forced to appear in the movement of force
- EnL",223
15572,"Both are the same one totality, and this unity makes them the content
- EnL",75
15573,"In the first place then, Exterior is the same content as Interior
- EnL",71
15574,"What is inwardly is also found outwardly, and vice versâ
- EnL",62
15575,"The appearance shows nothing that is not in the essence, and in the essence there is nothing but what is manifested
- EnL",121
15576,"In the second place, Inward and Outward, as formal terms, are also reciprocally opposed, and that thoroughly
- EnL",114
15577,"The one is the abstraction of identity with self; the other, of mere multiplicity or reality
- EnL",98
15578,"But as stages of the one form, they are essentially identical: so that whatever is at first explicitly put only in the one abstraction, is also as plainly and at one step only in the other
- EnL",194
15579,"Therefore what is only internal is also only external: and what is only external, is so far only at first internal
- EnL",120
15580,"It is the customary mistake of reflection to take the essence to be merely the interior
- EnL",93
15581,"If it be so taken, even this way of looking at it is purely external, and that sort of essence is the empty external abstraction
- EnL",134
15585,"The relation of Outward and Inward unites the two relations that precede, and at the same time sets in abeyance mere relativity and phenomenality in general
- EnL",162
15586,"Yet so long as understanding keeps the Inward and Outward fixed in their separation, they are empty forms, the one as null as the other
- EnL",141
15588,"As for nature, it certainly is in the gross external, not merely to the mind, but even on its own part
- EnL",108
15589,"But to call it external 'in the gross' is not to imply an abstract externality--for there is no such thing
- EnL",112
15590,"It means rather that the Idea which forms the common content of nature and mind, is found in nature as outward only, and for that very reason only inward
- EnL",159
15591,"The abstract understanding, with its 'Either--or,' may struggle against this conception of nature
- EnL",103
15592,"It is none the less obviously found in our other modes of consciousness, particularly in religion
- EnL",103
15594,"Those who look upon the essence of nature as mere inwardness, and therefore inaccessible to us, take up the same line as that ancient creed which regarded God as envious and jealous; a creed which both Plato and Aristotle pronounced against long ago

15595,"All that God is, He imparts and reveals; and He does so, at first, in and through nature

15603,"There certainly may be individual cases, where the malice of outward circumstances frustrates well-meant designs, and disturbs the execution of the best-laid plans

15604,"But in general even here the essential unity between inward and outward is maintained

- EnL",190
15619,"The psychology in question however is only that petty knowledge of men, which looks away from the essential and permanent in human nature to fasten its glance on the casual and private features shown in isolated instincts and passions
- EnL",240
15621,"The latter however are the motives which must be viewed by the pragmatist as really efficient, otherwise the assumption of a contrast between the inward (the disposition of the agent) and the outward (the import of the action) would fall to the ground

- EnL",99
15687,"After all there is as good reason for taking everything to be impossible, as to be possible: for every content (a content is always concrete) includes not only diverse but even opposite characteristics
- EnL",207
15688,"Nothing is so impossible, for instance, as this, that I am: for 'I' is at the same time simple self-relation and, as undoubtedly, relation to something else
- EnL",162
15689,"The same may be seen in every other fact in the natural or spiritual world
- EnL",80
15690,"Matter, it may be said, is impossible: for it is the unity of attraction and repulsion
- EnL",92
15691,"The same is true of life, law, freedom, and above all, of God Himself, as the true, eg the triune God,--a notion of God, which the abstract 'Enlightenment' of Understanding, in conformity with its canons, rejected on the allegation that it was contradictory in thought
- EnL",274
15692,"Generally speaking, it is the empty understanding which haunts these empty forms: and the business of philosophy in the matter is to show how null and meaningless they are
- EnL",177
15693,"Whether a thing is possible or impossible, depends altogether on the subject-matter: that is, on the sum total of the elements in actuality, which, as it opens itself out, discloses itself to be necessity
- EnL",210
15694,"In other words, to such extent as the actual is primarily (§ 142) the simple merely immediate unity of Inward and Outward, it is obviously made an unessential outward, and thus at the same time (§ 140) it is merely inward, the abstraction of reflection-into-self
- EnL",268
15695,"Hence it is itself characterised as a merely possible
- EnL",59
15696,"When thus valued at the rate of a mere possibility, the actual is a Contingent or Accidental, and, conversely, possibility is mere Accident itself or Chance
- EnL",162
15697,"Possibility and Contingency are the two factors of Actuality,--Inward and Outward, put as mere forms which constitute the externality of the actual
- EnL",153
15698,"They have their reflection-into-self on the body of actual fact, or content, with its intrinsic definiteness which gives the essential ground of their characterisation
- EnL",173
15699,"The finitude of the contingent and the possible lies, therefore, as we now see, in the distinction of the form-determination from the content: and, therefore, it depends on the content alone whether anything is contingent and possible
- EnL",240
15700,"As possibility is the mere inside of actuality, it is for that reason a mere outside actuality, in other words, Contingency
- EnL",129
15701,"The contingent, roughly speaking, is what has the ground of its being not in itself but in somewhat else
- EnL",110
15702,"Such is the aspect under which actuality first comes before consciousness, and which is often mistaken for actuality itself
- EnL",129
15703,"But the contingent is only one side of the actual,--the side, namely, of reflection on somewhat else
- EnL",106
15704,"It is the actual, in the signification of something merely possible
- EnL",73
15705,"Accordingly we consider the contingent to be what may or may not be, what may be in one way or in another, whose being or not-being, and whose being on this wise or otherwise, depends not upon itself but on something else
- EnL",227
15706,"To overcome this contingency is, roughly speaking, the problem of science on the one hand; as in the range of practice, on the other, the end of action is to rise above the contingency of the will, or above caprice
- EnL",220
15707,"It has however often happened, most of all in modern times, that contingency has been unwarrantably elevated, and had a value attached to it, both in nature and the world of mind, to which it has no just claim
- EnL",215
15708,"Frequently Nature--to take it first,--has been chiefly admired for the richness and variety of its structures
- EnL",115
15709,"Apart, however, from what disclosure it contains of the Idea, this richness gratifies none of the higher interests of reason, and in its vast variety of structures, organic and inorganic, affords us only the spectacle of a contingency losing itself in vagueness
- EnL",267
15711,"The wonderment with which such phenomena are welcomed is a most abstract frame of mind, from which one should advance to a closer insight into the inner harmony and uniformity of nature
- EnL",191
15712,"Of contingency in respect of the Will it is especially important to form a proper estimate
- EnL",96
15713,"The Freedom of the Will is an expression that often means mere free-choice, or the will in the form of contingency
- EnL",120
15714,"Freedom of choice, or the capacity of determining ourselves towards one thing or another, is undoubtedly a vital element in the will (which in its very notion is free); but instead of being freedom itself, it is only in the first instance a freedom in form
- EnL",262
15715,"The genuinely free will, which includes free choice as suspended, is conscious to itself that its content is intrinsically firm and fast, and knows it at the same time to be thoroughly its own
- EnL",198
15716,"A will, on the contrary, which remains standing on the grade of option, even supposing it does decide in favour of what is in import right and true, is always haunted by the conceit that it might, if it had so pleased, have decided in favour of the reverse course
- EnL",269
15717,"When more narrowly examined, free choice is seen to be a contradiction, to this extent that its form and content stand in antithesis
- EnL",138
15718,"The matter of choice is given, and known as a content dependent not on the will itself,'but on outward circumstances
- EnL",122
15719,"In reference to such a given content, freedom lies only in the form of choosing, which, as it is only a freedom in form, may consequently be regarded as freedom only in supposition
- EnL",186
15720,"On an ultimate analysis it will be seen that the same outwardness of circumstances, on which is founded the content that the will finds to its hand, can alone account for the will giving its decision for the one and not the other of the two alternatives
- EnL",259
15721,"Although contingency, as it has thus been shown, is only one aspect in the whole of actuality, and therefore not to be mistaken for actuality itself, it has no less than the rest of the forms of the idea its due office in the world of objects
- EnL",248
15722,"This is, in the first place, seen in Nature
- EnL",49
15723,"On the surface of Nature, so to speak, Chance ranges unchecked, and that contingency must simply be recognised, without the pretension sometimes erroneously ascribed to philosophy, of seeking to find in it a could-only-be-so-and-not-otherwise
- EnL",248
15724,"Nor is contingency less visible in the world of Mind
- EnL",58
15725,"The will, as we have already remarked, includes contingency under the shape of option or free-choice, but only as a vanishing and abrogated element
- EnL",153
15728,"That however is far from meaning that the contingent belongs to our subjective conception alone, and must therefore be simply set aside, if we wish to get at the truth
- EnL",173
15729,"All scientific researches which pursue this tendency exclusively, lay themselves fairly open to the charge of mere jugglery and an over-strained precisianism
- EnL",163
15730,"When more closely examined, what the aforesaid outward side of actuality implies is this
- EnL",94
15731,"Contingency, which is actuality in its immediacy, is the self-identical, essentially only as a supposition which is no sooner made than it is revoked and leaves an existent externality
- EnL",190
15732,"In this way, the external contingency is something pre-supposed, the immediate existence of which is at the same time a possibility, and has the vocation to be suspended, to be the possibility of something else
- EnL",216
15733,"Now this possibility is the Condition
- EnL",43
15734,"The Contingent, as the immediate actuality, is at the same time the possibility of somewhat else,--no longer however that abstract possibility which we had at first, but the possibility which is
- EnL",200
15735,"And a possibility existent is a Condition
- EnL",47
15737,"But the other aspect of actuality is its essentiality
- EnL",59
15738,"This is primarily the inside, which as a mere possibility is no less destined to be suspended
- EnL",99
15739,"Possibility thus suspended is the issuing of a new actuality, of which the first immediate actuality was the pre-supposition
- EnL",130
15740,"Here we see the alternation which is involved in the notion of a Condition
- EnL",80
15741,"The Conditions of a thing seem at first sight to involve no bias anyway
- EnL",77
15742,"Really however an immediate actuality of this kind includes in it the germ of something else altogether
- EnL",109
15743,"At first this something else is only a possibility: but the form of possibility is soon suspended and translated into actuality
- EnL",133
15744,"This new actuality thus issuing is the very inside of the immediate actuality which it uses up
- EnL",100
15745,"Thus there comes into being quite an other shape of things, and yet itis not an other: for the first actuality is only put as what it in essence was
- EnL",154
15746,"The conditions which are sacrificed, which fall to the ground and are spent, only unite with themselves in the other actuality
- EnL",132
15747,"Such in general is the nature of the process of actuality
- EnL",63
15748,"The actual is no mere case of immediate Being, but, as essential Being, a suspension of its own immediacy, and thereby mediating itself with itself
- EnL",153
15749,"Being such a circle, further, it is the totality, and thus the content, the actual fact or affair in its all-round definiteness
- EnL",133
15751,"If all the conditions are at hand, the fact (event) must be actual; and the fact itself is one of the conditions: for being in the first place only inner, it is at first itself only pre-supposed
- EnL",200
15752,"Developed actuality, as the coincident alternation of inner and outer, the alternation of their opposite motions combined into a single motion, is Necessity
- EnL",162
15753,"Necessity has been defined, and rightly so, as the union of possibility and actuality
- EnL",91
15754,"This mode of expression, however, gives a superficial and therefore unintelligible description of the very difficult notion of necessity
- EnL",142
15755,"It is difficult because it is the notion itself, only that its stages or factors are still as actualities, which are yet at the same time to be viewed as forms only, collapsing and transient
- EnL",196
15756,"In the two following paragraphs therefore an exposition of the factors which constitute necessity must be given at greater length
- EnL",135
15757,"Anything necessary accordingly comes before us as something due to a supposition, the result of certain antecedents
- EnL",121
15758,"If we go no further than mere derivation from antecedents however, we have not gained a complete notion of what necessity means
- EnL",133
15759,"What is merely derivative, is what it is, not through itself, but through something else; and in this way it too is merely contingent
- EnL",139
15760,"What is necessary, on the other hand, we would have be what it is through itself; and thus, although derivative, it must still contain the antecedent whence it is derived as a vanishing element in itself
- EnL",209
15761,"Hence we say of what is necessary, 'It is'
- EnL",48
15762,"We thus hold it to be simple self-relation, in which all dependence on something else is removed
- EnL",102
15763,"Necessity is often said to be blind
- EnL",41
15764,"If that means that in the process of necessity the End or final cause is not explicitly and overtly present, the statement is correct
- EnL",139
15765,"The process of necessity begins with the existence of scattered circumstances which appear to have no inter-connexion and no concern one with another
- EnL",155
15766,"These circumstances are an immediate actuality which collapses, and out of this negation a new actuality proceeds
- EnL",119
15767,"Here we have a content which in point of form is doubled, once as content of the final realised fact, and once as content of the scattered circumstances which appear as if they were positive, and make themselves at first felt in that character
- EnL",249
15768,"The latter content is in itself nought and is accordingly inverted into its negative, thus becoming content of the realised fact
- EnL",134
15769,"The immediate circumstances fall to the ground as conditions, but are at the same time retained as content of the ultimate reality
- EnL",136
15770,"From such circumstances and conditions there has, as we say, proceeded quite another thing, and it is for that reason that we call this process of necessity blind
- EnL",168
15771,"If on the contrary we consider teleological action, we have in the end of action a content which is already fore-known
- EnL",124
15772,"This activity therefore is not blind but seeing
- EnL",53
15773,"To say that the world is ruled by Providence implies that design, as what has been absolutely pre-determined, is the active principle, so that the issue corresponds to what has been fore-known and fore-willed
- EnL",214
15774,"The theory however which regards the world as determined through necessity and the belief in a divine providence are by no means mutually excluding points of view
- EnL",168
15775,"The intellectual principle underlying the idea of divine providence will hereafter be shown to be the notion
- EnL",114
15776,"But the notion is the truth of necessity, which it contains in suspension in itself; just as, conversely, necessity is the notion implicit
- EnL",144
15777,"Necessity is blind only so long as it is not understood
- EnL",61
15778,"There is nothing therefore more mistaken than the charge of blind fatalism made against the Philosophy of History, when it takes for its problem to understand the necessity of every event
- EnL",193
15779,"The philosophy of history rightly understood takes the rank of a Théodicée; and those, who fancy they honour Divine Providence by excluding necessity from it, are really degrading it by this exclusiveness to a blind and irrational caprice
- EnL",244
15780,"In the simple language of the religious mind which speaks of God's eternal and immutable decrees, there is implied an express recognition that necessity forms part of the essence of God
- EnL",191
15781,"In his difference from God, man, with his own private opinion and will, follows the call of caprice and arbitrary humour, and thus often finds his acts turn out something quite different from what he had meant and willed
- EnL",226
15782,"But God knows what He wills, is determined in His eternal will neither by accident from within nor from without, and what He wills He also accomplishes, irresistibly
- EnL",171
15783,"Necessity gives a point of view which has important bearings upon our sentiments and behaviour
- EnL",100
15784,"In the creed of the ancients, as we know, necessity figured as Destiny
- EnL",76
15785,"The modern point of view, on the contrary, is that of Consolation
- EnL",71
15786,"And Consolation means that, if we renounce our aims and interests, we do so only in prospect of receiving compensation
- EnL",124
15787,"Destiny, on the contrary, leaves no room for Consolation
- EnL",62
15788,"But a close examination of the ancient feeling about destiny, will not by any means reveal a sense of bondage to its power
- EnL",128
15789,"Rather the reverse
- EnL",24
15790,"This will clearly appear, if we remember, that the sense of bondage springs from inability to surmount the antithesis, and from looking at what is, and what happens, as contradictory to what ought to be and happen
- EnL",219
15791,"In the ancient mind the feeling was more of the following kind: Because such a thing is, it is, and as it is, so ought it to be
- EnL",133
15792,"Here there is no contrast to be seen, and therefore no sense of bondage, no pain, and no sorrow
- EnL",101
15793,"True, indeed, as already remarked, this attitude towards destiny is void of consolation
- EnL",93
15794,"But then, on the other hand, it is a frame of mind which does not need consolation, so long as personal subjectivity has not acquired its infinite significance
- EnL",165
15795,"It is this point on which special stress should be laid in comparing the ancient sentiment with that of the modern and Christian world
- EnL",140
15798,"But the term subjectivity is not to be confined merely to the bad and finite kind of it which is contrasted with the thing (fact)
- EnL",135
15799,"In its truth subjectivity is immanent in the fact, and as a subjectivity thus infinite is the very truth of the fact
- EnL",122
15800,"Thus regarded, the doctrine of consolation receives a newer and a higher significance
- EnL",91
15801,"It is in this sense that the Christian religion is to be regarded as the religion of consolation, and even of absolute consolation
- EnL",136
15802,"Christianity, we know, teaches that God wishes all men to be saved
- EnL",72
15803,"That teaching declares that subjectivity has an infinite value
- EnL",68
15805,"The gods of the ancient world were also, it is true, looked upon as personal; but the personality of a Zeus and an Apollo is not a real personality: it is only a figure in the mind
- EnL",186
15806,"In other words, these gods are mere personifications, which, being such, do not know themselves, and are only known
- EnL",121
15807,"An evidence of this defect and this powerlessness of the old gods is found even in the religious beliefs of antiquity
- EnL",123
15808,"In the ancient creeds not only men, but even gods, were represented as subject to destiny (πεπρωμένον or εἱμαρμένη), a destiny which we must conceive as necessity not unveiled, and thus as something wholly impersonal, selfless, and blind
- EnL",243
15809,"On the other hand, the Christian God is God not known merely, but also self-knowing; He is a personality not merely figured in our minds, but rather absolutely actual
- EnL",172
15810,"We must refer to the Philosophy of Religion for a further discussion of the points here touched
- EnL",101
15811,"But we may note in passing how important it is for any man to meet everything that befalls him with the spirit of the old proverb which describes each man as the architect of his own fortune
- EnL",196
15812,"That means that it is only himself after all of which a man has the usufruct
- EnL",82
15813,"The other way would be to lay the blame of whatever we experience upon other men, upon unfavourable circumstances, and the like
- EnL",133
15814,"And this is a fresh example of the language of unfreedom, and at the same time the spring of discontent
- EnL",109
15815,"If man saw, on the contrary, that whatever happens to him is only the outcome of himself, and that he only bears his own guilt, he would stand free, and in everything that came upon him would have the consciousness that he suffered no wrong
- EnL",246
15816,"A man who lives in dispeace with himself and his lot, commits much that is perverse and amiss, for no other reason than because of the false opinion that he is wronged by others
- EnL",183
15817,"No doubt too there is a great deal of chance in what befalls us
- EnL",69
15818,"But the chance has its root in the 'natural' man
- EnL",54
15819,"So long however as a man is otherwise conscious that he is free, his harmony of soul and peace of mind will not be destroyed by the disagreeables that befall him
- EnL",167
15820,"It is their view of necessity, therefore, which is at the root of the content and discontent of men, and which in that way determines their destiny itself
- EnL",160
15821,"Among the three elements in the process of necessity--the Condition, the Fact, and the Activity--  a
- EnL",106
15822,"The Condition is (α) what is pre-supposed or ante-stated, eg it is not only supposed or stated, and so only a correlative to the fact, but also prior, and so independent, a contingent and external circumstance which exists without respect to the fact
- EnL",256
15823,"While thus contingent, however, this pre-supposed or ante-stated term, in respect withal of the fact, which is the totality, is a complete circle of conditions, (ß) The conditions are passive, are used as materials for the fact, into the content of which they thus enter
- EnL",276
15824,"They are likewise intrinsically conformable to this content, and already contain its whole characteristic
- EnL",111
15826,"In so far as these three elements stand to each other in the shape of independent existences, this process has the aspect of an outward necessity
- EnL",151
15827,"Outward necessity has a limited content for its fact
- EnL",58
15828,"For the fact is this whole, in phase of singleness
- EnL",56
15829,"But since in its form this whole is external to itself, it is self-externalised even in its own self and in its content, and this externality, attaching to the fact, is a limit of its content
- EnL",197
15830,"Necessity, then, is potentially the one essence, self-same but now full of content, in the reflected light of which its distinctions take the form of independent realities
- EnL",177
15831,"The necessary, being through an other, is not in and for itself: hypothetical, it is a mere result of assumption
- EnL",118
15832,"But this intermediation is just as immediately however the abrogation of itself
- EnL",85
15833,"The ground and contingent condition is translated into immediacy, by which that dependency is now lifted up into actuality, and the fact has closed with itself
- EnL",165
15834,"In this return to itself the necessary simply and positively is, as unconditioned actuality
- EnL",97
15835,"The necessary is so, mediated through a circle of circumstances: it is so, because the circumstances are so, and at the same time it is so, unmediated: it is so, because it is
- EnL",181
15836,"The necessary is in itself an absolute correlation of elements, ie the process developed (in the preceding paragraphs), in which the correlation also suspends itself to absolute identity
- EnL",192
15837,"In its immediate form it is the relationship of Substance and Accident
- EnL",76
15838,"The absolute self-identity of this relationship is Substance as such, which as necessity gives the negative to this form of inwardness, and thus invests itself with actuality, but which also gives the negative to this outward thing
- EnL",237
15839,"In this negativity, the actual, as immediate, is only an accidental which through this bare possibility passes over into another actuality
- EnL",144
15840,"This transition is the identity of substance, regarded as form-activity (§§ 148, 149)
- EnL",91
15841,"Substance is accordingly the totality of the Accidents, revealing itself in them as their absolute negativity, (that is to say, as absolute power,) and at the same time as the wealth of all content
- EnL",203
15842,"This content however is nothing but that very revelation, since the character (being reflected in itself to make content) is only a passing stage of the form which passes away in the power of substance
- EnL",207
15843,"Substantiality is the absolute form-activity and the power of necessity: all content is but a vanishing element which merely belongs to this process, where there is an absolute revulsion of form and content into one another
- EnL",229
15844,"On the import and value of that much-praised and no less decried philosophy there has been great misunderstanding and a deal of talking since the days of Spinoza
- EnL",167
15845,"The atheism and, as a further charge, the pantheism of the system has formed the commonest ground of accusation
- EnL",117
15846,"These cries arise because of Spinoza's conception of God as substance, and substance only
- EnL",95
15847,"Though an essential stage in the evolution of the idea, substance is not the same with absolute Idea, but the idea under the still limited form of necessity
- EnL",162
15848,"It is true that God is necessity, or, as we may also put it, that He is the absolute Thing: He is however no less the absolute Person
- EnL",139
15849,"That He is the absolute Person however is a point which the philosophy of Spinoza never reached: and on that side it falls short of the true notion of God which forms the content of religious consciousness in Christianity
- EnL",227
15850,"Spinoza was by descent a Jew; and it is upon the whole the Oriental way of seeing things, according to which the nature of the finite world seems frail and transient, that has found its intellectual expression in his system
- EnL",229
15851,"This Oriental view of the unity of substance certainly gives the basis for all real further development
- EnL",109
15852,"Still it is not the final idea
- EnL",36
15853,"From this point we glance back to the alleged atheism of Spinoza
- EnL",70
15854,"The charge will be seen to be unfounded if we remember that his system, instead of denying God, rather recognises that He alone really is
- EnL",143
15855,"Nor can it be maintained that the God of Spinoza, although he is described as alone true, is not the true God, and therefore as good as no God
- EnL",148
15857,"The so-called atheism of Spinoza is merely an exaggeration of the fact that he defrauds the principle of difference or finitude of its due
- EnL",144
15858,"Hence his system, as it holds that there is properly speaking no world, at any rate that the world has no positive being, should rather be styled Acosmism, These considerations will also show what is to be said of the charge of Pantheism
- EnL",243
15859,"If Pantheism means, as it often does, the doctrine which takes finite things in their finitude and in the complex of them to be God, we must acquit the system of Spinoza of the crime of Pantheism
- EnL",201
15860,"For in that system, finite things and the world as a whole are denied all truth
- EnL",85
15861,"On the other hand, the philosophy which is Acosmism is for that reason certainly pantheistic
- EnL",98
15862,"The shortcoming thus acknowledged to attach to the content turns out at the same time to be a shortcoming in respect of form
- EnL",130
15863,"Spinoza puts substance at the head of his system, and defines it to be the unity of thought and extension, without demonstrating how he gets to this distinction, or how he traces it back to the unity of substance
- EnL",218
15864,"The further treatment of the subject proceeds in what is called the mathematical method
- EnL",93
15865,"Definitions and axioms are first laid down: after them comes a series of theorems, which are proved by an analytical reduction of them to these unproved postulates
- EnL",169
15866,"Although the system of Spinoza, and that even by those who altogether reject its contents and results, is praised for the strict sequence of its method, such unqualified praise of the form is as little justified as an unqualified rejection of the content
- EnL",260
15867,"The defect of the content is that the form is not known as immanent in it, and therefore only approaches it as an outer and subjective form
- EnL",145
15870,"This is the correlation of Causality
- EnL",42
15872,"As primary fact, the cause is qualified as having absolute independence and a subsistence maintained in face of the effect: but in the necessity, whose identity constitutes that primariness itself, it is wholly passed into the effect
- EnL",239
15873,"So far again as we can speak of a definite content, there is no content in the effect that is not in the cause
- EnL",116
15874,"That identity in fact is the absolute content itself: but it is no less also the form-characteristic
- EnL",106
15875,"The primariness of the cause is suspended in the effect in which the cause makes itself a dependent being
- EnL",111
15876,"The cause however does not for that reason vanish and leave the effect to be alone actual
- EnL",95
15877,"For this dependency is in like manner directly suspended, and is rather the reflection of the cause in itself, its primariness: in short, it is in the effect that the cause first becomes actual and a cause
- EnL",211
15878,"The cause consequently is in its full truth causa sui--Jacobi, sticking to the partial conception of mediation (in his Letters on Spinoza, second edit
- EnL",156
15879,"He has also made the remark that God ought to be defined not as the ground of things, but essentially as cause
- EnL",116
15880,"A more thorough consideration of the nature of cause would have shown that Jacobi did not by this means gain what he intended
- EnL",131
15881,"Even in the finite cause and its conception we can see this identity between cause and effect in point of content
- EnL",119
15882,"The rain (the cause) and the wet (the effect) are the self-same existing water
- EnL",84
15883,"In point of form the cause (rain) is dissipated or lost in the effect (wet): but in that case the result can no longer be described as effect; for without the cause it is nothing, and we should have only the unrelated wet left
- EnL",232
15885,"In the finite sphere we never get over the difference of the form-characteristics in their relation: and hence we turn the matter round and define the cause also as something dependent or as an effect
- EnL",206
15886,"This again has another cause, and thus there grows up a progress from effects to causes ad infinitum
- EnL",106
15887,"There is a descending progress too: the effect, looked at in its identity with the cause, is itself defined as a cause, and at the same time as another cause, which again has other effects, and so on for ever
- EnL",214
15888,"The way understanding bristles up against the idea of substance is equalled by its readiness to use the relation of cause and effect
- EnL",138
15889,"Now, although this relation does undoubtedly belong to necessity, it forms only one aspect in the process of that category
- EnL",128
15890,"That process equally requires the suspension of the mediation involved in causality and the exhibition of it as simple self-relation
- EnL",138
15891,"If we stick to causality as such, we have it not in its truth
- EnL",67
15892,"Such a causality is merely finite, and its finitude lies in retaining the distinction between cause and effect unassimilated
- EnL",130
15893,"But these two terms, if they are distinct, are also identical
- EnL",67
15894,"Even in ordinary consciousness that identity may be found
- EnL",63
15895,"We say that a cause is a cause, only when it has an effect, and vice versâ
- EnL",80
15896,"Both cause and effect are thus one and the same content: and the distinction between them is primarily only that the one lays down, and the other is laid down
- EnL",164
15897,"This formal difference however again suspends itself, because the cause is not only a cause of something else, but also a cause of itself; while the effect is not only an effect of something else, but also an effect of itself
- EnL",231
15898,"The finitude of things consists accordingly in this
- EnL",57
15900,"This again gives the infinite progress, in the shape of an endless series of causes, which shows itself at the same time as an endless series of effects
- EnL",158
15901,"The effect is different from the cause
- EnL",44
15902,"The former as such has a being dependent on the latter
- EnL",60
15903,"But such a dependence is likewise reflection-into-self and immediacy: and the action of the cause, as it constitutes the effect, is at the same time the pre-constitution of the effect, so long as effect is kept separate from cause
- EnL",236
15904,"There is thus already in existence another substance on which the effect takes place
- EnL",90
15905,"As immediate, this substance is not a self-related negativity and active, but passive
- EnL",91
15906,"Yet it is a substance, and it is therefore active also: it therefore suspends the immediacy it was originally put forward with, and the effect which was put into it: it reacts, eg suspends the activity of the first substance
- EnL",230
15907,"But this first substance also in the same way sets aside its own immediacy, or the effect which is put into it; it thus suspends the activity of the other substance and reacts
- EnL",181
15908,"In this manner causality passes into the relation of Action and Reaction, or Reciprocity
- EnL",94
15910,"This bend, which transforms, the infinite progression into a self-contained relationship, is here as always the plain reflection that in the above meaningless repetition there is only one and the same thing, viz one cause and another, and their connexion with one another
- EnL",277
15912,"The characteristics which in Reciprocal Action are retained as distinct are (α) potentially the same
- EnL",106
15913,"The one side is a cause, is primary, active, passive, &c, just as the other is
- EnL",84
15914,"Similarly the pre-supposition of another side and the action upon it, the immediate primariness and the dependence produced by the alternation, are one and the same on both sides
- EnL",184
15915,"The cause assumed to be first is on account of its immediacy passive, a dependent being, and an effect
- EnL",108
15916,"The distinction of the causes spoken of as two is accordingly void: and properly speaking there is only one cause, which, while it suspends itself (as substance) in its effect, also rises in this operation only to independent existence as a cause
- EnL",252
15917,"But this unity of the double cause is also (β) actual
- EnL",59
15918,"All this alternation is properly the cause in act of constituting itself and in such constitution lies its being
- EnL",118
15919,"The nullity of the distinctions is not only potential, or a reflection of ours (§ 155)
- EnL",92
15920,"Reciprocal action just means that each characteristic we impose is also to be suspended and inverted into its opposite, and that in this way the essential nullity of the 'moments' is explicitly stated
- EnL",206
15921,"An effect is introduced into the primariness; in other words, the primariness is abolished: the action of a cause becomes reaction, and so on
- EnL",147
15922,"Reciprocal action realises the causal relation in its complete development
- EnL",80
15923,"It is this relation, therefore, in which reflection usually takes shelter when the conviction grows that things can no longer be studied satisfactorily from a causal point of view, on account of the infinite progress already spoken of
- EnL",240
15924,"Thus in historical research the question may be raised in a first form, whether the character and manners of a nation are the cause of its constitution and its laws, or if they are not rather the effect
- EnL",208
15925,"Then, as the second step, the character and manners on one side and the constitution and laws on the other are conceived on the principle of reciprocity: and in that case the cause in the same connexion as it is a cause will at the same time be an effect, and vice versâ
- EnL",276
15926,"The same thing is done in the study of Nature, and especially of living organisms
- EnL",87
15927,"There the several organs and functions are similarly seen to stand to each other in the relation of reciprocity
- EnL",117
15929,"If we get no further than studying a given content under the point of view of reciprocity, we are taking up an attitude which leaves matters utterly incomprehensible
- EnL",171
15930,"We are left with a mere dry fact; and the call for mediation, which is the chief motive in applying the relation of causality, is still unanswered
- EnL",152
15932,"And to understand the relation of action and reaction we must not let the two sides rest in their state of mere given facts, but recognise them, as has been shown in the two paragraphs preceding, for factors of a third and higher, which is the notion and nothing else
- EnL",273
15933,"To make, for example, the manners of the Spartans the cause of their constitution and their constitution conversely the cause of their manners, may no doubt be in a way correct
- EnL",182
15934,"But, as we have comprehended neither the manners nor the constitution of the nation, the result of such reflections can never be final or satisfactory
- EnL",156
15935,"The satisfactory point will be reached only when these two, as well as all other, special aspects of Spartan life and Spartan history are seen to be founded in this notion
- EnL",177
15936,"This pure self-reciprocation is therefore Necessity unveiled or realised
- EnL",78
15937,"The link of necessity quâ necessity is identity, as still inward and concealed, because it is the identity of what are esteemed actual things, although their very self-subsistence is bound to be necessity
- EnL",210
15940,"Here we have, first of all, some state or, generally speaking, fact, possessing an independent subsistence: and necessity primarily implies that there falls upon such a fact something else by which it is brought low
- EnL",221
15941,"This is what is hard and sad in necessity immediate or abstract
- EnL",69
15942,"The identity of the two things, which necessity presents as bound to each other and thus bereft of their independence, is at first only inward, and therefore has no existence for those under the yoke of necessity
- EnL",218
15943,"Freedom too from this point of view is only abstract, and is preserved only by renouncing all that we immediately are and have
- EnL",132
15944,"But, as we have seen already, the process of necessity is so directed that it overcomes the rigid externality which it first had and reveals its inward nature
- EnL",164
15945,"It then appears that the members, linked to one another, are not really foreign to each other, but only elements of one whole, each of them, in its connexion with the other, being, as it were, at home, and combining with itself
- EnL",233
15946,"In this way necessity is transfigured into freedom,--not the freedom that consists in abstract negation, but freedom concrete and positive
- EnL",144
15947,"From which we may learn what a mistake it is to regard freedom and necessity as mutually exclusive
- EnL",104
15948,"Necessity indeed quâ necessity is far from being freedom: yet freedom pre-supposes necessity, and contains it as an unsubstantial element in itself
- EnL",153
15949,"A good man is aware that the tenor of his conduct is essentially obligatory and necessary
- EnL",95
15950,"But this consciousness is so far from making any abatement from his freedom, that without it real and reasonable freedom could not be distinguished from arbitrary choice,--a freedom which has no reality and is merely potential
- EnL",232
15951,"A criminal, when punished, may look upon his punishment as a restriction of his freedom
- EnL",93
15952,"Really the punishment is not foreign constraint to which he is subjected, but the manifestation of his own act: and if he recognises this, he comports himself as a free man
- EnL",178
15953,"In short, man is most independent when he knows himself to be determined by the absolute idea throughout
- EnL",110
15954,"It was this phase of mind and conduct which Spinoza called Amor intellectualis Dei
- EnL",88
15955,"Thus the Notion is the truth of Being and Essence, inasmuch as the shining or show of self-reflection is itself at the same time independent immediacy, and this being of a different actuality is immediately only a shining or show on itself
- EnL",245
15956,"The Notion has exhibited itself as the truth of Being and Essence, as the ground to which the regress of both leads
- EnL",121
15957,"Conversely it has been developed out of being as its ground
- EnL",65
15958,"The former aspect of the advance may be regarded as a concentration of being into its depth, thereby disclosing its inner nature: the latter aspect as an issuing of the more perfect from the less perfect
- EnL",209
15959,"When such development is viewed on the latter side only, it does prejudice to the method of philosophy
- EnL",108
15960,"The special meaning which these superficial thoughts of more imperfect and more perfect have in this place is to indicate the distinction of being, as an immediate unity with itself, from the notion, as free mediation with itself
- EnL",235
15961,"Since being has shown that it is an element in the notion, the latter has thus exhibited itself as the truth of being
- EnL",123
15962,"As this its reflection in itself and as an absorption of the mediation, the notion is the pre-supposition of the immediate--a pre-supposition which is identical with the return to self; and in this identity lie freedom and the notion
- EnL",239
15963,"If the partial element therefore be called the imperfect, then the notion, or the perfect, is certainly a development from the imperfect; since its very nature is thus to suspend its pre-supposition
- EnL",204
15964,"At the same time it is the notion alone which, in the act of supposing itself, makes its pre-supposition; as has been made apparent in causality in general and especially in reciprocal action
- EnL",197
15965,"Thus in reference to Being and Essence the Notion is defined as Essence reverted to the simple immediacy of Being,--the shining or show of Essence thereby having actuality, and its actuality being at the same time a free shining or show in itself
- EnL",252
15966,"In this manner the notion has being as its simple self-relation, or as the immediacy of its immanent unity
- EnL",112
15967,"Being is so poor a category that it is the least thing which can be shown to be found in the notion
- EnL",105
15968,"The passage from necessity to freedom, or from actuality into the notion, is the very hardest, because it proposes that independent actuality shall be thought as having all its substantiality in the passing over and identity with the other independent actuality
- EnL",267
15969,"The notion, too, is extremely hard, because it is itself just this very identity
- EnL",86
15970,"But the actual substance as such, the cause, which in its exclusiveness resists all invasion, is ipso facto subjected to necessity or the destiny of passing into dependency: and it is this subjection rather where the chief hardness lies
- EnL",242
15971,"To think necessity, on the contrary, rather tends to melt that hardness
- EnL",77
15974,"The answer is that, where knowledge by thought is our aim, we cannot begin with the truth, because the truth, when it forms the beginning, must rest on mere assertion
- EnL",172
15975,"The truth when it is thought must as such verify itself to thought
- EnL",72
15976,"But if we answered these questions, then our beginning with the notion would be merely nominal
- EnL",100
15978,"The Notion is the principle of freedom, the power of substance self-realised
- EnL",82
15979,"It is a systematic whole, in which each of its constituent functions is the very total which the notion is, and is put as indissolubly one with it
- EnL",152
15980,"Thus in its self-identity it has original and complete determinateness
- EnL",76
15981,"The position taken up by the notion is that of absolute idealism
- EnL",70
15982,"Philosophy is a knowledge through notions because it sees that what on other grades of consciousness is taken to have Being, and to be naturally or immediately independent, is but a constituent stage in the Idea
- EnL",217
15983,"In the logic of understanding, the notion is generally reckoned a mere form of thought, and treated as a general conception
- EnL",129
15984,"It is to this inferior view of the notion that the assertion refers, so often urged on behalf of the heart and sentiment, that notions as such are something dead, empty, and abstract
- EnL",188
15985,"The case is really quite the reverse
- EnL",42
15986,"The notion is, on the contrary, the principle of all life, and thus possesses at the same time a character of thorough concreteness
- EnL",137
15987,"That it is so follows from the whole logical movement up to this point, and need not be here proved
- EnL",105
15988,"The contrast between form and content, which is thus used to criticise the notion when it is alleged to be merely formal, has, like all the other contrasts upheld by reflection, been already left behind and overcome dialectically or through itself
- EnL",253
15989,"The notion, in short, is what contains all the earlier categories of thought merged in it
- EnL",95
15990,"It certainly is a form, but an infinite and creative form, which includes, but at the same time releases from itself, the fulness of all content
- EnL",150
15991,"And so too the notion may, if it be wished, be styled abstract, if the name concrete is restricted to the concrete facts of sense or of immediate perception
- EnL",162
15992,"For the notion is not palpable to the touch, and when we are engaged with it, hearing and seeing must quite fail us
- EnL",121
15993,"And yet, as it was before remarked, the notion is a true concrete; for the reason that it involves Being and Essence, and the total wealth of these two spheres with them, merged in the unity of thought
- EnL",207
15994,"If, as was said at an earlier point, the different stages of the logical idea are to be treated as a series of definitions of the Absolute, the definition which now results for us is that the Absolute is the Notion
- EnL",220
15995,"That necessitates a higher estimate of the notion, however, than is found in formal conceptualist Logic, where the notion is a mere form of our subjective thought, with no original content of its own
- EnL",205
15996,"But if Speculative Logic thus attaches a meaning to the term notion so very different from that usually given, it may be asked why the same word should be employed in two contrary acceptations, and an occasion thus given for confusion and misconception
- EnL",258
15997,"The answer is that, great as the interval is between the speculative notion and the notion of Formal Logic, a closer examination shows that the deeper meaning is not so foreign to the general usages of language as it seems at first sight
- EnL",243
15998,"The onward movement of the notion is no longer either a transition into, or a reflection on something else, but Development
- EnL",129
15999,"For in the notion, the elements distinguished are without more ado at the same time declared to be identical with one another and with the whole, and the specific character of each is a free being of the whole notion
- EnL",222
16000,"The movement of the Notion is development: by which that only is explicit which is already implicitly present
- EnL",115
16001,"In the world of nature it is organic life that corresponds to the grade of the notion
- EnL",91
16002,"Thus eg the plant is developed from its germ
- EnL",50
16004,"That is the so-called 'box-within-box' hypothesis; a theory which commits the mistake of supposing an actual existence of what is at first found only as a postulate of the completed thought
- EnL",195
16005,"The truth of the hypothesis on the other hand lies in its perceiving that in the process of development the notion keeps to itself and only gives rise to alteration of form, without making any addition in point of content
- EnL",227
16006,"It is this nature of the notion--this manifestation of itself in its process as a development of its own self,--which is chiefly in view with those who speak of innate ideas, or who, like Plato, describe all learning merely as reminiscence
- EnL",245
16007,"Of course that again does not mean that everything which is embodied in a mind, after that mind has been formed by instruction, had been present in that mind beforehand, in its definitely expanded shape
- EnL",208
16008,"The movement of the notion is as it were to be looked upon merely as play: the other which it sets up is in reality not an other
- EnL",134
16009,"Or, as it is expressed in the teaching of Christianity: not merely has God created a world which confronts Him as an other; He has also from all eternity begotten a Son in whom He, a Spirit, is at home with Himself
- EnL",220
16010,"The doctrine of the notion is divided into three parts
- EnL",60
16011,"The Common Logic covers only the matters which come before us here as a portion of the third part of the whole system, together with the so-called Laws of Thought, which we have already met; and in the Applied Logic it adds a little about cognition
- EnL",254
16012,"This is combined with psychological, metaphysical, and all sorts of empirical materials, which were introduced because, when all was done, those forms of thought could not be made to do all that was required of them
- EnL",221
16013,"But with these additions the science lost its unity of aim
- EnL",64
16014,"Then there was a further circumstance against the Common Logic
- EnL",68
16015,"Those forms, which at least do belong to the proper domain of Logic, are supposed to be categories of conscious thought only, of thought too in the character of understanding, not of reason
- EnL",195
16016,"The preceding logical categories, those viz of Being and Essence, are, it is true, no mere logical modes or entities: they are proved to be notions in their transition or their dialectical element, and in their return into themselves and totality
- EnL",252
16017,"But they are only in a modified form notions (cp
- EnL",54
16018,"The antithetical term into which each category passes, or in which it shines, so producing correlation, is not characterised as a particular
- EnL",146
16020,"The Logic of the Notion is usually treated as a science of form only, and understood to deal with the form of notion, judgment, and syllogism as form, without in the least touching the question whether anything is true
- EnL",224
16021,"The answer to that question is supposed to depend on the content only
- EnL",75
16022,"If the logical forms of the notion were really dead and inert receptacles of conceptions and thoughts, careless of what they contained, knowledge about them would be an idle curiosity which the truth might dispense with
- EnL",225
16023,"On the contrary they really are, as forms of the notion, the vital spirit of the actual world
- EnL",99
16024,"That only is true of the actual which is true in virtue of these forms, through them and in them
- EnL",102
16025,"As yet, however, the truth of these forms has never been considered or examined on their own account any more than their necessary interconnexion
- EnL",151
16026,"The Notion as Notion contains the three following 'moments' or functional parts
- EnL",85
16027,"Individual and actual are the same thing: only the former has issued from the notion, and is thus, as a universal, stated expressly as a negative identity with itself
- EnL",172
16029,"Every function and 'moment' of the notion is itself the whole notion (§ 160); but the individual or subject is the notion expressly put as a totality
- EnL",155
16030,"This is the aspect of the notion which is familiar to understanding; and feeling is in the right when it stigmatises such hollow and empty notions as mere phantoms and shadows
- EnL",181
16031,"But the universal of the notion is not a mere sum of features common to several things, confronted by a particular which enjoys an existence of its own
- EnL",157
16032,"It is, on the contrary, self-particularising or self-specifying, and with undimmed clearness finds itself at home in its antithesis
- EnL",137
16033,"For the sake both of cognition and of our practical conduct, it is of the utmost importance that the real universal should not be confused with what is merely held in common
- EnL",179
16034,"All those charges which the devotees of feeling make against thought, and especially against philosophic thought, and the reiterated statement that it is dangerous to carry thought to what they call too great lengths, originate in the confusion of these two things
- EnL",270
16035,"The universal in its true and comprehensive meaning is a thought which, as we know, cost thousands of years to make it enter into the consciousness of men
- EnL",160
16036,"The thought did not gain its full recognition till the days of Christianity
- EnL",81
16037,"The Greeks, in other respects so advanced, knew neither God nor even man in their true universality
- EnL",105
16038,"The gods of the Greeks were only particular powers of the mind; and the universal God, the God of all nations, was to the Athenians still a God concealed
- EnL",159
16039,"They believed in the same way that an absolute gulf separated themselves from the barbarians
- EnL",98
16040,"Man as man was not then recognised to be of infinite worth and to have infinite rights
- EnL",92
16041,"The question has been asked, why slavery has vanished from modern Europe
- EnL",78
16042,"One special circumstance after another has been adduced in explanation of this phenomenon
- EnL",95
16043,"But the real ground why there are no more slaves in Christian Europe is only to be found in the very principle of Christianity itself, the religion of absolute freedom
- EnL",173
16044,"Only in Christendom is man respected as man, in his infinitude and universality
- EnL",85
16045,"What the slave is without, is the recognition that he is a person: and the principle of personality is universality
- EnL",121
16046,"The master looks upon his slave not as a person, but as a selfless thing
- EnL",78
16047,"The slave is not himself reckoned an 'I';--his 'I' is his master

16049,"Rousseau would have made a sounder contribution towards a theory of the state, if he had always keep this distinction in sight
- EnL",132
16050,"The general will is the notion of the will: and the laws are the special clauses of this will and based upon the notion of it
- EnL",131
16051,"It is not we who frame the notions
- EnL",40
16052,"The notion is not something which is originated at all
- EnL",60
16053,"No doubt the notion is not mere Being, or the immediate: it involves mediation, but the mediation lies in itself
- EnL",118
16054,"In other words, the notion is what is mediated through itself and with itself
- EnL",83
16056,"Rather the notion is the genuine first; and things are what they are through the action of the notion, immanent in them, and revealing itself in them
- EnL",155
16057,"In religious language we express this by saying that God created the world out of nothing
- EnL",95
16058,"In other words, the world and finite things have issued from the fulness of the divine thoughts and the divine decrees
- EnL",124
16059,"Thus religion recognises thought and (more exactly) the notion to be the infinite form, or the free creative activity, which can realise itself without the help of a matter that exists outside it
- EnL",201
16060,"The notion is concrete out and out: because the negative unity with itself, as characterisation pure and entire, which is individuality, is just what constitutes its self-relation, its universality
- EnL",203
16061,"The functions or 'moments' of the notion are to this extent indissoluble
- EnL",78
16062,"The categories of 'reflection' are expected to be severally apprehended and separately accepted as current, apart from their opposites
- EnL",140
16063,"But in the notion, where their identity is expressly assumed, each of its functions can be immediately apprehended only from and with the rest
- EnL",148
16064,"Universality, particularity, and individuality are, taken in the abstract, the same as identity, difference, and ground
- EnL",125
16065,"But the universal is the self-identical, with the express qualification, that it simultaneously contains the particular and the individual
- EnL",144
16066,"Again, the particular is the different or the specific character, but with the qualification that it is in itself universal and is as an individual
- EnL",153
16067,"Similarly the individual must be understood to be a subject or substratum, which involves the genus and species in itself and possesses a substantial existence
- EnL",165
16068,"Such is the explicit or realised inseparability of the functions of the notion in their difference (§ 160)--what may be called the clearness of the notion, in which each distinction causes no dimness or interruption, but is quite as much transparent
- EnL",255
16069,"No complaint is oftener made against the notion than that it is abstract
- EnL",78
16070,"Of course it is abstract, if abstract means that the medium in which the notion exists is thought in general and not the sensible thing in its empirical concreteness
- EnL",171
16071,"It is abstract also, because the notion falls short of the idea
- EnL",69
16072,"To this extent the subjective notion is still formal
- EnL",58
16073,"This however does not mean that it ought to have or receive another content than its own
- EnL",94
16074,"It is itself the absolute form, and so is all specific character, but as that character is in its truth
- EnL",109
16075,"Although it be abstract therefore, it is the concrete, concrete altogether, the subject as such
- EnL",101
16076,"The absolutely concrete is the mind (see end of § 159)--the notion when it exists as notion distinguishing itself from its objectivity, which notwithstanding the distinction still continues to be its own
- EnL",209
16078,"These abstractions retain out of all the functions of the notion only that of universality; they leave particularity and individuality out of account and have no development in these directions
- EnL",199
16079,"By so doing they just miss the notion
- EnL",43
16080,"It is the element of Individuality which first explicitly differentiates the elements of the notion
- EnL",105
16081,"Individuality is the negative reflection of the notion into itself, and it is in that way at first the free differentiating of it as the first negation, by which the specific character of the notion is realised, but under the form of particularity
- EnL",253
16082,"That is to say, the different elements are in the first place only qualified as the several elements of the notion, and, secondly, their identity is no less explicitly stated, the one being said to be the other
- EnL",216
16083,"This realised particularity of the notion is the Judgment
- EnL",63
16084,"The ordinary classification of notions, as clear, distinct and adequate, is no part of the notion; it belongs to psychology
- EnL",129
16085,"Notions, in fact, are here synonymous with mental representations; a clear notion is an abstract simple representation: a distinct notion is one where, in addition to the simplicity, there is one 'mark' or character emphasised as a sign for subjective cognition
- EnL",267
16086,"There is no more striking mark of the formalism and decay of Logic than the favourite category of the 'mark'
- EnL",114
16089,"The true distinctions in the notion, universal, particular, and individual, may be said also to constitute species of it, but only when they are kept severed from each other by external reflection
- EnL",202
16090,"The immanent differentiating and specifying of the notion come to sight in the judgment: for to judge is to specify the notion
- EnL",132
16091,"The Judgment is the notion in its particularity, as a connexion which is also a distinguishing of its functions, which are put as independent and yet as identical with themselves, not with one another
- EnL",206
16092,"One's first impression about the Judgment is the independence of the two extremes, the subject and the predicate
- EnL",118
16093,"The former we take to be a thing or term per se, and the predicate a general term outside the said subject and somewhere in our heads
- EnL",139
16094,"The next point is for us to bring the latter into combination with the former, and in this way frame a Judgment
- EnL",117
16096,"And that is what the Judgment really is
- EnL",45
16097,"In its abstract terms a Judgment is expressible in the proposition: 'The individual is the universal'
- EnL",107
16098,"These are the terms under which the subject and the predicate first confront each other, when the functions of the notion are taken in their immediate character or first abstraction
- EnL",187
16099,"Propositions such as, 'The particular is the universal,' and 'The individual is the particular,' belong to the further specialisation of the judgment
- EnL",155
16101,"No doubt there is also a distinction between terms like individual and universal, subject and predicate: but it is none the less the universal fact, that every judgment states them to be identical
- EnL",202
16102,"The copula 'is' springs from the nature of the notion, to be self-identical even in parting with its own
- EnL",110
16103,"The individual and universal are its constituents, and therefore characters which cannot be isolated
- EnL",106
16104,"The earlier categories (of reflection) in their correlations also refer to one another: but their interconnexion is only 'having' and not 'being,' ie it is not the identity which is realised as identity or universality
- EnL",224
16105,"In the judgment, therefore, for the first time there is seen the genuine particularity of the notion: for it is the speciality or distinguishing of the latter, without thereby losing universality
- EnL",201
16106,"This theory of judgment is correct, so far as it implies that it is the notion which forms the presupposition of the judgment, and which in the judgment comes up under the form of difference
- EnL",196
16107,"But on the other hand, it is false to speak of notions differing in kind
- EnL",78
16108,"The notion, although concrete, is still as a notion essentially one, and the functions which it contains are not different kinds of it
- EnL",140
16109,"It is equally false to speak of a combination of the two sides in the judgment, if we understand the term 'combination' to imply the independent existence of the combining members apart from the combination
- EnL",212
16110,"The same external view of their nature is more forcibly apparent when judgments are described as produced by the ascription of a predicate to the subject
- EnL",159
16111,"Language like this looks upon the subject as self-subsistent outside, and the predicate as found somewhere in our head
- EnL",124
16112,"Such a conception of the relation between subject and predicate however is at once contradicted by the copula 'is'
- EnL",120
16113,"By saying 'This rose is red,' or 'This picture is beautiful,' we declare, that it is not we who from outside attach beauty to the picture or redness to the rose, but that these are the characteristics proper to these objects
- EnL",230
16114,"An additional fault in the way in which Formal Logic conceives the judgment is, that it makes the judgment look as if it were something merely contingent, and does not offer any proof for the advance from notion on to judgment
- EnL",232
16115,"For the notion does not, as understanding supposes, stand still in its own immobility
- EnL",91
16116,"It is rather an infinite form, of boundless activity, as it were the punctum saliens of all vitality, and thereby self-differentiating
- EnL",140
16117,"This disruption of the notion into the difference of its constituent functions',--a disruption imposed by the native act of the notion, is the judgment
- EnL",157
16118,"A judgment therefore means the particularising of the notion
- EnL",66
16119,"No doubt the notion is implicitly the particular
- EnL",54
16120,"But in the notion as notion the particular is not yet explicit, and still remains in transparent unity with the universal
- EnL",127
16121,"Thus, for example, as we remarked before (§ 160, note), the germ of a plant contains its particular, such as root, branches, leaves, &c: but these details are at first present only potentially, and are not realised till the germ uncloses
- EnL",243
16122,"This unclosing is, as it were, the judgment of the plant
- EnL",62
16123,"The illustration may also serve to show how neither the notion nor the judgment are merely found in our head, or merely framed by us
- EnL",138
16124,"The notion is the very heart of things, and makes them what they are
- EnL",74
16125,"To form a notion of an object means therefore to become aware of its notion: and when we proceed to a criticism or judgment of the object, we are not performing a subjective act, and merely ascribing this or that predicate to the object
- EnL",242
16126,"We are, on the contrary, observing the object in the specific character imposed by its notion
- EnL",99
16127,"The Judgment is usually taken in a subjective sense as an operation and a form, occurring merely in self-conscious thought
- EnL",128
16128,"This distinction, however, has no existence on purely logical principles, by which the judgment is taken in the quite universal signification that all things are a judgment
- EnL",178
16129,"That is to say, they are individuals, which are a universality or inner nature in themselves,--a universal which is individualised
- EnL",136
16130,"Their universality and individuality are distinguished, but the one is at the same time identical with the other
- EnL",118
16131,"The interpretation of the judgment, according to which it is assumed to be merely subjective, as if we ascribed a predicate to a subject, is contradicted by the decidedly objective expression of the judgment
- EnL",213
16132,"The rose is red; Gold is a metal
- EnL",38
16133,"It is not by us that something is first ascribed to them--A judgment is however distinguished from a proposition
- EnL",118
16134,"The latter contains a statement about the subject, which does not stand to it in any universal relationship, but expresses some single action, or some state, or the like
- EnL",175
16135,"Thus, 'Caesar was born at Rome in such and such a year, waged war in Gaul for ten years, crossed the Rubicon, &c,' are propositions, but not judgments
- EnL",156
16136,"Again it is absurd to say that such statements as, 'I slept well last night,' or 'Present arms!'
- EnL",102
16137,"The judgment is an expression of finitude
- EnL",47
16139,"The abstract terms of the judgment, 'The individual is the universal,' present the subject (as negatively self-relating) as what is immediately concrete, while the predicate is what is abstract, indeterminate, in short, the universal
- EnL",239
16141,"It is the predicate which first gives the subject, which till then was on its own account a bare mental representation or an empty name, its specific character and content
- EnL",177
16142,"In judgments like 'God is the most real of all things,' or 'The Absolute is the self-identical,' God and the Absolute are mere names; what they are we only learn in the predicate
- EnL",184
16143,"What the subject may be in other respects, as a concrete thing, is no concern of this judgment
- EnL",100
16144,"To define the subject as that of which something is said, and the predicate as what is said about it, is mere trifling
- EnL",124
16145,"It gives no information about the distinction between the two
- EnL",67
16146,"In point of thought, the subject is primarily the individual, and the predicate the universal
- EnL",99
16148,"Thus while the same names are given to the two terms of the judgment, their meaning passes through a series of changes
- EnL",124
16149,"We now go closer into the speciality of subject and predicate
- EnL",67
16150,"The subject as negative self-relation (§§ 163, 166) is the stable substratum in which the predicate has its subsistence and where it is ideally present
- EnL",157
16151,"The predicate, as the phrase is, inheres in the subject
- EnL",61
16152,"Further, as the subject is in general and immediately concrete, the specific connotation of the predicate is only one of the numerous characters of the subject
- EnL",165
16153,"Thus the subject is ampler and wider than the predicate
- EnL",61
16154,"Conversely, the predicate as universal is self-subsistent, and indifferent whether this subject is or not
- EnL",111
16155,"The predicate outflanks the subject, subsuming it under itself: and hence on its side is wider than the subject
- EnL",117
16156,"The specific content of the predicate (§ 169) alone constitutes the identity of the two
- EnL",93
16157,"At first, subject, predicate, and the specific content or the identity are, even in their relation, still put in the judgment as different and divergent
- EnL",158
16158,"By implication, however, that is, in their notion, they are identical
- EnL",75
16160,"Conformably to such an identity the subject has to be put also in the characteristic of the predicate
- EnL",107
16161,"By this means the latter also receives the characteristic of the former: so that the copula receives its full complement and full force
- EnL",141
16162,"Such is the continuous specification by which the judgment, through a copula charged with content, comes to be a syllogism
- EnL",128
16163,"As it is primarily exhibited in the judgment, this gradual specification consists in giving to an originally abstract, sensuous universality the specific character of allness, of species, of genus, and finally of the developed universality of the notion
- EnL",259
16164,"After we are made aware of this continuous specification of the judgment, we can see a meaning and an interconnexion in what are usually stated as the kinds of judgment
- EnL",174
16165,"Not only does the ordinary enumeration seem purely casual, but it is also superficial, and even bewildering in its statement of their distinctions
- EnL",152
16166,"The distinction between positive, categorical and assertory judgments, is either a pure invention of fancy, or is left undetermined
- EnL",137
16167,"On the right theory, the different judgments follow necessarily from one another, and present the continuous specification of the notion; for the judgment itself is nothing but the notion specified
- EnL",203
16168,"They are a systematic whole based on a principle; and it was one of Kant's great merits to have first emphasised the necessity of showing this
- EnL",148
16169,"His proposed division, according to the headings in his table of categories, into judgments of quality, quantity, relation and modality, can not be called satisfactory, partly from the merely formal application of this categorical rubric, partly on account of their content
- EnL",279
16170,"Still it rests upon a true perception of the fact that the different species of judgment derive their features from the universal forms of the logical idea itself
- EnL",168
16171,"If we follow this clue, it will supply us with three chief kinds of judgment parallel to the stages of Being, Essence, and Notion
- EnL",135
16172,"The second of these kinds, as required by the character of Essence, which is the stage of differentiation, must be doubled
- EnL",128
16174,"The notion itself meanwhile is seen to mould and form the genuine grade of judgment
- EnL",89
16175,"Far from occupying the same level, and being of equal value, the different species of judgment form a series of steps, the difference of which rests upon the logical significance of the predicate
- EnL",201
16176,"That judgments differ in value is evident even in our ordinary ways of thinking
- EnL",85
16177,"We should not hesitate to ascribe a very slight faculty of judgment to a person who habitually framed only such judgments as, 'This wall is green,' 'This stove is hot'
- EnL",173
16178,"On the other hand we should credit with a genuine capacity of judgment the person whose criticisms dealt with such questions as whether a certain work of art was beautiful, whether a certain action was good, and so on
- EnL",223
16179,"In judgments of the first-mentioned kind the content forms only an abstract quality, the presence of which can be sufficiently detected by immediate perception
- EnL",165
16180,"To pronounce a work of art to be beautiful, or an action to be good, requires on the contrary a comparison of the objects with what they ought to be, ie with their notion
- EnL",176
16181,"The immediate judgment is the judgment of definite Being
- EnL",62
16182,"The subject is invested with a universality as its predicate, which is an immediate, and therefore a sensible quality
- EnL",123
16183,"It may be (1) a Positive judgment: The individual is a particular
- EnL",71
16184,"But the individual is not a particular: or in more precise language, such a single quality is not congruous with the concrete nature of the subject
- EnL",153
16185,"This is (2) a Negative judgment
- EnL",37
16186,"It is one of the fundamental assumptions of dogmatic Logic that Qualitative judgments such as, 'The rose is red,' or 'is not red,' can contain truth
- EnL",154
16187,"Correct they may be, ie in the limited circle of perception, of finite conception and thought: that depends on the content, which likewise is finite, and, on its own merits, untrue
- EnL",186
16188,"Truth, however, as opposed to correctness, depends solely on the form, viz on the notion as it is put and the reality corresponding to it
- EnL",143
16189,"But truth of that stamp is not found in the Qualitative judgment
- EnL",70
16190,"In common life the terms truth and correctness are often treated as synonymous: we speak of the truth of a content, when we are only thinking of its correctness
- EnL",166
16191,"Correctness, generally speaking, concerns only the formal coincidence between our conception and its content, whatever the constitution of this content may be
- EnL",164
16192,"Truth, on the contrary, lies in the coincidence of the object with itself, that is, with its notion
- EnL",105
16193,"That a person is sick, or that some one has committed a theft, may certainly be correct
- EnL",93
16194,"But the content is untrue
- EnL",31
16195,"A sick body is not in harmony with the notion of body, and there is a want of congruity between theft and the notion of human conduct
- EnL",139
16196,"These instances may show that an immediate judgment, in which an abstract quality is predicated of an immediately individual thing, however correct it may be, cannot contain truth
- EnL",185
16197,"The subject and predicate of it do not stand to each other in the relation of reality and notion
- EnL",102
16198,"We may add that the untruth of the immediate judgment lies in the incongruity between its form and content
- EnL",112
16199,"To say 'This rose is red,' involves (in virtue of the copula 'is') the coincidence of subject and predicate
- EnL",113
16200,"The rose however is a concrete thing, and so is not red only: it has also an odour, a specific form, and many other features not implied in the predicate red
- EnL",163
16201,"The predicate on its part is an abstract universal, and does not apply to the rose alone
- EnL",94
16202,"There are other flowers and other objects which are red too
- EnL",65
16203,"The subject and predicate in the immediate judgment touch, as it were, only in a single point, but do not cover each other
- EnL",128
16204,"The case is different with the notional judgment
- EnL",54
16205,"In pronouncing an action to be good, we frame a notional judgment
- EnL",71
16206,"Here, as we at once perceive, there is a closer and a more intimate relation than in the immediate judgment
- EnL",113
16207,"The predicate in the latter is some abstract quality which may or may not be applied to the subject
- EnL",105
16208,"In the judgment of the notion the predicate is, as it were, the soul of the subject, by which the subject, as the body of this soul, is characterised through and through
- EnL",175
16209,"This negation of a particular quality, which is the first negation, still leaves the connexion of the subject with the predicate subsisting
- EnL",145
16210,"The predicate is in that manner a sort of relative universal, of which a special phase only has been negatived
- EnL",116
16211,"To say, that the rose is not red, implies that it is still coloured--in the first place with another colour; which however would be only one more positive judgment
- EnL",169
16212,"The individual however is not a universal
- EnL",47
16213,"Hence (3) the judgment suffers disruption into one of two forms
- EnL",69
16214,"It is either (a) the Identical judgment, an empty identical relation stating that the individual is the individual; or it is (b) what is called the Infinite judgment, in which we are presented with the total incompatibility of subject and predicate
- EnL",254
16215,"Examples of the latter are: 'The mind is no elephant:' 'A lion is no table;' propositions which are correct but absurd, exactly like the identical propositions: 'A lion is a lion;' 'Mind is mind'
- EnL",201
16216,"Propositions like these are undoubtedly the truth of the immediate, or, as it is called, Qualitative judgment
- EnL",115
16218,"But the infinite judgment is not really a mere casual form adopted by subjective thought
- EnL",94
16219,"It exhibits the proximate result of the dialectical process in the immediate judgments preceding (the positive and simply-negative), and distinctly displays their finitude and untruth
- EnL",189
16220,"Crime may be quoted as an objective instance of the negatively-infinite judgment
- EnL",86
16221,"The person committing a crime, such as a theft, does not, as in a suit about civil rights, merely deny the particular right of another person to some one definite thing
- EnL",174
16222,"He denies the right of that person in general, and therefore he is not merely forced to restore what he has stolen, but is punished in addition, because he has violated law as law, ie law in general
- EnL",204
16223,"The civil-law suit on the contrary is an instance of the negative judgment pure and simple where merely the particular law is violated, whilst law in general is so far acknowledged
- EnL",186
16224,"Such a dispute is precisely paralleled by a negative judgment, like, 'This flower is not red:' by which we merely deny the particular colour of the flower, but not its colour in general, which may be blue, yellow, or any other
- EnL",232
16225,"Similarly death, as a negatively-infinite judgment, is distinguished from disease as simply-negative
- EnL",106
16226,"In disease, merely this or that function of life is checked or negatived: in death, as we ordinarily say, body and soul part, ie subject and predicate utterly diverge
- EnL",172
16228,"In this way the universality of the predicate comes to signify this relativity--(eg) useful, or dangerous; weight or acidity; or again, instinct; are examples of such relative predicates
- EnL",192
16229,"The Judgment of Reflection is distinguished from the Qualitative judgment by the circumstance that its predicate is not an immediate or abstract quality, but of such a kind as to exhibit the subject as in relation to something else
- EnL",237
16230,"When we say, eg 'This rose is red'
- EnL",40
16231,"If, on the other hand, we frame the judgment, 'This plant is medicinal,' we regard the subject, plant, as standing in connexion with something else (the sickness which it cures), by means of its predicate (its medicinality)
- EnL",229
16232,"The case is the same with judgments like: This body is elastic: This instrument is useful: This punishment has a deterrent influence
- EnL",138
16233,"In every one of these instances the predicate is some category of reflection
- EnL",82
16234,"They all exhibit an advance beyond the immediate individuality of the subject, but none of them goes so far as to indicate the adequate notion of it
- EnL",154
16235,"It is in this mode of judgment that ordinary raisonnement luxuriates
- EnL",74
16236,"The greater the concreteness of the object in question, the more points of view does it offer to reflection; by which however its proper nature or notion is not exhausted
- EnL",176
16237,"But (2) secondly, in this relation it is elevated above its singularity
- EnL",77
16238,"This enlargement is external, due to subjective reflection, and at first is an indefinite number of particulars
- EnL",117
16239,"To say, 'This plant is wholesome,' implies not only that this single plant is wholesome, but that some or several are so
- EnL",126
16240,"We have thus the particular judgment (some plants are wholesome, some men are inventive, &c)
- EnL",98
16241,"By means of particularity the immediate individual comes to lose its independence, and enters into an inter-connexion with something else
- EnL",143
16242,"Man, as this man, is not this single man alone: he stands beside other men and becomes one in the crowd, just by this means however he belongs to his universal, and is consequently raised--The particular judgment is as much negative as positive
- EnL",250
16243,"If only some bodies are elastic, it is evident that the rest are not elastic
- EnL",82
16244,"On this fact again depends the advance to the third form of the Reflective judgment, viz the judgment of allness (all men are mortal, all metals conduct electricity)
- EnL",171
16245,"It is as 'all' that the universal is in the first instance generally encountered by reflection
- EnL",100
16246,"The individuals form for reflection the foundation, and it is only our subjective action which collects and describes them as 'all'
- EnL",137
16247,"So far the universal has the aspect of an external fastening, that holds together a number of independent individuals, which have not the least affinity towards it
- EnL",169
16248,"This semblance of indifference is however unreal: for the universal is the ground and foundation, the root, and substance of the individual
- EnL",145
16249,"If eg we take Caius, Titus, Sempronius, and the other inhabitants of a town or country, the fact that all of them are men is not merely something which they have in common, but their universal or kind, without which these individuals would not be at all
- EnL",259
16250,"The case is very different with that superficial generality falsely so called, which really means only what attaches, or is common, to all the individuals
- EnL",160
16251,"It has been remarked, for example, that men, in contradistinction from the lower animals, possess in common the appendage of ear-lobes
- EnL",140
16253,"And that generality is not something external to, or something in addition to other abstract qualities, or to mere features discovered by reflection
- EnL",154
16254,"It is what permeates and includes in it everything particular
- EnL",67
16255,"The subject being thus likewise characterised as a universal, there is an express identification of subject and predicate, by which at the same time the speciality of the judgment form is deprived of all importance
- EnL",220
16256,"This unity of the content (the content being the universality which is identical with the negative reflection-in-self of the subject) makes the connexion in judgment a necessary one
- EnL",187
16257,"The advance from the reflective judgment of allness to the judgment of necessity is found in our usual modes of thought, when we say that whatever appertains to all, appertains to the species, and is therefore necessary
- EnL",225
16258,"To say all plants, or all men, is the same thing as to say the plant, or the man
- EnL",86
16260,"This is the Categorical judgment
- EnL",38
16261,"Their identity is then inward only; and thus the actuality of the one is at the same time not its own, but the being of the other
- EnL",135
16262,"This is the Hypothetical judgment
- EnL",39
16263,"This judgment, which has this universal for both its terms, the one time as a universal, the other time as the circle of its self-excluding particularisation in which the 'either--or' as much as the 'as well as' stands for the genus, is the Disjunctive judgment
- EnL",267
16264,"Universality, at first as a genus, and now also as the circuit of its species, is thus described and expressly put as a totality
- EnL",134
16265,"All things are a Categorical judgment
- EnL",43
16266,"In other words, they have their substantial nature, forming their fixed and unchangeable substratum
- EnL",105
16267,"It is only when things are studied from the point of view of their kind, and as with necessity determined by the kind, that the judgment first begins to be real
- EnL",166
16268,"It betrays a defective logical training to place upon the same level judgments like 'gold is dear,' and judgments like 'gold is a metal'
- EnL",142
16269,"That 'gold is dear' is a matter of external connexion between it and our wants or inclinations, the costs of obtaining it, and other circumstances
- EnL",152
16270,"Gold remains the same as it was, though that external reference is altered or removed
- EnL",91
16271,"Metalleity, on the contrary, constitutes the substantial nature of gold, apart from which it, and all else that is in it, or can be predicated of it, would be unable to subsist
- EnL",182
16272,"The same is the case if we say, 'Caius is a man'
- EnL",54
16273,"We express by that, that whatever else he may be, has worth and meaning, only when it corresponds to his substantial nature or manhood
- EnL",140
16274,"But even the Categorical judgment is to a certain extent defective
- EnL",72
16275,"It fails to give due place to the function or element of particularity
- EnL",76
16276,"Thus 'gold is a metal,' it is true; but so are silver, copper, iron: and metalleity as such has no leanings to any of its particular species
- EnL",146
16277,"In these circumstances we must advance from the Categorical to the Hypothetical judgment, which may be expressed in the formula: If A is, B is
- EnL",148
16278,"The present case exhibits the same advance as formerly took place from the relation of substance to the relation of cause
- EnL",127
16279,"In the Hypothetical judgment the specific character of the content shows itself mediated and dependent on something else: and this is exactly the relation of cause and effect
- EnL",180
16280,"And if we were to give a general interpretation to the Hypothetical judgment, we should say that it expressly realises the universal in its particularising
- EnL",161
16281,"This brings us to the third form of the Judgment of Necessity, the Disjunctive judgment
- EnL",93
16282,"A is either B or C or D A work of poetic art is either epic or lyric or dramatic
- EnL",86
16283,"Colour is either yellow or blue or red
- EnL",44
16284,"The two terms in the Disjunctive judgment are identical
- EnL",61
16285,"The genus is the sum total of the species, and the sum total of the species is the genus
- EnL",94
16286,"This unity of the universal and the particular is the notion: and it is the notion which, as we now see, forms the content of the judgment
- EnL",144
16287,"The Judgment of the Notion has for its content the notion, the totality in simple form, the universal with its complete speciality
- EnL",136
16288,"The subject is, (1) in the first place, an individual, which has for its predicate the reflection of the particular existence on its universal; or the judgment states the agreement or disagreement of these two aspects
- EnL",223
16289,"That is, the predicate is such a term as good, true, correct
- EnL",66
16290,"This is the Assertory judgment
- EnL",36
16291,"Judgments, such as whether an object, action, &c is good, bad, true, beautiful, &c, are those to which even ordinary language first applies the name of judgment
- EnL",166
16293,"On the part of its at first un-mediated subject, the Assertory judgment does not contain the relation of particular with universal which is expressed in the predicate
- EnL",172
16294,"This judgment is consequently a mere subjective particularity, and is confronted by a contrary assertion with equal right, or rather want of right
- EnL",152
16295,"It is therefore at once turned into (2) a Problematical judgment
- EnL",70
16297,"This (the immediate individuality) house (the genus,) being so and so constituted (particularity,) is good or bad
- EnL",119
16298,"This is the Apodictic judgment
- EnL",36
16299,"All things are a genus (ie have a meaning and purpose) in an individual actuality of a particular constitution
- EnL",116
16300,"And they are finite, because the particular in them may and also may not conform to the universal
- EnL",103
16301,"In this manner subject and predicate are each the whole judgment
- EnL",70
16302,"The immediate constitution of the subject is at first exhibited as the intermediating ground, where the individuality of the actual thing meets with its universality, and in this way as the ground of the judgment
- EnL",218
16303,"What has been really made explicit is the oneness of subject and predicate, as the notion itself, filling up the empty 'is' of the copula
- EnL",143
16304,"While its constituent elements are at the same time distinguished as subject and predicate, the notion is put as their unity, as the connexion which serves to intermediate them: in short, as the Syllogism
- EnL",210
16305,"The Syllogism brings the notion and the judgment into one
- EnL",63
16306,"It is notion,--being the simple identity into which the distinctions of form in the judgment have retired
- EnL",111
16307,"It is judgment,--because it is at the same time set in reality, that is, put in the distinction of its terms
- EnL",114
16308,"The Syllogism is the reasonable, and everything reasonable
- EnL",64
16310,"But formal Syllogism really presents what is reasonable in such a reasonless way that it has nothing to do with any reasonable matter
- EnL",139
16311,"But as the matter in question can only be rational in virtue of the same quality by which thought is reason, it can be made so by the form only: and that form is Syllogism
- EnL",177
16312,"And what is a Syllogism but an explicit putting, ie realising of the notion, at first in form only, as stated above?
- EnL",122
16313,"Accordingly the Syllogism is the essential ground of whatever is true: and at the present stage the definition of the Absolute is that it is the Syllogism, or stating the principle in a proposition: Everything is a Syllogism
- EnL",230
16316,"The Syllogism, like the notion and the judgment, is usually described as a form merely of our subjective thinking
- EnL",119
16317,"The Syllogism, it is said, is the process of proving the judgment
- EnL",71
16318,"And certainly the judgment does in every case refer us to the Syllogism
- EnL",77
16319,"The step from the one to the other however is not brought about by our subjective action, but by the judgment itself which puts itself as Syllogism, and in the conclusion returns to the unity of the notion
- EnL",211
16320,"The precise point by which we pass to the Syllogism is found in the Apodictic judgment
- EnL",92
16321,"In it we have an individual which by means of its qualities connects itself with its universal or notion
- EnL",110
16322,"Here we see the particular becoming the mediating mean between the individual and the universal
- EnL",101
16323,"This gives the fundamental form of the Syllogism, the gradual specification of which, formally considered, consists in the fact that universal and individual also occupy this place of mean
- EnL",194
16324,"This again paves the way for the passage from subjectivity to objectivity
- EnL",79
16325,"In the 'immediate' Syllogism the several aspects of the notion confront one another abstractly, and stand in an external relation only
- EnL",140
16326,"In this way the extremes are put as independent and without affinity either towards one another or towards their mean
- EnL",123
16327,"Such a Syllogism contains reason, but in utter notionlessness,--the formal Syllogism of Understanding
- EnL",107
16328,"In it the subject is coupled with an other character; or the universal by this mediation subsumes a subject external to it
- EnL",128
16329,"In the rational Syllogism, on the contrary, the subject is by means of the mediation coupled with itself
- EnL",110
16330,"In this manner it first comes to be a subject: or, in the subject we have the first germ of the rational Syllogism
- EnL",120
16331,"In the following examination, the Syllogism of Understanding, according to the interpretation usually put upon it, is expressed in its subjective shape; the shape which it has when we are said to make such Syllogisms
- EnL",222
16332,"And it really is only a subjective syllogising
- EnL",52
16333,"Such Syllogism however has also an objective meaning; it expresses only the finitude of things, but does so in the specific mode which the form has here reached
- EnL",166
16335,"We might object to the conception on which this depends, and according to which the mind is merely a sum of forces or faculties existing side by side
- EnL",155
16337,"For, in the first place, what the Formal Logic usually examines in its theory of syllogism, is really nothing but the mere syllogism of understanding, which has no claim to the honour of being made a form of rationality, still less to be held as the embodiment of all reason
- EnL",280
16338,"The notion, in the second place, so far from being a form of understanding, owes its degradation to such a place entirely to the influence of that abstract mode of thought
- EnL",177
16339,"And it is not unusual to draw such a distinction between a notion of understanding and a notion of reason
- EnL",111
16340,"The distinction however does not mean that notions are of two kinds
- EnL",73
16341,"It means that our own action often stops short at the mere negative and abstract form of the notion, when we might also have proceeded to apprehend the notion in its true nature, as at once positive and concrete
- EnL",217
16342,"It is eg the mere understanding, which thinks liberty to be the abstract contrary of necessity, whereas the adequate rational notion of liberty requires the element of necessity to be merged in it
- EnL",202
16343,"Similarly the definition of God, given by what is called Deism, is merely the mode in which the understanding thinks God: whereas Christianity, to which He is known as the Trinity, contains the rational notion of God
- EnL",222
16344,"The first syllogism is a syllogism of definite being,--a Qualitative Syllogism, as stated in the last paragraph
- EnL",117
16345,"Its form (1) is I--P--U: ie a subject as Individual is coupled (concluded) with a Universal character by means of a (Particular) quality
- EnL",142
16346,"Of course the subject (terminus minor) has other characteristics besides individuality, just as the other extreme (the predicate of the conclusion, or terminus major) has other characteristics than mere universality
- EnL",221
16347,"But here the interest turns only on the characteristics through which these terms make a syllogism
- EnL",104
16348,"The syllogism of existence is a syllogism of understanding merely, at least in so far as it leaves the individual, the particular, and the universal to confront each other quite abstractly
- EnL",194
16349,"In this syllogism the notion is at the very height of self-estrangement
- EnL",77
16350,"We have in it an immediately individual thing as subject: next some one particular aspect or property attaching to this subject is selected, and by means of this property the individual turns out to be a universal
- EnL",219
16351,"Thus we may say, This rose is red: Red is a colour: Therefore, this rose is a coloured object
- EnL",99
16352,"It is this aspect of the syllogism which the common logics mainly treat of
- EnL",80
16353,"There was a time when the syllogism was regarded as an absolute rule for all cognition, and when a scientific statement was not held to be valid until it had been shown to follow from a process of syllogism
- EnL",212
16354,"At present, on the contrary, the different forms of the syllogism are met nowhere save in the manuals of Logic; and an acquaintance with them is considered a piece of mere pedantry, of no further use either in practical life or in science
- EnL",244
16355,"It would indeed be both useless and pedantic to parade the whole machinery of the formal syllogism on every occasion
- EnL",122
16356,"And yet the several forms of syllogism make themselves constantly felt in our cognition
- EnL",93
16359,"We do not, however, for a moment deny that a study of Logic is no more necessary to teach us how to draw correct conclusions, than a previous study of anatomy and physiology is required in order to digest or breathe
- EnL",221
16360,"Aristotle was the first to observe and describe the different forms, or, as they are called, figures of syllogism, in their subjective meaning: and he performed his work so exactly and surely, that no essential addition has ever been required
- EnL",248
16361,"But while sensible of the value of what he has thus done, we must not forget that the forms of the syllogism of understanding, and of finite thought altogether, are not what Aristotle has made use of in his properly philosophical investigations
- EnL",250
16362,"This syllogism is completely contingent (α) in the matter of its terms
- EnL",76
16364,"Similarly a single particularity may have various characters in itself, so that the same medius terminus would serve to connect the subject with several different universals
- EnL",179
16365,"It is more a caprice of fashion, than a sense of its incorrectness, which has led to the disuse of ceremonious syllogising
- EnL",128
16366,"This and the following section indicate the uselessness of such syllogising for the ends of truth
- EnL",103
16367,"The point of view indicated in the paragraph shows how this style of syllogism can 'demonstrate' (as the phrase goes) the most diverse conclusions
- EnL",152
16368,"All that is requisite is to find a medius terminus from which the transition can be made to the proposition sought
- EnL",120
16369,"Another medius terminus would enable us to demonstrate something else, and even the contrary of the last
- EnL",110
16370,"And the more concrete an object is, the more aspects it has, which may become such middle terms
- EnL",101
16372,"Little as we usually think on the Syllogism of Understanding in the daily business of life, it never ceases to play its part there
- EnL",136
16373,"In a civil suit, for instance, it is the duty of the advocate to give due force to the legal titles which make in favour of his client
- EnL",140
16374,"In logical language, such a legal title is nothing but a middle term
- EnL",74
16375,"Diplomatic transactions afford another illustration of the same, when, for instance, different powers lay claim to one and the same territory
- EnL",147
16376,"In such a case the laws of inheritance, the geographical position of the country, the descent and the language of its inhabitants, or any other ground, may be emphasised as a medius terminus
- EnL",196
16377,"In the syllogism, according to its notion, truth lies in connecting two distinct things by a Middle Term in which they are one
- EnL",132
16378,"But connexions of the extremes with the Middle Term (the so-called premisses, the major and the minor premiss) are in the case of this syllogism much more decidedly immediate connexions
- EnL",191
16379,"In other words, they have not a proper Middle Term
- EnL",56
16380,"This contradiction in the syllogism exhibits a new case of the infinite progression
- EnL",89
16381,"Each of the premisses evidently calls for a fresh syllogism to demonstrate it: and as the new syllogism has two immediate premisses, like its predecessor, the demand for proof is doubled at every step, and repeated without end
- EnL",232
16382,"On account of its importance for experience, there has been here noted a defect in the syllogism, to which in this form absolute correctness had been ascribed
- EnL",164
16383,"This defect however must lose itself in the further specification of the syllogism
- EnL",88
16384,"For we are now within the sphere of the notion; and here therefore, as well as in the judgment, the opposite character is not merely present potentially, but is explicit
- EnL",175
16385,"To work out the gradual specification of the syllogism, therefore, there need only be admitted and accepted what is at each step realised by the syllogism itself
- EnL",167
16386,"Through the immediate syllogism I--P--U, the Individual is mediated (through a Particular) with the Universal, and in this conclusion put as a universal
- EnL",158
16387,"It follows that the individual subject, becoming itself a universal, serves to unite the two extremes, and to form their ground of intermediation
- EnL",151
16388,"This gives the second figure of the syllogism, (2) U--I--P It expresses the truth of the first; it shows in other words that the intermediation has taken place in the individual, and is thus something contingent
- EnL",217
16389,"The universal, which in the first conclusion was specified through individuality, passes over into the second figure and there now occupies the place that belonged to the immediate subject
- EnL",194
16390,"In the second figure it is concluded with the particular
- EnL",62
16391,"By this conclusion therefore the universal is explicitly put as particular--and is now made to mediate between the two extremes, the places of which are occupied by the two others (the particular and the individual)
- EnL",221
16392,"No wonder then that the figures have been in later times treated as an empty piece of formalism
- EnL",101
16394,"And Aristotle would have been the last person to give any countenance to those who wish to attach importance to such inquiries or to the syllogism of understanding in general
- EnL",180
16395,"It is true that he described these, as well as numerous other forms of mind and nature, and that he examined and expounded their specialities
- EnL",147
16396,"But in his metaphysical theories, as well as his theories of nature and mind, he was very far from taking as basis, or criterion, the syllogistic forms of the 'understanding'
- EnL",180
16397,"Indeed it might be maintained that not one of these theories would ever have come into existence, or been allowed to exist, if it had been compelled to submit to the laws of understanding
- EnL",193
16399,"Such, for example, is the case with the three branches of philosophy; the Logical Idea, Nature, and Mind
- EnL",110
16400,"As we first see them, Nature is the middle term which links the others together
- EnL",85
16401,"Nature, the totality immediately before us, unfolds itself into the two extremes of the Logical Idea and Mind
- EnL",115
16402,"But Mind is Mind only when it is mediated through nature
- EnL",62
16403,"Then, in the second place, Mind, which we know as the principle of individuality, or as the actualising principle, is the mean; and Nature and the Logical Idea are the extremes
- EnL",182
16404,"It is Mind which cognises the Logical Idea in Nature and which thus raises Nature to its essence
- EnL",102
16405,"In the third place again the Logical Idea itself becomes the mean: it is the absolute substance both of mind and of nature, the universal and all-pervading principle
- EnL",171
16406,"These are the members of the Absolute Syllogism
- EnL",53
16407,"In the round by which each constituent function assumes successively the place of mean and of the two extremes, their specific difference from each other has been superseded
- EnL",179
16408,"In this form, where there is no distinction between its constituent elements, the syllogism at first has for its connective link equality, or the external identity of understanding
- EnL",186
16409,"This is the Quantitative or Mathematical Syllogism: if two things are equal to a third, they are equal to one another
- EnL",123
16410,"These mathematical axioms however are really nothing but logical propositions, which, so far as they enunciate definite and particular thoughts, are deducible from the universal and self-characterising thought
- EnL",215
16411,"To deduce them, is to give their proof
- EnL",44
16412,"That is true of the Quantitative syllogism, to which mathematics gives the rank of an axiom
- EnL",97
16413,"It is really the proximate result of the qualitative or immediate syllogism
- EnL",81
16414,"Finally, the Quantitative syllogism is the syllogism in utter formlessness
- EnL",80
16415,"The difference between the terms which is required by the notion is suspended
- EnL",83
16416,"Extraneous circumstances alone can decide what propositions are to be premisses here: and therefore in applying this syllogism we make a pre-supposition of what has been elsewhere proved and established
- EnL",208
16417,"Two results follow as to the form
- EnL",39
16419,"In the first figure I--P--U the two premisses I is P and P is U are yet without a mediation
- EnL",97
16420,"The former premiss is mediated in the third, the latter in the second figure
- EnL",82
16421,"But each of these two figures, again, for the mediation of its premisses pre-supposes the two others
- EnL",106
16422,"In consequence of this, the mediating unity of the notion must be put no longer as an abstract particularity, but as a developed unity of the individual and universal--and in the first place a reflected unity of these elements
- EnL",232
16423,"That is to say, the individuality gets at the same time the character of universality
- EnL",91
16424,"A mean of this kind gives the Syllogism of Reflection
- EnL",59
16425,"If the mean, in the first place, be not only an abstract particular character of the subject, but at the same time all the individual concrete subjects which possess that character, but possess it only along with others, (1) we have the Syllogism of Allness
- EnL",263
16426,"The major premiss, however, which has for its subject the particular character, the terminus medius, as allness, pre-supposes the very conclusion which ought rather to have pre-supposed it
- EnL",194
16427,"It rests therefore (2) on an Induction, in which the mean is given by the complete list of individuals as such,--a, b, c, d, &c On account of the disparity, however, between universality and an immediate and empirical individuality, the list can never be complete
- EnL",269
16428,"Induction therefore rests upon (3) Analogy
- EnL",48
16429,"The middle term of Analogy is an individual, which however is understood as equivalent to its essential universality, its genus, or essential character--The first syllogism for its intermediation turns us over to the second, and the second turns us over to the third
- EnL",272
16430,"But the third no less demands an intrinsically determinate Universality, or an individuality as type of the genus, after the round of the forms of external connexion between individuality and universality has been run through in the figures of the Reflective Syllogism
- EnL",274
16431,"By the Syllogism of Allness the defect in the first form of the Syllogism of Understanding, noted in § 184, is remedied, but only to give rise to a new defect
- EnL",164
16432,"This defect is that the major premiss itself pre-supposes what really ought to be the conclusion, and pre-supposes it as what is thus an 'immediate' proposition
- EnL",166
16433,"All men are mortal, therefore Caius is mortal: All metals conduct electricity, therefore eg copper does so
- EnL",112
16435,"Everybody feels not merely the pedantry, but the unmeaning formalism of such syllogisms as: All men are mortal, Caius is a man, therefore Caius is mortal
- EnL",159
16436,"The syllogism of Allness hands us over to the syllogism of Induction, in which the individuals form the coupling mean
- EnL",123
16437,"We thus get the syllogism of Induction I in the following shape P--I--U I 
- EnL",80
16438,"Gold is a metal: silver is a metal: so is copper, lead, &c This is the major premiss
- EnL",90
16439,"Then comes the minor premiss: All these bodies conduct electricity; and hence results the conclusion, that all metals conduct electricity
- EnL",143
16440,"The point which brings about a combination here is individuality in the shape of allness
- EnL",94
16441,"But this syllogism once more hands us over to another syllogism
- EnL",69
16442,"Its mean is constituted by the complete list of the individuals
- EnL",69
16443,"That pre-supposes that over a certain region observation and experience are completed
- EnL",91
16444,"But the things in question here are individuals; and so again we are landed in the progression ad infinitum (i, i, i, &c)
- EnL",127
16445,"In other words, in no Induction can we ever exhaust the individuals
- EnL",73
16446,"The 'all metals,' 'all plants,' of our statements, mean only all the metals, all the plants, which we have hitherto become acquainted with
- EnL",144
16447,"Every Induction is consequently imperfect
- EnL",47
16448,"One and the other observation, many it may be, have been made: but all the cases, all the individuals, have not been observed
- EnL",131
16449,"By this defect of Induction we are led on to Analogy
- EnL",58
16450,"In the syllogism of Analogy we conclude from the fact that some things of a certain kind possess a certain quality, that the same quality is possessed by other things of the same kind
- EnL",189
16451,"It would be a syllogism of Analogy, for example, if we said: In all planets hitherto discovered this has been found to be the law of motion, consequently a newly discovered planet will probably move according to the same law
- EnL",230
16452,"In the experiential sciences Analogy deservedly occupies a high place, and has led to results of the highest importance
- EnL",125
16453,"Analogy is the instinct of reason, creating an anticipation that this or that characteristic, which experience has discovered, has its root in the inner nature or kind of an object, and arguing on the faith of that anticipation
- EnL",233
16454,"Analogy it should be added may be superficial or it may be thorough
- EnL",73
16455,"It would certainly be a very bad analogy to argue that since the man Caius is a scholar, and Titus also is a man, Titus will probably be a scholar too: and it would be bad because a man's learning is not an unconditional consequence of his manhood
- EnL",253
16456,"Superficial analogies of this kind however are very frequently met with
- EnL",77
16457,"It is often argued, for example: The earth is a celestial body, so is the moon, and it is therefore in all probability inhabited as well as the earth
- EnL",155
16458,"The analogy is not one whit better than that previously mentioned
- EnL",71
16460,"What has in modern times been called the Philosophy of Nature consists principally in a frivolous play with empty and external analogies, which, however, claim to be considered profound results
- EnL",199
16461,"The natural consequence has been to discredit the philosophical study of nature
- EnL",85
16462,"The Syllogism of Necessity, if we look to its purely abstract characteristics or terms, has for its mean the Universal in the same way as the Syllogism of Reflection has the Individual, the latter being in the second, and the former in the third figure (§ 187)
- EnL",266
16463,"The Universal is expressly put as in its very nature intrinsically determinate
- EnL",84
16464,"In the first place (1) the Particular, meaning by the particular the specific genus or species, is the term for mediating the extremes--as is done in the Categorical syllogism
- EnL",181
16465,"It is one and the same universal which is in these terms of the Disjunctive syllogism; they are only different forms for expressing it
- EnL",140
16466,"The syllogism has been taken conformably to the distinctions which it contains; and the general result of the course of their evolution has been to show that these differences work out their own abolition and destroy the notion's outwardness to its own self
- EnL",263
16467,"And, as we see, in the first place, (1) each of the dynamic elements has proved itself the systematic whole of these elements, in short a whole syllogism,--they are consequently implicitly identical
- EnL",204
16468,"In the second place, (2) the negation of their distinctions and of the mediation of one through another constitutes independency; so that it is one and the same universal which is in these forms, and which is in this way also explicitly put as their identity
- EnL",264
16470,"It is followed by the second part, the doctrine of Method, which proposes to show how a body of scientific knowledge is created by applying to existing objects the forms of thought discussed in the elementary part
- EnL",219
16471,"It believes thought to be a mere subjective and formal activity, and the objective fact, which confronts thought, to have a separate and permanent being
- EnL",158
16472,"But this dualism is a half-truth: and there is a want of intelligence in the procedure which at once accepts, without inquiring into their origin, the categories of subjectivity and objectivity
- EnL",199
16473,"Both of them, subjectivity as well as objectivity, are certainly thoughts--even specific thoughts: which must show themselves founded on the universal and self-determining thought
- EnL",185
16474,"This has here been done--at least for subjectivity
- EnL",56
16475,"We have recognised it, or the notion subjective (which includes the notion proper, the judgment, and the syllogism) as the dialectical result of the first two main stages of the Logical Idea, Being and Essence
- EnL",215
16476,"To say that the notion is subjective and subjective only, is so far quite correct: for the notion certainly is subjectivity itself
- EnL",136
16477,"Not less subjective than the notion are also the judgment and syllogism: and these forms, together with the so-called Laws of Thought (the Laws of Identity, Difference, and Sufficient Ground), make up the contents of what is called the 'Elements' in the common logic
- EnL",272
16478,"But we may go a step further
- EnL",34
16479,"This subjectivity, with its functions of notion, judgment, and syllogism, is not like a set of empty compartments which has to get filled from without by separately-existing objects
- EnL",187
16480,"It would be truer to say that it is subjectivity itself which, as dialectical, breaks through its own barriers and opens out into objectivity by means of the syllogism
- EnL",173
16482,"I his transition from the Subject, the notion in general, and especially the syllogism, to the Object, may, at the first glance, appear strange, particularly if we look only at the Syllogism of Understanding, and suppose syllogising to be only an act of consciousness
- EnL",273
16483,"But that strangeness imposes on us no obligation to seek to make the transition plausible to the image-loving conception
- EnL",126
16484,"The only question which can be considered is, whether our usual conception of what is called an 'object' approximately corresponds to the object as here described
- EnL",168
16485,"By 'object' is commonly understood not an abstract being, or an existing thing merely, or any sort of actuality, but something independent, concrete, and self-complete, this completeness being the totality of the notion
- EnL",225
16486,"That the object (Objekt) is also an object to us (Gegenstand) and is external to something else, will be more precisely seen, when it puts itself in contrast with the subjective
- EnL",183
16487,"At present, as that into which the notion has passed from its mediation, it is only immediate object and nothing more, just as the notion is not describable as subjective, previous to the subsequent contrast with objectivity
- EnL",230
16488,"Further, the Object in general is the one total, in itself still unspecified, the Objective World as a whole, God, the Absolute Object
- EnL",140
16489,"The object, however, has also difference attaching to it: it falls into pieces, indefinite in their multiplicity (making an objective world); and each of these individualised parts is also an object, an intrinsically concrete, complete, and independent existence
- EnL",268
16490,"Objectivity has been compared with being, existence, and actuality; and so too the transition to existence and actuality (not to being, for it is the primary and quite abstract immediate) maybe compared with the transition to objectivity
- EnL",243
16491,"The ground from which existence proceeds, and the reflective correlation which is merged in actuality, are nothing but the as yet imperfectly realised notion
- EnL",163
16492,"They are only abstract aspects of it,--the ground being its merely essence-bred unity, and the correlation only the connexion of real sides which are supposed to have only self-reflected being
- EnL",198
16493,"The notion is the unity of the two; and the object is not a merely essence-like, but inherently universal unity, not only containing real distinctions, but containing them as totalities in itself
- EnL",201
16494,"It is evident that in all these transitions there is a further purpose than merely to show the indissoluble connexion between the notion or thought and being
- EnL",163
16495,"It has been more than once remarked that being is nothing more than simple self-relation, and this meagre category is certainly implied in the notion, or even in thought
- EnL",175
16496,"But the meaning of these transitions is not to accept characteristics or categories, as only implied;--a fault which mars even the Ontological argument for God's existence, when it is stated that being is one among realities
- EnL",230
16498,"But it is equally correct to say that they are different
- EnL",62
16499,"In short, the two modes of expression are equally correct and incorrect
- EnL",77
16500,"The true state of the case can be presented in no expressions of this kind
- EnL",80
16501,"The 'implicit' is an abstraction, still more partial and inadequate than the notion itself, of which the inadequacy is upon the whole suspended, by suspending itself to the object with its opposite inadequacy
- EnL",214
16502,"Hence that implicitness also must, by its negation, give itself the character of explicitness
- EnL",99
16503,"As in every case, speculative identity is not the above-mentioned triviality of an implicit identity of subject and object
- EnL",128
16504,"This has been said often enough
- EnL",37
16505,"Yet it could not be too often repeated, if the intention were really to put an end to the stale and purely malicious misconception in regard to this identity:--of which however there can be no reasonable expectation
- EnL",221
16506,"Looking at that unity in a quite general way, and raising no objection to the one-sided form of its implicitness, we find it as the well-known pre-supposition of the ontological proof for the existence of God
- EnL",214
16507,"There, it appears as supreme perfection
- EnL",45
16508,"Anselm, in whom the notable suggestion of this proof first occurs, no doubt originally restricted himself to the question whether a certain content was in our thinking only
- EnL",178
16509,"His words are briefly these: 'Certe id quo majus cogitari nequit, non potest esse in intellectu solo
- EnL",106
16510,"Si enim vel in solo intellectu est, potest cogitari esse et in re: quod majus est
- EnL",87
16511,"Si ergo id quo majus cogitari non potest, est in solo intellectu; id ipsum quo majus cogitari non potest, est quo majus cogitari potest
- EnL",141
16512,"Sed certe hoc esse non potest'
- EnL",36
16513,"For even if it is in the intellect alone, it can also be thought to exist in fact: and that is greater
- EnL",108
16514,"If then that, than which nothing greater can be thought, is in the intellect alone; then the very thing, which is greater than anything which can be thought, can be exceeded in thought
- EnL",190
16515,"But certainly this is impossible)
- EnL",39
16516,"The same unity received a more objective expression in Descartes, Spinoza and others: while the theory of immediate certitude or faith presents it, on the contrary, in somewhat the same subjective aspect as Anselm
- EnL",219
16517,"These Intuitionalists hold that in our consciousness the attribute of being is indissolubly associated with the conception of God
- EnL",135
16519,"It would be utterly absurd, however, to suppose that the association in consciousness between existence and our conception of finite things is of the same description as the association between existence and the conception of God
- EnL",235
16520,"To do so would be to forget that finite things are changeable and transient, ie that existence is associated with them for a season, but that the association is neither eternal nor inseparable
- EnL",198
16521,"Speaking in the phraseology of the categories before us, we may say that, to call a thing finite, means that its objective existence is not in harmony with the thought of it, with its universal calling, its kind and its end
- EnL",229
16522,"Anselm, consequently, neglecting any such conjunction as occurs in finite things, has with good reason pronounced that only to be the Perfect which exists not merely in a subjective, but also in an objective mode
- EnL",218
16523,"It does no good to put on airs against the Ontological proof, as it is called, and against Anselm thus denning the Perfect
- EnL",128
16524,"The argument is one latent in every unsophisticated mind, and it recurs in every philosophy, even against its wish and without its knowledge--as may be seen in the theory of immediate belief
- EnL",196
16525,"The real fault in the argumentation of Anselm is one which is chargeable on Descartes and Spinoza, as well as on the theory of immediate knowledge
- EnL",152
16526,"This unity which is enunciated as the supreme perfection or, it may be, subjectively, as the true knowledge, is pre-supposed, ie it is assumed only as potential
- EnL",166
16527,"This identity, abstract as it thus appears, between the two categories may be at once met and opposed by their diversity; and this was the very answer given to Anselm long ago
- EnL",181
16528,"In short, the conception and existence of the finite is set in antagonism to the infinite; for, as previously remarked, the finite possesses objectivity of such a kind as is at once incongruous with and different from the end or aim, its essence and notion
- EnL",262
16529,"Or, the finite is such a conception and in such a way subjective, that it does not involve existence
- EnL",106
16530,"This objection and this antithesis are got over, only by showing the finite to be untrue and these categories in their separation to be inadequate and null
- EnL",161
16531,"Their identity is thus seen to be one into which they spontaneously pass over, and in which they are reconciled
- EnL",117
16532,"The Object is immediate being, because insensible to difference, which in it has suspended itself
- EnL",103
16533,"It is, further, a totality in itself, whilst at the same time (as this identity is only the implicit identity of its dynamic elements) it is equally indifferent to its immediate unity
- EnL",189
16534,"It thus breaks up into distinct parts, each of which is itself the totality
- EnL",81
16535,"Hence the object is the absolute contradiction between a complete independence of the multiplicity, and the equally complete non-independence of the different pieces
- EnL",171
16536,"The definition, which states that the Absolute is the Object, is most definitely implied in the Leibnizian Monad
- EnL",118
16537,"The Monads are each an object, but an object implicitly 'representative,' indeed the total representation of the world
- EnL",124
16538,"In the simple unity of the Monad, all difference is merely ideal, not independent or real
- EnL",95
16539,"Nothing from without comes into the monad: It is the whole notion in itself, only distinguished by its own greater or less development
- EnL",140
16540,"None the less, this simple totality parts into the absolute multeity of differences, each becoming an independent monad
- EnL",125
16541,"In the monad of monads, and the Pre-established Harmony of their inward developments, these substances are in like manner again reduced to 'ideality' and unsubstantiality
- EnL",176
16542,"The philosophy of Leibnitz, therefore, represents contradiction in its complete development
- EnL",97
16543,"No doubt God is the Object, and, indeed, the Object out and out, confronted with which our particular or subjective opinions and desires have no truth and no validity
- EnL",172
16544,"As absolute object however, God does not therefore take up the position of a dark and hostile power over against subjectivity
- EnL",131
16545,"He rather involves it as a vital element in Himself
- EnL",57
16546,"Such also is the meaning of the Christian doctrine, according to which God has willed that all men should be saved and all attain blessedness
- EnL",147
16548,"But God in the Christian religion is also known as Love, because in His Son, who is one with Him, He has revealed Himself to men as a man amongst men, and thereby redeemed them
- EnL",182
16550,"Just as religion and religious worship consist in overcoming the antithesis of subjectivity and objectivity, so science too and philosophy have no other task than to overcome this antithesis by the medium of thought
- EnL",221
16551,"The aim of knowledge is to divest the objective world that stands opposed to us of its strangeness, and, as the phrase is, to find ourselves at home in it: which means no more than to trace the objective world back to the notion,--to our innermost self
- EnL",258
16552,"The two are wholly dialectical
- EnL",36
16553,"The notion is at first only subjective: but without the assistance of any foreign material or stuff it proceeds, in obedience to its own action, to objectify itself
- EnL",170
16554,"So, too, the object is not rigid and processless
- EnL",54
16555,"Its process is to show itself as what is at the same time subjective, and thus form the step onwards to the idea
- EnL",118
16557,"The object of mechanical type is the immediate and undifferentiated object
- EnL",80
16558,"No doubt it contains difference, but the different pieces stand, as it were, without affinity to each other, and their connexion is only extraneous
- EnL",153
16559,"In chemism, on the contrary, the object exhibits an essential tendency to differentiation, in such a way that the objects are what they are only by their relation to each other: this tendency to difference constitutes their quality
- EnL",237
16560,"The third type of objectivity, the teleological relation, is the unity of mechanism and chemism
- EnL",101
16561,"Design, like the mechanical object, is a self-contained totality, enriched however by the principle of differentiation which came to the fore in chemism, and thus referring itself to the object that stands over against it
- EnL",227
16562,"Finally, it is the realisation of design which forms the transition to the Idea
- EnL",85
16563,"The object (1) in its immediacy is the notion only potentially; the notion as subjective is primarily outside it; and all its specific character is imposed from without
- EnL",174
16564,"As a unity of differents, therefore, it is a composite, an aggregate; and its capacity of acting on anything else continues to be an external relation
- EnL",156
16565,"This is Formal Mechanism--Notwithstanding, and in this connexion and non-independence, the objects remain independent and offer resistance, external to each other
- EnL",168
16566,"Pressure and impact are examples of mechanical relations
- EnL",62
16567,"Our knowledge is said to be mechanical or by rote, when the words have no meaning for us, but continue external to sense, conception, thought; and when, being similarly external to each other, they form a meaningless sequence
- EnL",231
16568,"Conduct, piety, &c are in the same way mechanical, when a man's behaviour is settled for him by ceremonial laws, by a spiritual adviser, &c; in short, when his own mind and will are not in his actions, which in this way are extraneous to himself
- EnL",251
16569,"It is also the category beyond which reflection seldom goes
- EnL",65
16570,"It is, however, a shallow and superficial mode of observation, one that cannot carry us through in connexion with Nature and still less in connexion with the world of Mind
- EnL",177
16571,"In Nature it is only the veriest abstract relations of matter in its inert masses which obey the law of mechanism
- EnL",119
16573,"Still less satisfactory is it to transfer these categories and apply them in the field of organic nature; at least if it be our aim to understand the specific features of that field, such as the growth and nourishment of plants, or, it may be, even animal sensation
- EnL",271
16575,"But even in considering the formations in the world of Mind, the mechanical theory has been repeatedly invested with an authority which it has no right to
- EnL",160
16576,"Take as an instance the remark that man consists of soul and body
- EnL",71
16577,"In this language, the two things stand each self-subsistent, and associated only from without
- EnL",99
16578,"Similarly we find the soul regarded as a mere group of forces and faculties, subsisting independently side by side
- EnL",120
16579,"Thus decidedly must we reject the mechanical mode of inquiry when it comes forward and arrogates to itself the place of rational cognition in general, and seeks to get mechanism accepted as an absolute category
- EnL",216
16580,"But we must not on that account forget expressly to vindicate for mechanism the right and import of a general logical category
- EnL",132
16581,"It would be, therefore, a mistake to restrict it to the special physical department from which it derives its name
- EnL",120
16582,"There is no harm done, for example, in directing attention to mechanical actions, such as that of gravity, the lever, &c, even in departments, notably in physics and in physiology, beyond the range of mechanics proper
- EnL",223
16583,"It must however be remembered, that within these spheres the laws of mechanism cease to be final or decisive, and sink, as it were, to a subservient position
- EnL",163
16584,"To which may be added, that, in Nature, when the higher or organic functions are in any way checked or disturbed in their normal efficiency, the otherwise subordinate category of mechanism is immediately seen to take the upper hand
- EnL",237
16585,"Thus a sufferer from indigestion feels pressure on the stomach, after partaking of certain food in slight quantity; whereas those whose digestive organs are sound remain free from the sensation, although they have eaten as much
- EnL",233
16586,"The same phenomenon occurs in the general feeling of heaviness in the limbs, experienced in bodily indisposition
- EnL",118
16587,"Even in the world of Mind, mechanism has its place; though there, too, it is a subordinate one
- EnL",100
16588,"It would betray bad psychology, however, to have recourse to mechanism for an explanation of the nature of memory, and to apply mechanical laws straight off to the soul
- EnL",174
16589,"The mechanical feature in memory lies merely in the fact that certain signs, tones, &c are apprehended in their purely external association, and then reproduced in this association, without attention being expressly directed to their meaning and inward association
- EnL",270
16590,"To become acquainted with these conditions of mechanical memory requires no further study of mechanics, nor would that study tend at all to advance the special inquiry of psychology
- EnL",187
16591,"The want of stability in itself which allows the object to suffer violence, is possessed by it (see preceding §) only in so far as it has a certain stability
- EnL",163
16592,"Now as the object is implicitly invested with the character of notion, the one of these characteristics is not merged into its other; but the object, through the negation of itself (its lack of independence), closes with itself, and not till it so closes, is it independent
- EnL",279
16593,"Thus at the same time in distinction from the outwardness, and negativing that outwardness in its independence, does this independence form a negative unity with self,--Centrality (subjectivity)
- EnL",200
16594,"So conceived, the object itself has direction and reference towards the external
- EnL",86
16595,"But this external object is similarly central in itself, and being so, is no less only referred towards the other centre; so that it no less has its centrality in the other
- EnL",178
16596,"This is (2) Mechanism with Affinity (with bias, or 'difference'), and may be illustrated by gravitation, appetite, social instinct, &c  197
- EnL",145
16597,"This relationship, when fully carried out, forms a syllogism
- EnL",66
16598,"In that syllogism the immanent negativity, as the central individuality of an object, (abstract centre,) relates itself to non-independent objects, as the other extreme, by a mean which unites the centrality with the non-independence of the objects, (relative centre)
- EnL",273
16599,"This is (3) Absolute Mechanism
- EnL",36
16600,"The syllogism thus indicated (I--P--U) is a triad of syllogisms
- EnL",69
16601,"The wrong individuality of non-independent objects, in which formal Mechanism is at home, is, by reason of that non-independence, no less universality, though it be only external
- EnL",184
16602,"Hence these objects also form the mean between the absolute and the relative centre (the form of syllogism being U--I--P): for it is by this want of independence that those two are kept asunder and made extremes, as well as related to one another
- EnL",252
16604,"It does so no less essentially as a disintegrating force, in its character of immanent individuality, than in virtue of universality, acting as an identical bond of union and tranquil self-containedness
- EnL",208
16605,"Like the solar system, so for example in the practical sphere the state is a system of three syllogisms
- EnL",109
16607,"The immediacy of existence, which the objects have in Absolute Mechanism, is implicitly negatived by the fact that their independence is derived from, and due to, their connexions with each other, and therefore to their own want of stability
- EnL",247
16608,"Thus the object must be explicitly stated as in its existence having an Affinity (or a bias) towards its other,--as not-indifferent
- EnL",137
16609,"The not-indifferent (biassed) object has an immanent mode which constitutes its nature, and in which it has existence
- EnL",123
16610,"But as it is invested with the character of total notion, it is the contradiction between this totality and the special mode of its existence
- EnL",147
16611,"Consequently it is the constant endeavour to cancel this contradiction and to make its definite being equal to the notion
- EnL",127
16612,"The common name of mechanical relationship is applied to both, in contra-distinction to the teleological
- EnL",110
16613,"There is a reason for this in the common feature which belongs to mechanism and chemism
- EnL",93
16614,"In them the notion exists, but only implicit and latent, and they are thus both marked off from teleology where the notion has real independent existence
- EnL",159
16615,"This is true: and yet chemism and mechanism are very decidedly distinct
- EnL",77
16616,"The object, in the form of mechanism, is primarily only an indifferent reference to self, while the chemical object is seen to be completely in reference to something else
- EnL",177
16618,"In nature, for example; the several celestial bodies, which form our solar system, compose a kinetic system, and thereby show that they are related to one another
- EnL",168
16619,"Motion, however, as the unity of time and space, is a connexion which is purely abstract and external
- EnL",107
16620,"And it seems therefore as if these celestial bodies, which are thus externally connected with each other, would continue to be what they are, even apart from this reciprocal relation
- EnL",188
16621,"The case is quite different with chemism
- EnL",46
16622,"Objects chemically biassed are what they are expressly by that bias alone
- EnL",79
16623,"Hence they are the absolute impulse towards integration by and in one another
- EnL",83
16624,"The product of the chemical process consequently is the Neutral object, latent in the two extremes, each on the alert
- EnL",123
16625,"The notion or concrete universal, by means of the bias of the objects (the particularity), coalesces with the individuality (in the shape of the product), and in that only with itself
- EnL",189
16626,"In this process too the other syllogisms are equally involved
- EnL",67
16627,"The place of mean is taken both by individuality as activity, and by the concrete universal, the essence of the strained extremes; which essence reaches definite being in the product
- EnL",188
16628,"Chemism, as it is a reflectional nexus of objectivity, has pre-supposed, not merely the bias or non-indifferent nature of the objects, but also their immediate independence
- EnL",178
16629,"The process of chemism consists in passing to and fro from one form to another; which forms continue to be as external as before--In the neutral product the specific properties, which the extremes bore towards each other, are merged
- EnL",238
16630,"But although the product is conformable to the notion, the inspiring principle of active differentiation does not exist in it; for it has sunk back to immediacy
- EnL",166
16631,"The neutral body is therefore capable of disintegration
- EnL",61
16633,"The notion as notion is only the heart and core of the process, and does not in this stage come to an existence of its own
- EnL",128
16634,"In the neutral product the process is extinct, and the existing cause falls outside it
- EnL",92
16635,"Each of these two processes, the reduction of the biassed (not-indifferent) to the neutral, and the differentiation of the indifferent or neutral, goes its own way without hindrance from the other
- EnL",202
16636,"But that want of inner connexion shows that they are finite, by their passage into products in which they are merged and lost
- EnL",131
16638,"In these circumstances it is the End (Final Cause)
- EnL",56
16639,"The result thus attained is the liberation of the notion, which in chemism and mechanism was present only in the germ, and not yet evolved
- EnL",144
16640,"The notion in the shape of the aim or end thus comes into independent existence
- EnL",85
16641,"In the End the notion has entered on free existence and has a being of its own, by means of the negation of immediate objectivity
- EnL",135
16642,"It is characterised as subjective, seeing that this negation is, in the first place, abstract, and hence at first the relation between it and objectivity still one of contrast
- EnL",181
16643,"This character of subjectivity, however, compared with the totality of the notion, is one-sided, and that, be it added, for the End itself, in which all specific characters have been put as subordinated and merged
- EnL",219
16644,"For it therefore even the object, which it pre-supposes, has only hypothetical (ideal) reality,--essentially no-reality
- EnL",125
16645,"The End in short is a contradiction of its self-identity against the negation stated in it, ie its antithesis to objectivity, and being so, contains the eliminative or destructive activity which negates the antithesis and renders it identical with itself
- EnL",260
16646,"This is the realisation of the End: in which, while it turns itself into the other of its subjectivity and objectifies itself, thus cancelling the distinction between the two, it has only closed with itself, and retained itself
- EnL",233
16647,"The notion of Design or End, while on one hand called redundant, is on another justly described as the rational notion, and contrasted with the abstract universal of understanding
- EnL",185
16648,"The latter only subsumes the particular, and so connects it with itself: but has it not in its own nature--The distinction between the End or final cause, and the mere efficient cause (which is the cause ordinarily so called), is of supreme importance
- EnL",257
16649,"Causes, properly so called, belong to the sphere of necessity, blind, and not yet laid bare
- EnL",97
16650,"The cause therefore appears as passing into its correlative, and losing its primordiality there by sinking into dependency
- EnL",128
16651,"It is only by implication, or for us, that the cause is in the effect made for the first time a cause, and that it there returns into itself
- EnL",146
16652,"The End, on the other hand, is expressly stated as containing the specific character in its own self,--the effect, namely, which in the purely causal relation is never free from otherness
- EnL",193
16653,"The End therefore in its efficiency does not pass over, but retains itself, ie it carries into effect itself only, and is at the end what it was in the beginning or primordial state
- EnL",187
16655,"By End however we must not at once, nor must we ever merely, think of the form which it has in consciousness as a mode of mere mental representation
- EnL",154
16656,"By means of the notion of Inner Design Kant has resuscitated the Idea in general and particularly the idea of life
- EnL",120
16657,"Aristotle's definition of life virtually implies inner design, and is thus far in advance of the notion of design in modern Teleology, which had in view finite and outward design only
- EnL",189
16658,"Animal wants and appetites are some of the readiest instances of the End
- EnL",78
16659,"They are the felt contradiction, which exists within the living subject, and pass into the activity of negating this negation which mere subjectivity still is
- EnL",164
16660,"The satisfaction of the want or appetite restores the peace between subject and object
- EnL",92
16661,"The objective thing which, so long as the contradiction exists, ie so long as the want is felt, stands on the other side, loses this quasi-independence, by its union with the subject
- EnL",188
16662,"Those who talk of the permanence and immutability of the finite, as well subjective as objective, may see the reverse illustrated in the operations of every appetite
- EnL",171
16663,"Appetite is, so to speak, the conviction that the subjective is only a half-truth, no more adequate than the objective
- EnL",124
16664,"But appetite in the second place carries out its conviction
- EnL",65
16665,"It brings about the supersession of these finites: it cancels the antithesis between the objective which would be and stay an objective only, and the subjective which in like manner would be and stay a subjective only
- EnL",223
16666,"As regards the action of the End, attention may be called to the fact, that in the syllogism, which represents that action, and shows the end closing with itself by the means of realisation, the radical feature is the negation of the termini
- EnL",247
16667,"That negation is the one just mentioned both of the immediate subjectivity appearing in the End as such, and of the immediate objectivity as seen in the means and the objects pre-supposed
- EnL",193
16668,"This is the same negation, as is in operation when the mind leaves the contingent things of the world as well as its own subjectivity and rises to God
- EnL",156
16669,"It is the 'moment' or factor which (as noticed in the Introduction and § 192) was overlooked and neglected in the analytic form of syllogisms, under which the so-called proofs of the Being of a God presented this elevation
- EnL",228
16670,"In its primary and immediate aspect the Teleological relation is external design, and the notion confronts a pre-supposed object
- EnL",134
16671,"The End is consequently finite, and that partly in its content, partly in the circumstance that it has an external condition in the object, which has to be found existing, and which is taken as material for its realisation
- EnL",228
16672,"Its self-determining is to that extent in form only
- EnL",57
16673,"The un-mediatedness of the End has the further result that its particularity or content--which as form-characteristic is the subjectivity of the End--is reflected into self, and so different from the totality of the form, subjectivity in general, the notion
- EnL",263
16674,"This variety constitutes the finitude of Design within its own nature
- EnL",75
16675,"The content of the End
- EnL",28
16676,"In accordance with this view of it, things are supposed not to carry their vocation in themselves, but merely to be means employed and spent in realising a purpose which lies outside of them
- EnL",196
16677,"That may be said to be the point of view taken by Utility, which once played a great part even in the sciences, but of late has fallen into merited disrepute, now that people have begun to see that it failed to give a genuine insight into the nature of things
- EnL",265
16678,"It is true that finite things as finite ought in justice to be viewed as non-ultimate, and as pointing beyond themselves
- EnL",126
16679,"This negativity of finite things however is their own dialectic, and in order to ascertain it we must pay attention to their positive content
- EnL",147
16680,"Teleological observations on things often proceed from a well-meant wish to display the wisdom of God as it is especially revealed in nature
- EnL",146
16682,"It is easy to see that they promoted the genuine interest neither of religion nor of science
- EnL",98
16683,"External design stands immediately in front of the idea: but what thus stands on the threshold often for that reason is least adequate
- EnL",140
16684,"The teleological relation is a syllogism in which the subjective end coalesces with the objectivity external to it, through a middle term which is the unity of both
- EnL",170
16685,"This unity is on one hand the purposive action, on the other the Means, ie objectivity made directly subservient to purpose
- EnL",129
16686,"First of all we have the Subjective End; and that, as the notion in independent being, is itself the totality of the elementary functions of the notion
- EnL",157
16687,"The first of these functions is that of self-identical universality, as it were the neutral first water, in which everything is involved, but nothing as yet discriminated
- EnL",176
16688,"The second of these elements is the particularising of this universal, by which it acquires a specific content
- EnL",116
16689,"As this specific content again is realised by the agency of the universal, the latter returns by its means back to itself, and coalesces with itself
- EnL",154
16690,"Hence too when we set some end before us, we say that we 'conclude' to do something: a phrase which implies that we were, so to speak, open and accessible to this or that determination
- EnL",190
16691,"Similarly we also at a further step speak of a man 'resolving' to do something, meaning that the agent steps forward out of his self-regarding inwardness and enters into dealings with the environing objectivity
- EnL",216
16692,"This supplies the step from the merely Subjective End to the purposive action which tends outwards
- EnL",104
16693,"The universal notion is brought to unite with individuality by means of particularity, so that the individual as self-determination acts as judge
- EnL",151
16695,"It throws itself in the first place immediately upon the object, which it appropriates to itself as a Means
- EnL",113
16697,"In finite teleology the Means is thus broken up into two elements external to each other, (a) the action and (b) the object which serves as Means
- EnL",151
16698,"The relation of the final cause as power to this object, and the subjugation of the object to it, is immediate (it forms the first premiss in the syllogism) to this extent, that in the teleological notion as the self-existent ideality the object is put as potentially null
- EnL",278
16699,"This relation, as represented in the first premiss, itself becomes the Means, which at the same time involves the syllogism, that through this relation--in which the action of the End is contained and dominant--the End is coupled with objectivity
- EnL",252
16701,"The human soul has much to do, before it makes its corporeal nature into a means
- EnL",86
16702,"Man must, as it were, take possession of his body, so that it may be the instrument of his soul
- EnL",101
16703,"The Means in its capacity of object stands, in this second premiss, in direct relation to the other extreme of the syllogism, namely, the material or objectivity which is pre-supposed
- EnL",189
16704,"This relation is the sphere of chemism and mechanism, which have now become the servants of the Final Cause, where lies their truth and free notion
- EnL",153
16705,"Thus the Subjective End, which is the power ruling these processes, in which the objective things wear themselves out on one another, contrives to keep itself free from them, and to preserve itself in them
- EnL",211
16706,"Doing so, it appears as the Cunning of reason
- EnL",51
16707,"Cunning may be said to lie in the inter-mediative action which, while it permits the objects to follow their own bent and act upon one another till they waste away, and does not itself directly interfere in the process, is nevertheless only working out its own aims
- EnL",271
16708,"With this explanation, Divine Providence may be said to stand to the world and its process in the capacity of absolute cunning
- EnL",132
16709,"God lets men do as they please with their particular passions and interests; but the result is the accomplishment of--not their plans, but His, and these differ decidedly from the ends primarily sought by those whom He employs
- EnL",232
16710,"The realised End is thus the overt unity of subjective and objective
- EnL",74
16712,"The End maintains itself against and in the objective for it is no mere one-sided subjective or particular, it is also the concrete universal, the implicit identity of both
- EnL",178
16713,"This universal, as simply reflected in itself, is the content which remains unchanged through all the three termini of the syllogism and their movement
- EnL",157
16714,"In finite design, however, even the executed End has the same radical rift or flaw as had the Means and the initial End
- EnL",125
16715,"We have got therefore only a form extraneously impressed on a pre-existing material: and this form, by reason of the limited content of the End, is also a contingent characteristic
- EnL",186
16716,"The End achieved consequently is only an object, which again becomes a Means or material for other Ends, and so on for ever
- EnL",129
16717,"But what virtually happens in the realising of the End is that the one-sided subjectivity and the show of objective independence confronting it are both cancelled
- EnL",168
16718,"In laying hold of the means, the notion constitutes itself the very implicit essence of the object
- EnL",104
16719,"In the mechanical and chemical processes the independence of the object has been already dissipated implicitly, and in the course of their movement under the dominion of the End, the show of that independence, the negative which confronts the notion, is got rid of
- EnL",270
16720,"But in the fact that the End achieved is characterised only as a Means and a material, this object, viz the teleological, is there and then put as implicitly null, and only 'ideal'
- EnL",186
16721,"This being so, the antithesis between form and content has also vanished
- EnL",78
16722,"While the End by the removal and absorption of all form-characteristics coalesces with itself, the form as self-identical is thereby put as the content, so that the notion, which is the action of form, has only itself for content
- EnL",235
16723,"Through this process, therefore, there is made explicitly manifest what was the notion of design: viz the implicit unity of subjective and objective is now realised
- EnL",170
16724,"And this is the Idea
- EnL",26
16725,"But, as a matter of fact, the object is the notion implicitly: and thus when the notion, in the shape of End, is realised in the object, we have but the manifestation of the inner nature of the object itself
- EnL",213
16726,"Objectivity is thus, as it were, only a covering under which the notion lies concealed
- EnL",92
16727,"Within the range of the finite we can never see or experience that the End has been really secured
- EnL",104
16728,"The consummation of the infinite End, therefore, consists merely in removing the illusion which makes it seem yet unaccomplished
- EnL",134
16729,"The Good, the absolutely Good, is eternally accomplishing itself in the world: and the result is that it needs not wait upon us, but is already by implication, as well as in full actuality, accomplished
- EnL",208
16730,"This is the illusion under which we live
- EnL",46
16731,"It alone supplies at the same time the actualising force on which the interest in the world reposes
- EnL",105
16732,"In the course of its process the Idea creates that illusion, by setting an antithesis to confront it; and its action consists in getting rid of the illusion which it has created
- EnL",183
16733,"Only out of this error does the truth arise
- EnL",49
16734,"In this fact lies the reconciliation with error and with finitude
- EnL",71
16735,"Error or other-being, when superseded, is still a necessary dynamic element of truth: for truth can only be where it makes itself its own result
- EnL",150
16736,"The Idea is truth in itself and for itself,--the absolute unity of the notion and objectivity
- EnL",99
16738,"The definition, which declares the Absolute to be the Idea, is itself absolute
- EnL",84
16739,"All former definitions come back to this
- EnL",46
16740,"The Idea is the Truth: for Truth is the correspondence of objectivity with the notion:--not of course the correspondence of external things with my conceptions,--for these are only correct conceptions held by me, the individual person
- EnL",240
16741,"In the idea we have nothing to do with the individual, nor with figurate conceptions, nor with external things
- EnL",116
16742,"And yet, again, everything actual, in so far as it is true, is the Idea, and has its truth by and in virtue of the Idea alone
- EnL",131
16743,"Every individual being is some one aspect of the Idea: for which, therefore, yet other actualities are needed, which in their turn appear to have a self-subsistence of their own
- EnL",183
16744,"It is only in them altogether and in their relation that the notion is realised
- EnL",85
16745,"The individual by itself does not correspond to its notion
- EnL",64
16746,"It is this limitation of its existence which constitutes the finitude and the ruin of the individual
- EnL",106
16747,"The Idea itself is not to be taken as an idea of something or other, any more than the notion is to be taken as merely a specific notion
- EnL",142
16748,"The Absolute is the universal and one idea, which, by an act of 'judgment,' particularises itself to the system of specific ideas; which after all are constrained by their nature to come back to the one idea where their truth lies
- EnL",236
16749,"As issued out of this 'judgment' the Idea is in the first place only the one universal substance: but its developed and genuine actuality is to be as a subject and in that way as mind
- EnL",189
16750,"Because it has no existence for starting-point and point d'appui, the Idea is frequently treated as a mere logical form
- EnL",125
16751,"Such a view must be abandoned to those theories, which ascribe so-called reality and genuine actuality to the existent thing and all the other categories which have not yet penetrated as far as the Idea
- EnL",208
16752,"It is no less false to imagine the Idea to be mere abstraction
- EnL",68
16753,"It is abstract certainly, in so far as everything untrue is consumed in it: but in its own self it is essentially concrete, because it is the free notion giving character to itself, and that character, reality
- EnL",215
16754,"It would be an abstract form, only if the notion, which is its principle, were taken as an abstract unity, and not as the negative return of it into self and as the subjectivity which it really is
- EnL",202
16755,"This is truth, however, only in reference to consciousness; it is formal truth, bare correctness
- EnL",102
16756,"Truth in the deeper sense consists in the identity between objectivity and the notion
- EnL",91
16757,"It is in this deeper sense of truth that we speak of a true state, or of a true work of art
- EnL",97
16758,"These objects are true, if they are as they ought to be, ie if their reality corresponds to their notion
- EnL",110
16759,"When thus viewed, to be untrue means much the same as to be bad
- EnL",69
16760,"A bad man is an untrue man, a man who does not behave as his notion or his vocation requires
- EnL",98
16761,"Nothing however can subsist, if it be wholly devoid of identity between the notion and reality
- EnL",100
16762,"Even bad and untrue things have being, in so far as their reality still, somehow, conforms to their notion
- EnL",112
16763,"Whatever is thoroughly bad or contrary to the notion, is for that very reason on the way to ruin
- EnL",102
16764,"It is by the notion alone that the things in the world have their subsistence; or, as it is expressed in the language of religious conception, things are what they are, only in virtue of the divine and thereby creative thought which dwells within them
- EnL",257
16765,"The idea is rather what is completely present: and it is found, however confused and degenerated, in every consciousness
- EnL",126
16766,"We conceive the world to ourselves as a great totality which is created by God, and so created that in it God has manifested Himself to us
- EnL",144
16768,"The proof of that is contained in the whole deduction and development of thought up to this point
- EnL",103
16769,"The idea is the result of this course of dialectic
- EnL",56
16770,"Not that it is to be supposed that the idea is mediate only, ie mediated through something else than itself
- EnL",113
16771,"It is rather its own result, and being so, is no less immediate than mediate
- EnL",82
16772,"The stages hitherto considered, viz those of Being and Essence, as well as those of Notion and of Objectivity, are not, when so distinguished, something permanent, resting upon themselves
- EnL",193
16773,"They have proved to be dialectical; and their only truth is that they are dynamic elements of the idea
- EnL",108
16774,"The Idea may be described in many ways
- EnL",44
16776,"It is easy work for the understanding to show that everything said of the Idea is self-contradictory
- EnL",106
16777,"But that can quite as well be retaliated, or rather in the Idea the retaliation is actually made
- EnL",102
16778,"And this work, which is the work of reason, is certainly not so easy as that of the understanding
- EnL",103
16780,"The reverse of all this however is the doctrine of Logic
- EnL",62
16781,"Logic shows that the subjective which is to be subjective only, the finite which would be finite only, the infinite which would be infinite only, and so on, have no truth, but contradict themselves, and pass over into their opposites
- EnL",239
16782,"Hence this transition, and the unity in which the extremes are merged and become factors, each with a merely reflected existence, reveals itself as their truth
- EnL",165
16783,"The understanding, which addresses itself to deal with the Idea, commits a double misunderstanding
- EnL",104
16784,"It takes first the extremes of the Idea (be they expressed as they will, so long as they are in their unity), not as they are understood when stamped with this concrete unity, but as if they remained abstractions outside of it
- EnL",232
16785,"It no less mistakes the relation between them, ever when it has been expressly stated
- EnL",91
16786,"Thus, for example it overlooks even the nature of the copula in the judgment, which affirms that the individual, or subject, is after all not individual, but universal
- EnL",173
16787,"But, in the second place, the understanding believes its 'reflection,'--that the self-identical Idea contains its own negative, or contains contradiction,--to be an external reflection which does not lie within the Idea itself
- EnL",232
16788,"But the reflection is really no peculiar cleverness of the understanding
- EnL",78
16789,"The Idea itself is the dialectic which for ever divides and distinguishes the self-identical from the differentiated, the subjective from the objective, the finite from the infinite, soul from body
- EnL",203
16790,"Only on these terms is it an eternal creation, eternal vitality, and eternal spirit
- EnL",89
16791,"But while it thus passes or rather translates itself into the abstract understanding, it for ever remains reason
- EnL",118
16792,"The Idea is the dialectic which again makes this mass of understanding and diversity understand its finite nature and the pseudo-independence in its productions, and which brings the diversity back to unity
- EnL",212
16794,"The different modes of apprehending the Idea as unity of ideal and real, of finite and infinite, of identity and difference, &c are more or less formal
- EnL",157
16795,"They designate some one stage of the specific notion
- EnL",58
16797,"The Idea is the infinite judgment, of which the terms are severally the independent totality; and in which, as each grows to the fulness of its own nature, it has thereby at the same time passed into the other
- EnL",215
16798,"None of the other specific notions exhibits this totality complete on both its sides as the notion itself and objectivity
- EnL",127
16799,"The Idea is essentially a process, because its identity is the absolute and free identity of the notion, only in so far as it is absolute negativity and for that reason dialectical
- EnL",186
16801,"As the idea is (a) a process, it follows that such an expression for the Absolute as unity of thought and being, of finite and infinite, &c is false; for unity expresses an abstract and merely quiescent identity
- EnL",217
16802,"As the Idea is (b) subjectivity, it follows that the expression is equally false on another account
- EnL",105
16803,"That unity of which it speaks expresses a merely virtual or underlying presence of the genuine unity
- EnL",106
16804,"The infinite would thus seem to be merely neutralised by the finite, the subjective by the objective, thought by being
- EnL",124
16805,"But in the negative unity of the Idea, the infinite overlaps and includes the finite, thought overlaps being, subjectivity overlaps objectivity
- EnL",149
16807,"The first form of the idea is Life: that is, the idea in the form of immediacy
- EnL",84
16808,"The second form is that of mediation or differentiation; and this is the idea in the form of Knowledge, which appears under the double aspect of the Theoretical and Practical idea
- EnL",185
16809,"The process of knowledge eventuates in the restoration of the unity enriched by difference
- EnL",96
16810,"This gives the third form of the idea, the Absolute Idea: which last stage of the logical idea evinces itself to be at the same time the true first, and to have a being due to itself alone
- EnL",194
16811,"The immediate idea is Life
- EnL",32
16812,"As soul, the notion is realised in a body of whose externality the soul is the immediate self-relating universality
- EnL",121
16813,"But the soul is also its particularisation, so that the body expresses no other distinctions than follow from the characterisations of its notion
- EnL",151
16815,"Thus as life is the initial particularisation, so it results in the negative self-asserting unity: in the dialectic of its corporeity it only coalesces with itself
- EnL",169
16816,"In this way life is essentially something alive, and in point of its immediacy this individual living thing
- EnL",113
16817,"It is characteristic of finitude in this sphere that, by reason of the immediacy of the idea, body and soul are separable
- EnL",127
16818,"This constitutes the mortality of the living being
- EnL",56
16819,"It is only, however, when the living being is dead, that these two sides of the idea are different ingredients
- EnL",116
16820,"A hand eg when hewn off from the body is, as Aristotle has observed, a hand in name only, not in fact
- EnL",107
16821,"From the point of view of understanding, life is usually spoken of as a mystery, and in general as incomprehensible
- EnL",121
16822,"By giving it such a name, however, the Understanding only confesses its own finitude and nullity
- EnL",102
16823,"So far is life from being incomprehensible, that in it the very notion is presented to us, or rather the immediate idea existing as a notion
- EnL",146
16824,"And having said this, we have indicated the defect of life
- EnL",64
16825,"Its notion and reality do not thoroughly correspond to each other
- EnL",71
16826,"The notion of life is the soul, and this notion has the body for its reality
- EnL",82
16827,"The soul is, as it were, infused into its corporeity; and in that way it is at first sentient only, and not yet freely self-conscious
- EnL",139
16828,"The process of life consists in getting the better of the immediacy with which it is still beset: and this process, which is itself threefold, results in the idea under the form of judgment, ie the idea as Cognition
- EnL",221
16829,"A living being is a syllogism, of which the very elements are in themselves systems and syllogisms (§§ 198, 201, 207)
- EnL",123
16830,"They are however active syllogisms or processes; and in the subjective unity of the vital agent make only one process
- EnL",123
16831,"Thus the living being is the process of its coalescence with itself, which runs on through three processes
- EnL",112
16832,"In that process it makes a split on its own self, and reduces its corporeity to its object or its inorganic nature
- EnL",120
16833,"This corporeity, as an aggregate of correlations, enters in its very nature into difference and opposition of its elements, which mutually become each other's prey, and assimilate one another, and are retained by producing themselves
- EnL",239
16834,"Yet this action of the several members (organs), is only the living subject's one act to which their productions revert; so that in these productions nothing is produced except the subject: in other words, the subject only reproduces itself
- EnL",246
16835,"As Sensibility, the living being is immediately simple self-relation--it is the soul omnipresent in its body, the outsideness of each member of which to others has for it no truth
- EnL",185
16836,"As Irritability, the living being appears split up in itself; and as Reproduction, it is perpetually restoring itself from the inner distinction of its members and organs
- EnL",176
16837,"A vital agent only exists as this continually self-renewing process within its own limits
- EnL",95
16838,"As this negative of the animate is no less a function in the notion of the animate itself, it exists consequently in the latter (which is at the same time a concrete universal) in the shape of a defect or want
- EnL",215
16839,"The dialectic by which the object, being implicitly null, is merged, is the action of the self-assured living thing, which in this process against an inorganic nature thus retains, develops, and objectifies itself
- EnL",219
16840,"The result of the assimilation is not, as in the chemical process, a neutral product in which the independence of the two confronting sides is merged; but the living being shows itself as large enough to embrace its other which cannot withstand its power
- EnL",260
16841,"The inorganic nature which is subdued by the vital agent suffers this fate, because it is virtually the same as what life is actually
- EnL",139
16842,"Thus in the other the living being only coalesces with itself
- EnL",67
16843,"But when the soul has fled from the body, the elementary powers of objectivity begin their play
- EnL",101
16844,"These powers are, as it were, continually on the spring, ready to begin their process in the organic body; and life is the constant battle against them
- EnL",157
16845,"It is now therefore implicitly a Kind, with essential universality of nature
- EnL",82
16846,"The particularising of this Kind is the relation of the living subject to another subject of its Kind: and the judgment is the tie of Kind over these individuals thus appointed for each other
- EnL",197
16847,"This is the Affinity of the Sexes
- EnL",39
16848,"The process of Kind brings it to a being of its own
- EnL",57
16849,"Life being no more than the idea immediate, the product of this process breaks up into two sides
- EnL",102
16850,"On the one hand, the living individual, which was at first pre-supposed as immediate, is now seen to be mediated and generated
- EnL",132
16851,"On the other, however, the living individuality, which, on account of its first immediacy, stands in a negative attitude towards universality, sinks in the superior power of the latter
- EnL",190
16852,"Implicitly it is the universal or Kind, and yet immediately it exists as an individual only
- EnL",97
16853,"Death shows the Kind to be the power that rules the immediate individual
- EnL",78
16854,"For the animal the process of Kind is the highest point of its vitality
- EnL",77
16855,"But the animal never gets so far in its Kind as to have a being of its own; it succumbs to the power of Kind
- EnL",114
16856,"In the process of Kind the immediate living being mediates itself with itself, and thus rises above its immediacy, only however to sink back into it again
- EnL",160
16857,"Life thus runs away, in the first instance, only into the false infinity of the progress ad infinitum
- EnL",107
16858,"The real result, however, of the process of life, in the point of its notion, is to merge and overcome that immediacy with which the idea, in the shape of life, is still beset
- EnL",181
16859,"In this manner however the idea of life has thrown off not some one particular and immediate 'This,' but this first immediacy as a whole
- EnL",142
16860,"It thus comes to itself, to its truth: it enters upon existence as a free Kind self-subsistent
- EnL",100
16861,"The death of merely immediate and individual vitality is the 'procession' of spirit
- EnL",89
16862,"The idea exists free for itself, in so far as it has universality for the medium of its existence,--as objectivity itself has notional being,--as the idea is its own object
- EnL",178
16863,"Its subjectivity, thus universalised, is pure self-contained distinguishing of the idea,--intuition which keeps itself in this identical universality
- EnL",155
16864,"But, as specific distinguishing, it is the further judgment of repelling itself as a totality from itself, and thus, in the first place, pre-supposing itself as an external universe
- EnL",187
16865,"There are two judgments, which though implicitly identical are not yet explicitly put as identical
- EnL",104
16866,"The relation of these two ideas, which implicitly and as life are identical, is thus one of correlation: and it is that correlativity which constitutes the characteristic of finitude in this sphere
- EnL",203
16867,"It is the relationship of reflection, seeing that the distinguishing of the idea in its own self is only the first judgment--presupposing the other and not yet supposing itself to constitute it
- EnL",199
16868,"And thus for the subjective idea the objective is the immediate world found ready to hand, or the idea as life is in the phenomenon of individual existence
- EnL",161
16869,"At the same time, in so far as this judgment is pure distinguishing within its own limits (§ 223), the idea realises in one both itself and its other
- EnL",155
16871,"This process is in general terms Cognition
- EnL",48
16872,"In Cognition in a single act the contrast is virtually superseded, as regards both the one-sidedness of subjectivity and the one-sidedness of objectivity
- EnL",159
16873,"At first, however, the supersession of the contrast is but implicit
- EnL",73
16874,"The process as such is in consequence immediately infected with the finitude of this sphere, and splits into the twofold movement of the instinct of reason, presented as two different movements
- EnL",199
16876,"On the other hand, it supersedes the one-sidedness of the objective world, which is now, on the contrary, estimated as only a mere semblance, a collection of contingencies and shapes at bottom visionary
- EnL",208
16877,"It modifies and informs that world by the inward nature of the subjective, which is here taken to be the genuine objective
- EnL",128
16878,"The former is the instinct of science after Truth, Cognition properly so called:--the Theoretical action of the idea
- EnL",122
16879,"The latter is the instinct of the Good to fulfil the same--the Practical activity of the idea or Volition
- EnL",111
16880,"The universal finitude of Cognition, which lies in the one judgment, the pre-supposition of the contrast (§ 224),--a pre-supposition in contradiction of which its own act lodges protest, specialises itself more precisely on the face of its own idea
- EnL",254
16881,"The result of that specialisation is, that its two elements receive the aspect of being diverse from each other, and, as they are at least complete, they take up the relation of 'reflection,' not of 'notion,' to one another
- EnL",229
16882,"The assimilation of the matter, therefore, as a datum, presents itself in the light of a reception of it into categories which at the same time remain external to it, and which meet each other in the same style of diversity
- EnL",229
16883,"Reason is active here, but it is reason in the shape of understanding
- EnL",75
16884,"The truth which such Cognition can reach will therefore be only finite: the infinite truth (of the notion) is isolated and made transcendent, an inaccessible goal in a world of its own
- EnL",190
16885,"Still in its external action cognition stands under the guidance of the notion, and notional principles form the secret clue to its movement
- EnL",146
16886,"The conception is one attributed to Aristotle; but no man is further than Aristotle from such an outside theory of Cognition
- EnL",130
16887,"Such a style of Cognition does not recognise in itself the activity of the notion--an activity which it is implicitly, but not consciously
- EnL",144
16888,"In its own estimation its procedure is passive
- EnL",52
16889,"Really that procedure is active
- EnL",37
16891,"Its activity therefore consists in analysing the given concrete object, isolating its differences, and giving them the form of abstract universality
- EnL",154
16892,"Or it leaves the concrete thing as a ground, and by setting aside the unessential-looking particulars, brings into relief a concrete universal, the Genus, or Force and Law
- EnL",177
16893,"This is the Analytical Method
- EnL",35
16894,"This is far from the case
- EnL",31
16895,"It depends on the form of the objects of our investigation, which of the two methods, that are derivable from the notion of finite cognition, ought to be applied
- EnL",167
16896,"In the first place, cognition is analytical
- EnL",49
16897,"Analytical cognition deals with an object which is presented in detachment, and the aim of its action is to trace back to a universal the individual object before it
- EnL",171
16898,"Thought in such circumstances means no more than an act of abstraction or of formal identity
- EnL",98
16899,"That is the sense in which thought is understood by Locke and all empiricists
- EnL",83
16900,"Cognition, it is often said, can never do more than separate the given concrete objects into their abstract elements, and then consider these elements in their isolation
- EnL",175
16901,"It is, however, at once apparent that this turns things upside down, and that cognition, if its purpose be to take things as they are, thereby falls into contradiction with itself
- EnL",185
16902,"Thus the chemist eg places a piece of flesh in his retort, tortures it in many ways, and then informs us that it consists of nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, &c True: but these abstract matters have ceased to be flesh
- EnL",218
16903,"The same defect occurs in the reasoning of an empirical psychologist when he analyses an action into the various aspects which it presents, and then sticks to these aspects in their separation
- EnL",198
16904,"The object which is subjected to analysis is treated as a sort of onion from which one coat is peeled off after another
- EnL",125
16905,"This universality is (2) also a specific universality
- EnL",59
16906,"In this case the line of activity follows the three 'moments' of the notion, which (as it has not its infinity in finite cognition) is the specific or definite notion of understanding
- EnL",189
16907,"The reception of the object into the forms of this notion is the Synthetic Method
- EnL",87
16908,"The latter starts from the individual, and proceeds to the universal; in the former the starting-point is given by the universal (as a definition), from which we proceed by particularising (in division) to the individual (the theorem)
- EnL",240
16909,"The Synthetic method thus presents itself as the development of the 'moments' of the notion on the object
- EnL",111
16910,"The materials and the proof of Definition are procured by means of the Analytical method (§ 227)
- EnL",102
16911,"The specific character however is expected to be a 'mark' only: that is to say it is to be in behoof only of the purely subjective cognition which is external to the object
- EnL",178
16912,"The general answer to this question is to say, that definitions originate by way of analysis
- EnL",98
16913,"This will explain how it happens that people quarrel about the correctness of proposed definitions; for here everything depends on what perceptions we started from, and what points of view we had before our eyes in so doing
- EnL",229
16914,"The richer the object to be defined is, that is, the more numerous are the aspects which it offers to our notice, the more various are the definitions we may frame of it
- EnL",175
16915,"Thus there are quite a host of definitions of life, of the state, &c Geometry, on the contrary, dealing with a theme so abstract as space, has an easy task in giving definitions
- EnL",183
16916,"Again, in respect of the matter or contents of the objects defined, there is no constraining necessity present
- EnL",116
16917,"We are expected to admit that space exists, that there are plants, animals, &c, nor is it the business of geometry, botany, &c to demonstrate that the objects in question necessarily are
- EnL",192
16918,"This very circumstance makes the synthetical method of cognition as little suitable for philosophy as the analytical: for philosophy has above all things to leave no doubt of the necessity of its objects
- EnL",209
16919,"And yet several attempts have been made to introduce the synthetical method into philosophy
- EnL",97
16920,"Thus Spinoza, in particular, begins with definitions
- EnL",58
16921,"He says, for instance, that substance is the causa sui
- EnL",60
16922,"His definitions are unquestionably a storehouse of the most speculative truth, but it takes the shape of dogmatic assertions
- EnL",130
16923,"The same thing is also true of Schelling
- EnL",46
16924,"That requires a principle or ground of division so constituted, that the division based upon it embraces the whole extent of the region designated by the definition in general
- EnL",181
16925,"But, in division, there is the further requirement that the principle of it must be borrowed from the nature of the object in question
- EnL",140
16926,"If this condition be satisfied, the division is natural and not merely artificial, that is to say, arbitrary
- EnL",114
16927,"Thus, in zoology, the ground of division adopted in the classification of the mammalia is mainly afforded by their teeth and claws
- EnL",136
16928,"That is so far sensible, as the mammals themselves distinguish themselves from one another by these parts of their bodies; back to which therefore the general type of their various classes is to be traced
- EnL",210
16929,"In every case the genuine division must be controlled by the notion
- EnL",73
16930,"To that extent a division, in the first instance, has three members: but as particularity exhibits itself as double, the division may go to the extent even of four members
- EnL",177
16931,"In the sphere of mind trichotomy is predominant, a circumstance which Kant has the credit of bringing into notice
- EnL",119
16932,"It is a Theorem
- EnL",21
16933,"Being different, these characteristics possess but a mediated identity
- EnL",76
16934,"To supply the materials, which form the middle terms, is the office of Construction: and the process of mediation itself, from which cognition derives the necessity of that nexus, is the Demonstration
- EnL",206
16935,"As the difference between the analytical and synthetical methods is commonly stated, it seems entirely optional which of the two we employ
- EnL",144
16936,"If we assume, to start with, the concrete thing which the synthetic method presents as a result, we can analyse from it as consequences the abstract propositions which formed the pre-suppositions and the material for the proof
- EnL",232
16937,"Thus, algebraical definitions of curved lines are theorems in the method of geometry
- EnL",90
16938,"Similarly even the Pythagorean theorem, if made the definition of a right-angled triangle, might yield to analysis those propositions which geometry had already demonstrated on its behoof
- EnL",193
16939,"The optionalness of either method is due to both alike starting from an external pre-supposition
- EnL",102
16940,"So far as the nature of the notion is concerned, analysis is prior; since it has to raise the given material with its empirical concreteness into the form of general abstractions, which may then be set in the front of the synthetical method as definitions
- EnL",261
16941,"That these methods, however indispensable and brilliantly successful in their own province, are unserviceable for philosophical cognition, is self-evident
- EnL",160
16942,"They have pre-suppositions; and their style of cognition is that of understanding, proceeding under the canon of formal identity
- EnL",134
16943,"In Spinoza, who was especially addicted to the use of the geometrical method, we are at once struck by its characteristic formalism
- EnL",137
16944,"Yet his ideas were speculative in spirit; whereas the system of Wolf, who carried the method out to the height of pedantry, was even in subject-matter a metaphysic of the understanding
- EnL",190
16945,"The abuses which these methods with their formalism once led to in philosophy and science have in modern times been followed by the abuses of what is called 'Construction'
- EnL",177
16946,"Kant brought into vogue the phrase that mathematics 'construes' its notions
- EnL",81
16947,"All that was meant by the phrase was that mathematics has not to do with notions, but with abstract qualities of sense-perceptions
- EnL",136
16949,"In the background of all this, certainly, there is a dim consciousness of the Idea, of the unity of the notion and objectivity,--a consciousness, too, that the idea is concrete
- EnL",182
16950,"But that play of what is styled 'construing' is far from presenting this unity adequately--a unity which is none other than the notion properly so called: and the sensuous concreteness of perception is as little the concreteness of reason and the idea
- EnL",257
16951,"Another point calls for notice
- EnL",36
16952,"Geometry works with the sensuous but abstract perception of space; and in space it experiences no difficulty in isolating and defining certain simple analytic modes
- EnL",170
16953,"To geometry alone therefore belongs in its perfection the synthetical method of finite cognition
- EnL",102
16954,"In its course, however (and this is the remarkable point), it finally stumbles upon what are termed irrational and incommensurable quantities; and in their case any attempt at further specification drives it beyond the principle of the understanding
- EnL",255
16955,"This is only one of many instances in terminology, where the title rational is perversely applied to the province of understanding, while we stigmatise as irrational that which shows a beginning and a trace of rationality
- EnL",227
16956,"Other sciences, removed as they are from the simplicity of space or number, often and necessarily reach a point where understanding permits no further advance: but they get over the difficulty without trouble
- EnL",214
16957,"They make a break in the strict sequence of their procedure, and assume whatever they require, though it be the reverse of what preceded, from some external quarter,--opinion, perception, conception or any other source
- EnL",224
16958,"Its inobservancy as to the nature of its methods and their relativity to the subject-matter prevents this finite cognition from seeing that, when it proceeds by definitions and divisions, &c, it is really led on by the necessity of the laws of the notion
- EnL",260
16959,"For the same reason it cannot see when it has reached its limit; nor, if it have transgressed that limit, does it perceive that it is in a sphere where the categories of understanding, which it still continues rudely to apply, have lost all authority
- EnL",256
16960,"The necessity, which finite cognition produces in the Demonstration, is, in the first place, an external necessity, intended for the subjective intelligence alone
- EnL",168
16961,"But in necessity as such, cognition itself has left behind its presupposition and starting-point, which consisted in accepting its content as given or found
- EnL",162
16962,"Necessity quâ necessity is implicitly the self-relating notion
- EnL",68
16963,"The subjective idea has thus implicitly reached an original and objective determinateness,--a something not-given, and for that reason immanent in the subject
- EnL",164
16964,"It has passed over into the idea of Will
- EnL",46
16965,"In its starting-point cognition had a given and a contingent content; but now, at the close of its movement, it knows its content to be necessary
- EnL",151
16966,"This necessity is reached by means of subjective agency
- EnL",61
16967,"Similarly, subjectivity at starting was quite abstract, a bare tabula rasa
- EnL",80
16968,"It now shows itself as a modifying and determining principle
- EnL",66
16969,"In this way we pass from the idea of cognition to that of will
- EnL",68
16970,"The passage, as will be apparent on a closer examination, means that the universal, to be truly apprehended, must be apprehended as subjectivity, as a notion self-moving, active, and form-imposing
- EnL",202
16971,"The subjective idea as original and objective determinateness, and as a simple uniform content, is the Good
- EnL",113
16974,"This contradiction presents itself to imagination as an endless progress in the actualising of the Good; which is therefore set up and fixed as a mere 'ought,' or goal of perfection
- EnL",187
16977,"It is here that we meet those contradictions which are so bewildering from the standpoint of abstract morality
- EnL",116
16978,"This position in its 'practical' bearings is the one taken by the philosophy of Kant, and even by that of Fichte
- EnL",118
16979,"If the world then were as it ought to be, the action of Will would be at an end
- EnL",85
16980,"The Will itself therefore requires that its End should not be realised
- EnL",76
16981,"In these words, a correct expression is given to the finitude of Will
- EnL",75
16982,"But finitude was not meant to be the ultimate point: and it is the process of Will itself which abolishes finitude and the contradiction it involves
- EnL",154
16983,"The reconciliation is achieved, when Will in its result returns to the pre-supposition made by cognition
- EnL",110
16984,"In other words, it consists in the unity of the theoretical and practical idea
- EnL",84
16985,"This is the right attitude of rational cognition
- EnL",54
16986,"Nullity and transitoriness constitute only the superficial features and not the real essence of the world
- EnL",111
16987,"That essence is the notion in posse and in esse: and thus the world is itself the idea
- EnL",92
16988,"All unsatisfied endeavour ceases, when we recognise that the final purpose of the world is accomplished no less than ever accomplishing itself
- EnL",148
16989,"Generally speaking, this is the man's way of looking; while the young imagine that the world is utterly sunk in wickedness, and that the first thing needful is a thorough transformation
- EnL",191
16990,"The religious mind, on the contrary, views the world as ruled by Divine Providence, and therefore correspondent with what it ought to be
- EnL",142
16991,"But this harmony between the 'is' and the 'ought to be' is not torpid and rigidly stationary
- EnL",98
16992,"Good, the final end of the world, has being, only while it constantly produces itself
- EnL",91
16993,"And the world of spirit and the world of nature continue to have this distinction, that the latter moves only in a recurring cycle, while the former certainly also makes progress
- EnL",184
16995,"This life which has returned to itself from the bias and finitude of cognition, and which by the activity of the notion has become identical with it, is the Speculative or Absolute Idea
- EnL",191
16996,"The Idea, as unity of the Subjective and Objective Idea, is the notion of the Idea,--a notion whose object (Gegenstand) is the Idea as such, and for which the objective (Objekt) is Idea,--an Object which embraces all characteristics in its unity
- EnL",251
16997,"This unity is consequently I the absolute and all truth, the Idea which thinks itself,--and here at least as a thinking or Logical Idea
- EnL",141
16998,"In cognition we had the idea in a biassed, one-sided shape
- EnL",64
16999,"The process of cognition has issued in the overthrow of this bias and the restoration of that unity, which as unity, and in its immediacy, is in the first instance the Idea of Life
- EnL",186
17000,"The defect of life lies in its being only the idea implicit or natural: whereas cognition is in an equally one-sided way the merely conscious idea, or the idea for itself
- EnL",176
17001,"The unity and truth of these two is the Absolute Idea, which is both in itself and for itself
- EnL",99
17002,"Hitherto we have had the idea in development through its various grades as our object, but now the idea comes to be its own object
- EnL",136
17003,"This is the νόησις νοήσεως which Aristotle long ago termed the supreme form of the idea
- EnL",93
17004,"Seeing that there is in it no transition, or presupposition, and in general no specific character other than what is fluid and transparent, the Absolute Idea is for itself the pure form of the notion, which contemplates its content as its own self
- EnL",253
17005,"It is its own content, in so far as it ideally distinguishes itself from itself, and the one of the two things distinguished is a self-identity in which however is contained the totality of the form as the system of terms describing its content
- EnL",250
17006,"This content is the system of Logic
- EnL",41
17007,"All that is at this stage left as form for the idea is the Method of this content,--the specific consciousness of the value and currency of the 'moments' in its development
- EnL",178
17008,"It is certainly possible to indulge in a vast amount of senseless declamation about the idea absolute
- EnL",107
17009,"But its true content is only the whole system of which we have been hitherto studying the development
- EnL",107
17011,"The absolute idea may in this respect be compared to the old man who utters the same creed as the child, but for whom it is pregnant with the significance of a lifetime
- EnL",174
17012,"Even if the child understands the truths of religion, he cannot but imagine them to be something outside of which lies the whole of life and the whole of the world
- EnL",169
17013,"The same may be said to be the case with human life as a whole and the occurrences with which it is fraught
- EnL",113
17014,"All work is directed only to the aim or end; and when it is attained, people are surprised to find nothing else but just the very thing which they had wished for
- EnL",167
17015,"The interest lies in the whole movement
- EnL",45
17016,"When a man traces up the steps of his life, the end may appear to him very restricted: but in it the whole decursus vitae is comprehended
- EnL",143
17017,"So, too, the content of the absolute idea is the whole breadth of ground which has passed under our view up to this point
- EnL",127
17018,"Last of all comes the discovery that the whole evolution is what constitutes the content and the interest
- EnL",111
17019,"It is indeed the prerogative of the philosopher to see that everything, which, taken apart, is narrow and restricted, receives its value by its connexion with the whole, and by forming an organic element of the idea
- EnL",221
17020,"Thus it is that we have had the content already, and what we have now is the knowledge that the content is the living development of the idea
- EnL",147
17021,"This simple retrospect is contained in the form of the idea
- EnL",65
17022,"Each of the stages hitherto reviewed is an image of the absolute, but at first in a limited mode, and thus it is forced onwards to the whole, the evolution of which is what we termed Method
- EnL",195
17023,"The several steps or stages of the Speculative Method are, first of all, (a) the Beginning, which is Being or Immediacy: self-subsistent, for the simple reason that it is the beginning
- EnL",190
17024,"But looked at from the speculative idea, Being is its self-specialising act, which as the absolute negativity or movement of the notion makes a judgment and puts itself as its own negative
- EnL",194
17025,"Being, which to the beginning as beginning seems mere abstract affirmation, is thus rather negation, dependency, derivation, and pre-supposition
- EnL",150
17026,"But it is the notion, of which Being is the negation: and the notion is completely self-identical in its otherness, and is the certainty of itself
- EnL",152
17027,"Being therefore is the notion implicit, before it has been explicitly put as a notion
- EnL",91
17028,"This Being therefore, as the still unspecified notion,--a notion that is only implicitly or 'immediately' specified--is equally describable as the Universal
- EnL",162
17029,"When it means universality, it is the beginning of the synthetic method
- EnL",77
17030,"But since the Logical Idea is as much a universal as it is in being--since it is pre-supposed by the notion as much as it itself immediately is, its beginning is a synthetical as well as an analytical beginning
- EnL",216
17031,"In every one of its movements therefore it displays an attitude at once analytical and synthetical
- EnL",104
17032,"Philosophical thought proceeds analytically, in so far as it only accepts its object, the Idea, and while allowing it its own way, is only, as it were, an on-looker at its movement and development
- EnL",202
17033,"To this extent philosophising is wholly passive
- EnL",53
17034,"Philosophic thought however is equally synthetic, and evinces itself to be the action of the notion itself
- EnL",112
17035,"To that end, however, there is required an effort to keep back the incessant impertinence of our own fancies and private opinions
- EnL",135
17036,"The immediate universal, as the notion implicit, is the dialectical force which on its own part deposes its immediacy and universality to the level of a mere stage or 'moment'
- EnL",181
17037,"Thus is put the negative of the beginning, its specific character: it supposes a correlative, a relation of different terms,--the stage of Reflection
- EnL",155
17038,"Seeing that the immanent dialectic only states explicitly what was involved in the immediate notion, this advance is Analytical; but seeing that in this notion this distinction was not yet stated,--it is equally Synthetical
- EnL",229
17039,"It is seen to be mediated and derivative, and neither to have proper being nor proper immediacy
- EnL",101
17040,"It is only for the consciousness which is itself immediate, that Nature forms the commencement or immediacy, and that Spirit appears as what is mediated by Nature
- EnL",168
17041,"The truth is that Nature is the creation of Spirit, and it is Spirit itself which gives itself a pre-supposition in Nature
- EnL",128
17043,"In the second sphere the primarily implicit notion has come as far as shining, and thus is already the idea in germ
- EnL",121
17044,"The development of this sphere becomes a regress into the first, just as the development of the first is a transition into the second
- EnL",139
17045,"It is only by means of this double movement, that the difference first gets its due, when each of the two members distinguished, observed on its own part, completes itself to the totality, and in this way works out its unity with the other
- EnL",245
17046,"It is only by both merging their one-sidedness on their own part, that their unity is kept from becoming one-sided
- EnL",120
17047,"The second sphere developes the relation of the differents to what it primarily is,--to the contradiction in its own nature
- EnL",129
17048,"That contradiction which is seen in the infinite progress is resolved (c) into the end or terminus, where the differenced is explicitly stated as what it is in notion
- EnL",172
17049,"The end is the negative of the first, and as the identity with that, is the negativity of itself
- EnL",102
17050,"It is consequently the unity in which both of these Firsts, the immediate and the real First, are made constituent stages in thought, merged, and at the same time preserved in the unity
- EnL",191
17051,"The notion, which from its implicitness thus comes by means of its differentiation and the merging of that differentiation to close with itself, is the realised notion,--the notion which contains the relativity or dependence of its special features in its own independence
- EnL",278
17052,"It is the idea which, as absolutely first (in the method), regards this terminus as merely the disappearance of the show or semblance, which made the beginning appear immediate, and made itself seem a result
- EnL",213
17053,"It is the knowledge that the idea is the one systematic whole
- EnL",67
17056,"The science in this manner concludes by apprehending the notion of itself, as of the pure idea for which the idea is
- EnL",122
17057,"The Idea which is independent or for itself, when viewed on the point of this its unity with itself, is Perception or Intuition, and the percipient Idea is Nature
- EnL",168
17058,"But as intuition the idea is, through an external 'reflection,' invested with the one-sided characteristic of immediacy, or of negation
- EnL",141
17060,"This return to the beginning is also an advance
- EnL",53
17061,"We began with Being, abstract Being: where we now are we also have the Idea as Being: but this Idea which has Being is Nature
- EnL",131
17062,"It can perhaps be said that philosophy, in our time, enjoys no particular favour or affection; it is at least no longer recognized as the foundation which must constitute the indispensable introduction to all further scientific and vocational education
- PoN",258
17063,"It may certainly be accepted as indisputably true however, that the philosophy of nature in particular is suffering from a very considerable lack of favour
- PoN",161
17064,"I shall not concern myself very fully with the extent to which this particular prejudice is justified, although I cannot of course entirely overlook this question
- PoN",168
17066,"For the most part it has been variously transformed into an external formalism, and perverted into a notionless instrument for superftciality of thought and unbridled powers of imagination
- PoN",194
17067,"The details of the extravaganzas into which death-struck forms of the Idea have been perverted do not concern me here
- PoN",123
17068,"Some years ago I expressed myself more fully on this subject in the preface to 'The Phenomenology of Spirit'
- PoN",114
17069,"It need cause no surprise that the more thoughtful view of nature, in which perception has been guided by the Idea, as well as the crass empiricism of the external abstract under:
- PoN",185
17070,"Crude empiricism and travestied thought-forms, capri ciousness of fancy and the flattest methods of proceeding according to superftcial analogy, have been mixed into a complete chaos, and this stew has been served up as the Idea, reason, science, divine perception
- PoN",270
17071,"A complete lack of system and scientific method has been hailed as the very peak of scientific accomplishment
- PoN",115
17072,"It is charlatanry such as this, and OP Schelling's philosophy is a prime example of it, that has brought the philosophy of nature into disrepute
- PoN",150
17073,"To reject the philosophy of nature outright because of such bungling and misrepresentation of the Idea, is quite another matter however
- PoN",141
17075,"Bearing in mind the present prejudices and the widespread misunder-standings of the philosophy of nature, it might seem appropriate to begin by evincing the true Notion of this science
- PoN",190
17076,"The initial opposition we encounter is to be regarded as accidental and superficial however, and all that it entails may be left on one side without more ado
- PoN",163
17077,"Dealing with it would tend to involve polemics, and would not be gratifying
- PoN",81
17078,"What might be learnt is partly subsumed under the science itself, and would not be so instructive as to justify reducing still further the already limited space available for the wealth of material to be dealt with in an encyclopaedia
- PoN",240
17079,"What we are engaged on here is not a matter of imagination and phantasy; it is the matter of the Notion, and of reason
- PoN",124
17080,"This standpoint does not justify our discussing the Notion, determination, manner and method of the philosophy of nature at this juncture
- PoN",143
17081,"It is fitting however that the treatment of a science should be preceded by the determination of its position, purpose, and content, and the way in which the content is to be regarded
- PoN",189
17082,"It is unnecessary to counter a perversion of the philosophy of nature once we have defmed the Notion of the science more precisely
- PoN",136
17083,"The science of philosophy is a sphere, and each member of the sphere has its antecedent and sequel, so that the philosophy of nature appears as only one sphere within the whole of the encyclopaedia
- PoN",203
17084,"Nature's proceeding forth from the eternal Idea, its creation, the proof indeed that there necessarily is a nature, lies in that which precedes it )
- PoN",154
17085,"Here we have to presuppose this as known
- PoN",46
17086,"In order to determine what the philosophy of nature is, it is convenient that we should separate it from TO that which determines it; for all determining requires two terms
- PoN",178
17087,"In the first place we find it standing in a peculiar relationship to natural science in general, that is to say, to physics, natural history, and physiology
- PoN",162
17088,"It is indeed physics, but rational physics, and it is at this point of rationality that we have to grasp it, and in particular to determine its relationship to physics
- PoN",173
17089,"This procedure might appear to rest upon a novel distinction
- PoN",66
17090,"At first the philosophy of nature will tend to be regarded as new science, and there is no doubt that in one sense it is
- PoN",126
17091,"In another sense it is not, for it is as old as all observation of nature
- PoN",79
17092,"It does not differ from this observa tion, and thus has traditions more ancient than those of physics, which in Aristotle for example, is much closer to a philosophy of nature than it is today
- PoN",198
17093,"It is only in recent times that the two have become separated
- PoN",67
17094,"The separation is already apparent in Wolff's philosophy, where the science of cosmology, which is supposed to be a metaphysic of the world or nature, but which confines itself to completely abstract determinations of the understanding, is distinguished from physics
- PoN",272
17095,"This metaphysics was certainly further removed from physics than what we now know as the philosophy of nature
- PoN",115
17096,"The first thing to be noticed about this distinction between physics and the philosophy ofnature and the mutual determination which exists between them, is that they are not so widely separated as they might seem to be at first
- PoN",233
17097,"Physics and natural history are regarded as eminently empirical sciences, as belonging exclusively to observation and experience, and as therefore opposed to the philosophy of nature, the cognition of nature by means of thought
- PoN",233
17099,"Physics and the philosophy of nature are therefore to be distinguished, not as perception and thought, but merely by the nature and manner of their thought
- PoN",161
17100,"Both are a thinking cognition of nature
- PoN",45
17101,"We shall first consider the place of thought in physics; this will lead us on to observe what nature is; and our third concern will be the division of the philosophy of nature
- PoN",181
17102,"A Ways of regarding nature Addition
- PoN",41
17103,"In order to find the Notion of the philosophy of nature, we have first to indicate the Notion of the knowledge of nature in general, and then to develop the distinction between physics and the philosophy of nature
- PoN",219
17104,"G , What is nature?
- PoN",26
17105,"It is through the knowledge and the philosophy of nature that we propose to fmd the answer to this general question
- PoN",121
17107,"It remains a problem
- PoN",26
17108,"This quest for being has a multiple meaning
- PoN",49
17109,"If we know the name, it may be a matter of perception
- PoN",59
17110,"If for example I do not know what a box-compass is, I merely have to get someone to show me the instrument, and then I can say that I know
- PoN",144
17111,"In the question, 'What is this man?
- PoN",41
17112,"The meaning of this question, when we ask it because we want to know what the philosophy of nature is, is the object of this investigation
- PoN",144
17113,"To begin in this way might however be confusing
- PoN",53
17115,"Now if we take these determinations in forms known to us, and say that we wish to relate ourselves thinkingly to nature, we are immediately presented with still further ways in which to relate ourselves to it
- PoN",214
17116,"I shall introduce these here not in the interest of com-pleteness, but so that we may fmd in them the raw material or moments which necessarily belong to the cognition of the Idea, and which we are aware of earlier, particularized as the various ways of regarding nature
- PoN",276
17117,"In this way we shall reach the point at which the characteristic feature of our undertaking becomes apparent
- PoN",114
17118,"We relate ourselves to nature partly in TO  practice and partly in theory
- PoN",79
17121,"Nature, viewed in the light of the relationship thus established, is seen from the finiteteleological standpoint which is based on the correct supposition, that nature does not itself contain the absolute and ultimate end 
- PoN",228
17122,"Nevertheless, if this view is based on particular fini te ends, it transforms them partly into presuppositions, the contingent content of which can, by itself, be insignificant and trivial
- PoN",194
17123,"However, for itself, the teleological relationship demands a deeper manner of comprehension than that appropriate to external and finite relationships
- PoN",156
17124,"It thus opens the way for the Notional point of view, which is universally immanent, and therefore also immanent within nature
- PoN",132
17125,"In general, the practical approach to nature is determined by the self-seeking of appetite; need impels us to tum nature to our advantage, to exploit and harness and in short to annihilate it
- PoN",197
17126,"Two further determinations are immediately apparent here
- PoN",62
17127,"Need and ingenuity have enabled man to discover endlessly varied ways of mastering and making use of nature

17133,"To see purpose as inherent within natural objects
- PoN",55
17134,"Aristotle had already noticed this notion of purpose in nature
- PoN",68
17135,"This is the true teleological view
- PoN",40
17136,"Â§ What is now called physics, was formerly called natural philosophy
- PoN",75
17138,"Here the content is not a simple aggregate, but is distributed through orders and classes, and must be regarded as an organic whole
- PoN",137
17139,"In that the philosophy of nature is a comprehending consideration, its object is the same universal; it is however the universal for itself, which it regards in its own immanent necessity, according to the selfdetermination of the Notion
- PoN",243
17140,"Remark The relationship of philosophy to what is empirical was dis cussed in the general introduction
- PoN",107
17141,"It is not only that philosophy  must accord with the experience nature gives rise to; in its formation and in its development, philosophic science presupposes and is conditioned by empirical physics
- PoN",204
17142,"The procedure involved in the formation and preliminaries of a science is not the same as the science itself however, for in this latter case it is no longer experience, but rather the necessity of the Notion, which must emerge as the foundation
- PoN",251
17145,"These analogies may have a certain value, but they can only impose determinations and schemata on the objects in an external manner
- PoN",137
17146,"In the theoretical approach (a) the initial factor is our withdrawing from natural things, leaving them as they are, and adjusting to them
- PoN",144
17147,"In doing this we start from our sense-knowledge of nature
- PoN",63
17148,"If physics were based only on perceptions however, and perceptions were nothing but the evidence of the senses, the activity of a natural scientist would consist only of seeing, smelling, hearing etc, so that animals would also be physicists
- PoN",247
17150,"The more thought predominates in ordinary perceptiveness, so much the more does the naturalness, individuality, and immediacy of things vanish away
- PoN",153
17151,"As thoughts invade the limitless multiformity of nature, its richness is impoverished, its springtimes die, and there is a fading in the play of its colours
- PoN",162
17152,"That which in nature was noisy with life, falls silent in the quietude of thought; its warm abundance, which shaped itself into a thousand intriguing wonders, withers into arid forms and shapeless generalities, which resemble a dull northern fog
- PoN",251
17153,"By thinking things, we transform them into something universal; things are singularities however, and the lion in general does not exist
- PoN",142
17154,"In the second determination which we have just considered, it is precisely this inversion which takes place; and consequently, what we have started upon may well seem to be impossible from the start
- PoN",204
17155,"The theoretical approach begins by checking appetite, it is disinterested, it leaves things to subsist in their own way, and thus immediately displays two aspects, subject and object, the separation of which is fixed as this side and that
- PoN",244
17156,"Our aim is rather to grasp and comprehend nature however, to make it ours, so that it is not something beyond and alien to us
- PoN",131
17157,"This is where the difficulty comes in
- PoN",43
17158,"How are we as subjects to get over into the object?
- PoN",57
17159,"If we venture the leap over this gap, and, while failing to fmd our footing, think that we have found nature, we shall tum that which is something other than we are into something other than what it is
- PoN",207
17160,"Both theoretical relationships are also the precise opposites of one another: we tum things into universals or make them our own, yet as natural things they should be free for themselves
- PoN",192
17161,"This is the crux   TO   of the issue concerning the nature of cognition, and is the concern of philosophy
- PoN",111
17162,"The philosophy of nature is in such a perilous condition however, that it has to demonstrate its existence, and in order to justify it, we shall have to trace it back to what is familiar
- PoN",192
17163,"In the dissolution of the subject-object opposition a specific shape may be noticed, which has been made known partly by science, and partly by religion, in which it is however a past, and which readily overcomes the whole difficulty
- PoN",239
17164,"The unification of both determinations is what is called the primal state of innocence, in which spirit is identical with nature, and the spiritual eye stands immediately in the centre of nature
- PoN",200
17165,"The standpoint of the division of consciousness is the fall of man from the eternal and divine unity
- PoN",106
17166,"This unity is represented as a primal intuition, a ratiocination, which is at the same time a vision, forming and so rationalizing sensuous shapes
- PoN",152
17167,"This intuitive reason is the divine reason, for we may say that God is that in which spirit and nature are one, and in which intelligence at the same time has both being and shape
- PoN",185
17169,"Such a performance, which offers no further credentials, has been generally regarded as the consummation of scientific ability
- PoN",132
17171,"If it were no more difficult than this for consciousness to know truth, but one only had to sit on a tripod and utter oracles, much of the labour of thought would certainly be spared
- PoN",188
17172,"Nevertheless, in order to state clearly where the failing of such a general conception lies, it must be admitted that there is something lofty in it, which at first sight seems highly promising
- PoN",199
17173,"This unity of intelligence and intuition, of the being-in-self of spirit and its relation to externality, must however be the goal not the beginning; it must be a unity which is OIl brought forth, not one which is immediate
- PoN",229
17174,"The natural unity of thought and intuition found in a child or an animal is no more than feeling, it is not spirituality
- PoN",126
17175,"Man must have eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he must have gone through the labour and activity of thought in order to be what he is, ie the subjugator of the separation of what is his, from nature
- PoN",224
17176,"That immediate unity is therefore merely abstract, it is the being-in-self of truth, not the actuality of it; not only the content, but also the form must be true
- PoN",168
17179,"In its relationship to things, appetite is defective not because its attitude towards them is realistic, but because it is all too idealistic
- PoN",147
17180,"Philosophically valid idealism consists in nothing other than the determi-nation that the truth of things lies in their immediate particularity or sensuousness, that they are in fact mere show or appearance
- PoN",212
17181,"According to a metaphysics prevalent at the moment, we cannot know things because they are uncompromisingly exterior to us
- PoN",128
17182,"It might be worth noticing that even the animals, which go out after things, grab, maul, and consume them, are not so stupid as these metaphysicians
- PoN",154
17183,"The same determination, ie that we think natural objects, occurs in the second aspect of the theoretical approach already indicated
- PoN",137
17184,"Intelligence does not of course familiarize itself with things in their material existence
- PoN",96
17185,"In that it thinks them, it sets their content within itself, and to practical ideality, which for itself is mere negativity, it adds form, universality so to speak, and so gives affirmative determination to the negative of particularity
- PoN",242
17186,"This universality of things is not something subjective and belonging to us; it is, rather, the noumenon as opposed to the transient phenomenon, the truth, objectivity, and actual being of the things themselves
- PoN",216
17187,"It resembles the platonic ideas, which do not have their being somewhere in the beyond, but which exist in individual things as substantial genera
- PoN",152
17188,"Proteus will only be compelled into telling the truth ifhe is roughly handled, and we are not content with sensuous appearance
- PoN",132
17189,"The inscription on the veil of Isis, 'I am what was, is, and shall be, and my veil has been lifted by no mortal', melts before TO    thought
- PoN",146
17190,"Hamann is therefore right when he says, 'Nature is a Hebrew word, written only with consonants; it is left to the understanding to add the points'
- PoN",152
17192,"This uncertainty is even more apparent when distinguishing features are looked for not because it is thought that they are the essential objective determinations of things, but because they are a convenient way for us to distinguish things
- PoN",245
17193,"If there were nothing more to it than this, one could for example select the earlobe as a distinctive feature of humanity, for no animal has it
- PoN",149
17194,"One feels immediately however that such a determination is inadequate to the cognition of the essential nature of man
- PoN",123
17195,"If the universal is determined as law, force or matter however, it will not be asserted that this is an external form, a subjective trimming; objective reality is attributed to laws, forces are said to be immanent, and matter is taken to be the true nature of the fact
- PoN",274
17197,"The distinguishing features are claimed to be the universal, the substantial element of the genus
- PoN",103
17198,"Physics regards these universals as its triumph, and it is unfortunately true to say that too much of its activity is concerned with such universalization
- PoN",160
17199,"The current philosophy is called the philosophy of identity
- PoN",65
17200,"It might be much more appropriate to apply this name to this kind of physics, which simply dispenses with determinateness
- PoN",127
17201,"Contemporary electro-chemistry, in which magnetism electricity and chemism are regarded as one and the same thing, is a good example
- PoN",138
17202,"It is a fault in physics that it should involve so much identity, for identity is the basic category of the understanding
- PoN",127
17203,"The material prepared out of experience by physics, is taken by the philosophy of nature at the point to which physics has brought it, and reconstituted without any further reference to experience as the basis of verification
- PoN",231
17204,"Physics must therefore work together with philosophy so that the universalized understanding which it provides may be translated into the Notion by showing how this universal, as an intrinsically necessary whole, proceeds out of the Notion
- PoN",245
17207,"Every cultured consciousness has its metaphysics, its instinctive way of thinking
- PoN",87
17208,"This is the absolute power within us, and we shall only master it if we make it the object of our knowledge
- PoN",113
17209,"Philosophy in general, as philosophy, has different categories from those of ordinary consciousness
- PoN",105
17210,"All cultural change reduces itself to a difference of categories
- PoN",70
17211,"All revolutions, whether in the sciences or world history, occur merely because spirit has changed its categories in order to understand and examine what belongs to it, in order to possess and grasp itself in a truer, deeper, more intimate and unified manner
- PoN",264
17212,"The inadequacy of the thought determinations used in physics may be traced to two very closely connected points
- PoN",117
17213,"Take a flower for example
- PoN",31
17214,"The understanding can note its particular qualities, and chemistry can break it down and analyse it
- PoN",105
17215,"Its colour, the shape of its leaves, citric acid, volatile oil, carbon, hydrogen etc, can be distinguished; and we then say that the flower is made up of all these parts
- PoN",175
17216,"Spirit cannot be confmed to this procedure of the reflective understanding
- PoN",80
17217,"There are two possible ways out
- PoN",37
17218,"Intuition has therefore been reinstated in the philosophy of nature, and set above reflection, but this gets us nowhere, because one cannot philosophize on the basis of intuition
- PoN",184
17219,"This contemplated unity is the Notion, which contains the determinate differences simply as an immanent and self-moving unity
- PoN",131
17221,"If the genera and forces constitute the inwardness of nature, and as opposed to this universal what is outward and particular is ephemeral, a third stage is required, the inwardness of this inwardness
- PoN",206
17222,"This, according to what has been said, would be the unity of the universal and the particular
- PoN",99
17223,"I ask you never to remind Me and mine Of sayings of this kind
- PoN",67
17224,"When this inwardness is grasped, the onesidedness of the theoretical and practical approaches is transcended, and at the same time justice is done to both determinations
- PoN",175
17225,"The one contains a universality without determinateness, the other a particularity without universality
- PoN",109
17228,"One might ask how the universal comes to determine itself, or how the infmite issues forth into fmitude
- PoN",109
17229,"In concrete terms this is the question of the creation of the world by God, in which God is imagined to be a subject, an actuality for Himself, and divorced from the world
- PoN",177
17230,"If such abstract infmitude and universality were external to singularity however, it would itself be only one side of the matter, and therefore finite and singular
- PoN",169
17231,"The insensibility of the understanding consists in its precise cancellation of the determination which it establishes, and so in its doing the opposite of what it intends
- PoN",176
17232,"The singular is supposed to be separated from the universal, but it is precisely on account of this separateness that it is posited within the universal, so that what is present is merely the unity of the universal and the par-ticular
- PoN",240
17233,"God has two relevations, as nature and as spirit, and both manifestations are temples which He fills, and in which He is present
- PoN",134
17234,"God as an abstraction is not the true God; His truth is the positing of his other, the living process, the world, which is His Son when it is comprehended in its divine form
- PoN",179
17235,"God is subject only in unity with His other in spirit
- PoN",59
17236,"The determination and the purpose of the philosophy of nature is therefore that spirit should fmd its own essence, its counterpart, ie the Notion, within nature
- PoN",166
17238,"Spirit has the certainty which Adam had when he beheld Eve, 'This is flesh of my flesh, this is bone of my bones'
- PoN",119
17239,"Nature is, so to speak, the bride espoused by spirit
- PoN",58
17240,"Is this certainty also truth however?
- PoN",43
17241,"The inwardness of nature is nothing but the universal, and we enter it of our own accord if we have thoughts
- PoN",114
17242,"If subjective truth is the correspondence between sensuous representation and the object, objective truth is the correspondence of the object, of the fact, with itself, so that its reality is in conformity with its Notion
- PoN",227
17243,"The essential ego is the self-equality of the Notion, which pervades everything, TO and which through maintaining its control over particular differences, constitutes the universal returning into itself
- PoN",208
17244,"This Notion is, on this account, the true Idea of the universe, the sole actuality
- PoN",88
17245,"Thus God alone is truth, according to Plato, He is that which is immortally alive, and his body and soul are by nature one
- PoN",128
17246,"The first question to arise is therefore, 'Why has God determined himself in order to create nature?'
- PoN",107
17247,"B The Notion of nature Nature has yielded itself as the Idea in the form of otherness
- PoN",91
17248,"Since the Idea is therefore the negative of itself, or external to itself, nature is not merely external relative to this Idea (and to the subjective existence of the same, spirit), but is embodied as nature is the determination of externality
- PoN",249
17249,"If God is all sufficient and lacks nothing, how does He come to  release Himself into something so clearly unequal to Him?
- PoN",128
17250,"The divine Idea is just this self-release, the expulsion of this other out of itself, and the acceptance of it again, in order to constitute subjectivity and spirit
- PoN",170
17251,"The philosophy of nature itself belongs to this pathway of return, for it is the philosophy of nature which overcomes the division of nature and spirit, and renders to spirit the recognition of its essence in nature
- PoN",221
17253,"God disposes therefore, while remaining equal to Himself; each of these moments is itself the whole Idea, and must be posited as the divine totality
- PoN",154
17254,"Distinctiveness can be grasped in three forms; the universal, the particular, and the singular; firstly it is preserved in the eternal unity of the Idea, ie the \yos, the eternal son of God as it was to philo
- PoN",214
17255,"The other of this extreme is singularity, the form of fmite spirit
- PoN",72
17256,"Singularity, as return into self, is certainly spirit, but as otherness to the exclusion of everything else, it is finite or human spirit, for we are not concerned with finite spirits other than men
- PoN",204
17257,"In so far as the individual man is at the same time received into the unity of the divine essence, he is the object of the Christian religion, which is the most tremendous demand that may be made upon him
- PoN",210
17258,"Nature is the third form with which we are concerned here, and as the Idea in particularity, it stands between both extremes

17261,"In Christ the contradiction is posited and overcome as life, passion and resur-rection
- PoN",92
17262,"Nature is the Son of God, not as the Son however, but as abiding in otherness, in which the divine Idea is alienated from love and held fast for a moment
- PoN",159
17264,"Nature is the Idea, but only implicitly
- PoN",45
17265,"That was why Schelling called it a petrified intelligence, which others have even said is frozen
- PoN",102
17266,"God does not remain petrified and moribund however, the stones cry out and lift themselves up to spirit
- PoN",109
17267,"God is subjectivity, activity, infinite actuosity, within which the other is only momentary, and remains implicit within the unity of the Idea, because it is itself this totality of the Idea
- PoN",196
17268,"Since nature is the Idea in the form of otherness, according to the Notion of the Idea, the Idea is not within it as it is in and for itself, although nature is nevertheless one of the modes in which the Idea manifests itself, and in which it must come forth
- PoN",264
17269,"Secondly, it has to be established and demonstrated that this mode of the Idea is nature
- PoN",94
17270,"In order to do this, a comparison will subsequently have to be made, to see if the defmition corresponds to ordinary thinking about nature
- PoN",144
17271,"In other respects however, philosophy need not concern itself with ordinary thinking, nor undertake the tasks it carries out with respect to nature; although such thinking is conformable however, there must, in general, be an agreement between these two aspects
- PoN",267
17272,"The relation between the metaphysical aspect and this basic determination of nature has now to be indicated, and presents itself as the question of the eternity of the world
- PoN",179
17273,"It might well seem as though we could leave metaphysics alone in this connection, but as they may be dealt with succinctly and efficiently at this point, we should not hesitate to bring them TO forward
- PoN",207
17274,"The metaphysics of nature, the essential thought-determinateness of its distinctiveness, is that it is the Idea in its otherness
- PoN",134
17275,"It is therefore essentially of an ideal nature, and determinate only through its being relative to a first principle
- PoN",122
17277,"Its secondary content is the image of nature as something uncreated, eternal, and inherently independent of God
- PoN",117
17278,"This secon dary content is removed and completely disposed of by the determinateness of nature, its constituting the otherness of the Idea
- PoN",144
17279,"With regard to its primary meaning therefore, after the absoluteness of the world has been removed from the argument, the question is merely concerned with the relation between eternity and the time-image employed
- PoN",219
17280,"The world is created, is now being created, and always has been created; this becomes apparent in the conservation of the world
- PoN",133
17281,"That which is fmite is temporal however, and has a before and after; and if one has the fmite as one's object, one is within time
- PoN",135
17282,"That which is fmite has a beginning, but not an absolute beginning; its time begins with it, and there is no time without fmitude
- PoN",135
17283,"Philosophy is the timeless comprehension of everything in general according to its eternal determination, and including time
- PoN",130
17284,"Matter presents a parallel example, for in that it is infmitely divisible, its nature is such, that what is posited as a whole, as a one, is completely external to itself, while within itselfit constitutes a plurality
- PoN",223
17285,"Matter is not in fact divided in this way however, and does not consist of atoms; its divisibility is a possibility and nothing but a possibility, so that this infmite division is not something positive and actual, but only a subjective OIl idea
- PoN",251
17286,"Infmite time is similar in that it also is merely an idea, a postulated beyond which remains negatived
- PoN",108
17287,"It is a necessary conception so long as one continues to regard what is fmite, but if one passes to the universal, to that which is not finite, then one has left the standpoint at which there is an occurrence of individuality and its variability
- PoN",251
17288,"To ordinary thinking, the world is merely a collection of fmitudes; but if it is grasped as universal, as totality, the question of its beginning becomes meaningless
- PoN",171
17289,"It is then not dear where the beginning is to be made; a beginning has to be made, but only a relative beginning
- PoN",118
17290,"One goes beyond it, but not into infinity, merely to another beginning, which is of course also only a con-ditioned one
- PoN",125
17291,"In short this beginning simply expresses the nature of that which is relative, because we are dealing with finitude
- PoN",121
17292,"Here we have a metaphysics moving indiscriminately between abstract determinations which it takes to be absolute
- PoN",118
17293,"If we ask whether or not the world has a beginning in time, it is impossible that we should receive a plain and straightforward answer to the question
- PoN",156
17294,"It is assumed that a plain answer would assure us of one or the other of these alternatives, but the plain answer is that the either-or assumed by the question is unwarranted
- PoN",180
17295,"Being finite, one's beginning is also not a beginning, and the conflict between these opposed determinations, as it is involved in finitude, is devoid of resolution and reconciliation
- PoN",189
17296,"It is because the finite is this contradiction that it perishes
- PoN",69
17297,"The fmite is preceded by another, and its antecedents have to be sought, in the history of the earth or of mankind for example, when its context is being traced
- PoN",166
17298,"There is no end to such an enquiry, just as there is an end to be found in all that is finite, time having power over the plurality of the finite
- PoN",151
17299,"The finite has a beginning, but this beginning is not the first; it is independent, but this immediacy is limited in the same way
- PoN",135
17300,"In this externality, the determinations of the Notion have the appearance of an indifferent subsistence and isolation with regard to one another; the Notion is therefore internal, and nature in its determinate being displays necessity and contingency, not freedom
- PoN",269
17301,"It is wrong to regard and treat the sun, the moon, animals, plants etc as works of God superior to the deeds and events of humanity
- PoN",137
17302,"Nature is implicitly divine in that it is in the Idea; but in reality its being does not correspond to its Notion, and it is rather the unresolved contradiction
- PoN",166
17303,"Its distinctive characteristic is its positedness, its negativity
- PoN",71
17304,"The ancients grasped matter in general as non-ens, and nature has also been regard ed as the Idea's falling short of itself, for in this external shape the Idea is inadequate to itself
- PoN",190
17305,"It is only to the external and immediate stage of sensuous consciousness that nature appears as that which is primary, immediate, as mere being
- PoN",149
17306,"Even in such an element of externality, nature is, nevertheless, the representation of the Idea, and consequently one may and should admire the wisdom of God within it
- PoN",173
17307,"Vanini said that a piece of straw was enough to prove the being of God, but every product of the spirit, the very worst of its imaginings, the capriciousness of its most arbitrary moods, a mere word, are all better evidence of God's being than any single object
- PoN",267
17308,"It is not only that in nature the play of forms has unbounded and unbridled contingency, but that each shape by itself is devoid of its Notion
- PoN",148
17311,"The superiority of its conforming to its eternal laws through all its contingency is attributed to nature, but that is also the case in the realm of self-consciousness
- PoN",173
17312,"Even faith acknowledges that a providence guides human events
- PoN",67
17313,"Should we regard the determinations of this providence in the field of human events as merely contingent and irrational?
- PoN",126
17314,"If spiritual contingency or caprice goes forth into evil, that which goes astray is still infinitely superior to the regular movement of stars, or the innocent life of the plant, because that which errs is still spirit
- PoN",224
17315,"The infmite divisibility of matter simply means that it is external to itself
- PoN",83
17316,"It is precisely this externality which we first wonder at in the immeasurability of nature
- PoN",96
17317,"Thoughts are not co-ordinated in nature, for Notionlessness holds sway here, and each material point appears to be entirely independent of all the others

- PoN",88
17321,"The heart, liver, eye are not independent individualities on their own account; the hand, severed from the body, decays
- PoN",125
17322,"The organic body is still a whole composed of a multiplicity of mutually external members, but each individual organ subsists only in the subject, and the Notion exists as the power which unites them
- PoN",205
17323,"In this way the Notion, which is something merely inward in Notionlessness, first comes into existence in life, as soul
- PoN",125
17324,"The spatiality of the organism is completely devoid of truth for the soul; if this were not so, we should have as many souls as points, for the soul feels at every point
- PoN",175
17325,"One should not allow oneself to be deceived by the appearance of extrinsicality; one should remember that the mutual externality constitutes only a single illlity
- PoN",168
17326,"Although they appear to be independent, the celestial bodies have to patrol a single field
- PoN",96
17327,"Since unity in nature is a relation between apparently self-subsistent entities however, nature is not free, but merely necessary and contingent
- PoN",150
17328,"Necessity is the inseparability of terms which are differcnt, and yet appear to be indifferent
- PoN",100
17329,"The abstraction of self-externality also receives its due there however, hence the contingcncy or external necessity, contrasting with the inner necessity of the Notion
- PoN",174
17333,"The totality of the disjunction of the Notion exists in nature as a tetrad, the ftrst of which is universality as such
- PoN",124
17334,"The second term is difference, and appears in nature as a duality, for in nature the other must exist for itself as an otherness
- PoN",134
17335,"Consequently, the subjective unity of universality and particularity is the fourth term, which has a further existence as against the other three
- PoN",151
17336,"In themselves the monad and the dyad constitute the entire particularity, and the totality of the Notion itself can therefore proceed to the pentad
- PoN",153
17337,"Jacob Boehme says that God's first birth is Lucifer, this creature of light having centred his imagination upon himself and become evil; this is the moment of difference, of otherness held firm in opposition to the Son, who is otherness held in love
- PoN",255
17338,"Representations such as this, which have a free rein in orientalized taste, have their ground and significance in the negative nature of nature
- PoN",149
17339,"Immediacy is the other form of otherness, and consists of what is different subsisting abstractly by itself
- PoN",113
17340,"This subsisting is only momentary however, it is not true subsistence; only the Idea, because it has returned into itself and is therefore being in and for self, subsists eternally
- PoN",186
17341,"In time nature comes first, but the absolute prius is the Idea
- PoN",68
17342,"This absolute prius is the fmis, the true beginning, alpha is omega
- PoN",73
17343,"Men often consider that which is immediate to be superior to that which is mediated, because the latter seems to imply dependence
- PoN",135
17344,"The Notion has both aspects however, it is mediation through the sublation of mediation, and therefore immediacy
- PoN",118
17345,"An immediate belief in God is often spoken of
- PoN",51
17346,"This is the more degraded, and not the higher mode however, and the original or primitive nature-religions were an expression of it
- PoN",137
17347,"Affirmation in nature is the shining through of the Notion, which soon displays its power through the mutability of this externality
- PoN",138
17348,"All existences are in fact one body, in which the soul has its dwelling
- PoN",77
17349,"Although the Notion displays itself in these gigantic members, it does so imperfectly, and it is only in spirit that it exists as it is
- PoN",141
17350,"Â§ Nature is to be regarded as a system of stages, the one proceeding of necessity out of the other, and being the proximate truth of that from which it results
- PoN",166
17351,"This is not to be thought of as a natural engendering of one out of the other however, but as an engendering within the inner Idea which constitutes the ground of nature
- PoN",175
17352,"Metamorphosis accrues only to the Notion as such, for development is nothing but the alteration of the same
- PoN",113
17353,"In nature the Notion is however partly a mere inner principle, and partly an existence which is simply a living individuality; existent metamorphosis is therefore limited solely to this individuality
- PoN",205
17354,"It is precisely the externality which allows differences to fall apart and appear as indifferent existence, which is characteristic of nature; it is the dialectical Notion which is the inner principle of the same, and guides its stages forward
- PoN",249
17355,"Thinking consideration must reject such nebulous and basically sensuous conceptions as for example the so-called emergence of plants and animals out of waterand of the more highly developed animal organizations out of the lower etc Addition
- PoN",246
17356,"The view that natural things are useful is true in that it denies that they are absolute purpose in and for themselves
- PoN",124
17357,"This negativity is not however external to them, but is the immanent moment of their Idea, which brings about their mutability and transition into another existence, but at the same time their transition into a higher Notion
- PoN",230
17358,"As the Notion posits all particularity within existence at once, it does so in a universal manner
- PoN",103
17360,"It is a way of ordering things, as is the division of nature into the three kingdoms, and is better than mixing everything up, which tends to repel the intuitive Notion in general intelligence
- PoN",198
17361,"But one must not think one makes such a dry series dynamic, philosophical, more comprehensible, or what you will, merely be using the concept of emergence
- PoN",160
17362,"The animal world is the truth of the vegetable world, which in its tum is the truth of the mineralogical world; the earth is the truth of the solar system
- PoN",160
17363,"In a system, the most abstract term is the first, and the truth of each sphere is the last; it is at the same time only the first term of a higher stage however
- PoN",166
17364,"The completion of one stage out of the other constitutes the necessity of the Idea, and the variety of forms has to be grasped as necessary and determinate
- PoN",161
17365,"A land animal has not proceeded by a natural process out of an aquatic animal, and then flown into the air, neither has the bird returned to the earth again
- PoN",162
17366,"If we want to compare the stages of nature with one another we are perfectly justified in observing that this animal has one ventricle, while that has two; but we cannot go on to say that parts have been added, as if this had actually taken place
- PoN",252
17367,"Nor should we use the category of an earlier stage in order to explain a later one; it would be a formal howler to say that the plant constituted the carbon, and the animal the nitrogen pole
- PoN",196
17368,"Evolution and emanation are the two forms in which the progressive stages of nature have been grasped
- PoN",107
17370,"This gradual alteration is said to be an explanation and comprehension of nature
- PoN",86
17371,"The doctrine is derived from the philosophy of nature, and is still widely prevalent
- PoN",90
17372,"Although quantitative difference is easy enough to understand however, it explains nothing
- PoN",96
17373,"The course of emanation is peculiar to the oriental world, where it is regarded as a series of degradations, beginning with the perfection and absolute totality of God
- PoN",173
17374,"God has created, and fulgurations, flashes, and likenesses have proceeded from Him, so that the first likeness most resembles Him
- PoN",135
17375,"The first production is supposed, in its tum, to have given birth to some thing less perfect than itself, and so on down the scale, so that each thing begotten is in its turn procreative down as far as the negative, which is matter, or the acme of evil
- PoN",258
17376,"In this way emanation ends in the complete absence of form
- PoN",64
17378,"That which appears to be subordinate within them, such as organs with no functions, may only be clearly understood by means of the higher organizations in which one recognizes the functions they perform
- PoN",208
17379,"If that which is perfect is to have the advantage over that which is imperfect it must exist in reality, and not only in the imagination
- PoN",142
17380,"In the concept of metamorphosis there is also a fundamental idea which persists throughout all the various genera as well as the individual organs, so that they are merely transfigurations of the form of one and the same prototype
- PoN",236
17381,"One speaks for example of the metamorphosis of an insect, in which the caterpillar, the chrysalis and the butterfly are one and the same individuaL In individuals it is certainly true that the development takes place in time, but this is not so in the genus
- PoN",263
17382,"If the genus exists in a particular way, the other modes of its existence are also posited
- PoN",96
17383,"If water is posited, air and fire are also etc It is important to maintain identity, but not less important to maintain difference, which is pushed into the background if only quantitative change is considered
- PoN",215
17384,"It is here that the simple concept of metamorphosis shows itself to be insufficient
- PoN",89
17385,"This leads on to the concept of a series of natural things, and in parti-cular, of living things
- PoN",102
17386,"The desire to understand the necessity of such a development makes us look for a law governing the series, or a basic determination which, while positing variety, recapitulates itself within it, and so simultaneously engenders a new variety
- PoN",246
17387,"But to augment a term by the successive addition of uniformly determined elements, and only to see the same relationship between all the members of the series, is not the way in which the Notion determines
- PoN",211
17388,"It is in fact precisely this conception of a series of stages and so on, which has hindered advances in the recognition of the necessity of formations
- PoN",156
17390,"The old saying, or law as it is called, 'non datur saltus in natura' is by no means adequate to the diremp- TO tion of the Notion
- PoN",135
17391,"The continuity of the Notion with itself is of an entirely different nature
- PoN",81
17393,"In the sphere of nature, contingency and determinability from without come into their own
- PoN",95
17394,"This contingency is particularly prevalent in the realm of concrete individual formations, which are at the same time only immediately concrete as things of nature
- PoN",169
17396,"The impotence of nature is to be attributed to its only being able to maintain the determinations of the Notion in an abstract manner, and to its exposing the foundation of the particular to determination from without
- PoN",223
17397,"Remark The infinite wealth and variety of forms, and the utterly irrational contingency which mixes with the external order of natural formations, have been praised as the sublime freedom and divinity of natureor at least as the divinity within it
- PoN",253
17398,"It is to be expected that ordinary ways of thinking should mistake contingency, caprice and lack of order, for freedom and rationality
- PoN",140
17400,"Traces of Notional determination will certainly survive in the most particularized product, although they will not exhaust its nature
- PoN",139
17401,"The traces of this transmission and inner connection will often surprise the investigator, but will be  particularly astonishing or even incredible to those accustomed only to seeing the same contingency in the history of nature as they see in that of humanity
- PoN",266
17402,"Here one has to guard against accepting such traces as the determinate totality of formations, for it is this that gives rise to the analogies mentioned above
- PoN",164
17403,"Nature never fails to blur essential limits with intermediate and defective formations, and so to provide instances which qualify every firm distinction
- PoN",158
17404,"Even within a specific genus such as mankind, monsters occur, which have to be included within the genus, although they lack some of the characteristic determinations which would have been regarded as essential to it
- PoN",222
17405,"In order to classify such formations as defective, imperfect, or deformed, an invariable prototype has to be assumed, with the help of which we are able to recognize these so-called monsters' deformities, and borderline cases
- PoN",231
17406,"This prototype cannot be drawn from experience, but has as its presupposition the independence and worth of Notional determination
- PoN",136
17408,"It is as a positing of that which it is implicitly, that the development of the Notion in accordance with its determination is to be grasped
- PoN",146
17409,"This determination might be regarded as its goal or purpose
- PoN",65
17410,"In the development, these determinations of its content come into existence and are manifested, not however as independent self-sufficient being, but as posited moments of an ideal nature, which remain within its unity
- PoN",224
17413,"The Notion wants to break the rind of externality in order to become itself
- PoN",81
17415,"Unity of form, as it is external to this, is of an ideal nature, and as it is simply implicit, is merely sought after
- PoN",123
17416,"This constitutes matter and the ideal nature of the system of matter, ie mechanics
- PoN",88
17417,"This is a relationship of reflection, the being-inself of which constitutes natural individuality, ie physics
- PoN",115
17418,"This division follows from the standpoint of the Notion as it is grasped in its totality, and displays the diremption of the Notion in its determinations
- PoN",159
17419,"As it exhibits its determinations in this diremption and yet only allows them independence as moments, it realizes itself in this, and so posits itself as Idea
- PoN",165
17420,"The Notion not only exhibits its moments and expresses itself in its differences however, but also leads these apparently independent stages back into their ideality and unity
- PoN",181
17421,"By leading them back into itself, it in fact turns them for the first time into the concrete Notion, the Idea, and truth
- PoN",126
17422,"There seem therefore to be two ways of formulating this division and so proceeding scientifically
- PoN",103
17424,"The other is the opposite one
- PoN",35
17425,"It begins with the last self-externality of the merely immediate manner in which the Notion first exists, and ends with its true determinate being, the truth of its whole exposition
- PoN",187
17426,"The first way may be compared to the progression in the conception of emanation, the second to the progression implied in the conception of evolution Addition)
- PoN",165
17427,"Each of these two forms taken by itself is onesided, for they take place simultaneously, and the eternal divine process is a unified flow in two antithetical directions, which simply meet and completely permeate each other
- PoN",228
17428,"The first, even when it is given the highest names and regarded as being concrete, is merely an immediacy
- PoN",111
17429,"Matter involves itself into life, and evolution is therefore also involution
- PoN",82
17430,"As the result of the drive of the Idea towards being for itself, independent moments such as the senses of the animal, come into objective existence as the sun, and the lunar and cometary bodies
- PoN",200
17431,"Despite some changes, these bodies retain their shape but lose their independence even in the physical sphere, where they are the elements
- PoN",144
17432,"Projected outwards, subjective sight is the sun, taste is water, and smell is air
- PoN",87
17433,"As it is necessary to posit determinations of the Notion here, we must begin with the most abstract, not with the most concrete sphere
- PoN",140
17437,"Each atom of gold for example contains all the determinations or properties of gold, so that matter is immanently specified and particularized
- PoN",148
17438,"The second determination is that specification as qualitative determinateness, and being-for-self as the point of individuality, still unite in one and the same term, so that the body is fmitely determined
- PoN",211
17439,"Individuality is still bound to defmite, exclusive and specific properties, and is not yet present in its complete and general form
- PoN",137
17440,"If a body of this kind is brought into the process, it ceases to be what it is if it loses these properties
- PoN",113
17441,"In this way qualitative determinateness is posited affirmatively, but not at the same time negatively
- PoN",107
17442,"Organic being, which is an individuality existing for itself and developing itself into its differences within itself, constitutes totality as found in nature
- PoN",164
17443,"Its determinations are at the same time concrete totalities, not merely specific properties, and remain qualitatively determined with regard to one another

17446,"Each of these stages constitutes a characteristic realm of nature, and all of them appear to be separately self-subsistent
- PoN",128
17447,"Each subsequent stage contains those prior to it however, so that the last is the concrete unity of all that have preceded it, and presupposes them as constituting its inorganic nature

17451,"The eternal life of nature consists firstly in the Idea displaying itself in each sphere to whatever extent fmitude makes possible, just as every drop of water yields an image of the sun
- PoN",192
17452,"Secondly, it consists in the dialectic of the Notion, which breaks through the limitation of this sphere, and since it only fmds partial satisfaction in such an inade'luate element, necessarily passes over into a higher stage

17800,"It is here that the being-for-self of matter becomes apparent, and it is by means of this being-for-self that matter asserts itself as internality (which may also be called force), against its externality, which is here its-being-for other, ie the being-within-it of another
- PoN",280
17801,"The ideality of being-for-self consists in another asserting a prevalence within the mass, and vice versa
- PoN",111
17802,"This determination of ideality, which appeared to come from without, shows itself to be the peculiar essence of matter, which at the same time itself belongs to matter's internality; this is the reason why reflective thought makes use of the concept of force in physics

17803,"The strength of an impact, as an amount of activity, is merely that by which matter retains its being-for-self, or resists; for impact is also  resistance; resistance however simply implies matter

17809,"One of the moments of the body is its weight, by which, in its tendency towards the centre of the Earth, it puts pressure on that which resists it
- PoN",152
17810,"Pressure is therefore a motion which tends to sublate the separation of one mass from another
- PoN",99
17811,"The other moment of the body is the transversal movement posited within it, which diverges from the tendency towards the centre
- PoN",133
17812,"The magnitude of its motion is then determined by these two moments, ie by its mass, and the determinability of its transversal motion as velocity
- PoN",152
17813,"If we posit the magnitude of this motion as internal to matter, we have what is called force
- PoN",98
17814,"We could however dispense with this apparatus of forces, for the propositions of mechanics which deal with them are very largely tautological
- PoN",147
17815,"As the determinateness of force is the only determinateness, it is certainly true that we have the same material activity whether the number of material parts is replaced by velocity, or vice versa, for material activity only occurs as self-motivating

17818,"Pressure and impact are the two causes of external mechanical motion
- PoN",74
17819,"Consequendy, impact and resistance, as well as the motion posited through them, have a substantial foundation in a centre which, while lying outside each particular body, is common to them all
- PoN",198
17820,"This explains why each contingent motion imposed on them from without, passes into rest in this centre
- PoN",108
17822,"In relationships where bodies are separated from their centre of gravity by relatively empty space, this tendency constitutes fall, ie essen tial motion, in which contingent motion conforms to the Notion and its existence, by passing over into rest
- PoN",254
17823,"Remark It is the basic proposition of mechanics, that in external finite motion, a body at rest would continue to rest indefinitely, and a moving body would continue to move indefinitely, if they were not forced from one condition to the other by an external cause
- PoN",270
17824,"This proposition merely expresses motion and rest in accordance with the principle ofidentity it tells us that motion is motion, and that rest is rest and that each determination is external to the other
- PoN",209
17825,"It is this abstract separation of motion as it is for itself, from rest as it is for itself, which gives rise to the empty postulate of a perpetual motion, which always involves certain con ditions
- PoN",203
17826,"The nullity of the principle of identity, on which this postulate is based, has been shown in its proper place
- PoN",116

- PoN",154
17833,"It is one thing to distinguish these motions,it is in fact necessary to do so, and to consider them mathematically as separate lines, or treat them as distinct quantitative factors etc, it is another thing to regard them as physically independent existences
- PoN",263
17834,"In the postulated flight of this leaden ball into infinity, the resistance of air and friction is also turned into an abstraction
- PoN",135
17835,"When a perpetuum mobile, no matter how correctly calculated and demonstrated in theory, necessarily passes over into rest in a certain period of time, an abstraction is made of gravity, and the phenomenon is attributed solely to friction
- PoN",243
17836,"The gradual decrease in the motion of the pendulum, and its final cessation, is also attributed to the retardation of friction, as it is also said of this motion that it would continue indefinitely if friction could be removed
- PoN",232
17837,"This resistance which the body encounters in its contingent motion, belongs of course to the necessary manifestation of its dependence
- PoN",140
17839,"Friction is an impediment, but it is not the essential obstacle to external contingent motion
- PoN",99
17840,"Finite motion must be inseparably bound up with gravity therefore, for in its purely accidental form, it passes over into and becomes subject to the direction of gravity, which is the substantial determination of matter

17841,"It is here that gravity itself now occurs as the principle of motion, but of motion determined as cancelling this separation or distance from the centre

17842,"This is self-generating motion, which posits its own determinateness as a manifestation
- PoN",93
17843,"Direction is the first determinateness, and the law of fall is the other
- PoN",78
17844,"Direction is the bearing upon the unit, which is sought and presupposed in gravity; it is a tendency which is not a random indeterminate spatial vacillation, but a unit which matter posits for itself as a place in space which is not however reached by it
- PoN",260
17845,"One cannot say that this centre is present merely as a nucleus to which matter is drawn, or around which it subsequently agglomerates; the gravity of masses generates such a centre, and material points, by seeking one another, posit it as their common centre of gravity
- PoN",275
17846,"Gravity is the positing  of such a unit
- PoN",45
17847,"Each particular mass is the positing of the same, and by this it seeks a unit in itself, and so gathers the whole of its quantitative relationship to others into a single point
- PoN",182
17848,"This subjective unit, which as mere tendency constitutes the objective unit, is a body's centre of gravity
- PoN",112
17849,"Every body has a centre of gravity, by which it has its centre in another body, and it is only in so far as it possesses this centre that the mass constitutes an actual unit or body
- PoN",187
17850,"The centre of gravity is therefore the primary reality of the unit of gravity, the tendency in which the entire weight of the body is concentrated
- PoN",152
17851,"A mass cannot be at rest unless its centre of gravity is supported, but if it is supported, the rest of the body might just as well not be there, for its gravity is completely withdrawn into one point
- PoN",206
17852,"As a line, this point is the lever, to which each part of this unit belongs, and in which the centre of gravity divides itself as middle into points of extremity, the continuity of which constitutes the line
- PoN",213
17853,"Gravity is equally the whole of this unit; the surface con stitutes the unit, but the unit is taken back into the centre as a whole
- PoN",137
17854,"Whatever exhibits itselfhere as the juxtaposition ofdimensions, is in its immediacy a unit
- PoN",96
17855,"It is in this way that the centre of gravity makes itselfinto the whole individual body
- PoN",93
17856,"Each individual mass is then such a body, which strives towards its centre, ie the absolute centre of gravity
- PoN",115
17857,"In so far as matter determines a centre towards which it strives, and this centre is a point of unity while matter remains a multiplicity, matter is determined as proceeding out if itself and out of its place
- PoN",214
17858,"By proceeding out of itself, it also proceeds out of its self-externality, and as sublation of externality, this is the first true inwardness
- PoN",147
17859,"All mass belongs to such a centre, and each particular mass is dependent and contingent as against this truth
- PoN",115
17860,"It is because of this contingency, that an individual mass can be separated from this central body
- PoN",104
17861,"In so far as the specilic mass which intervenes offers no resistance, the body will not be prevented from moving towards the centre; it will then move on account of there being no impediment, or rather fall on account of there being no support
- PoN",249
17862,"The rest into which external motion is brought by fall is certainly still a tendency, but unlike the first kind of rest, it is not contingent, nor is it a mere condition, or posited externally
- PoN",198
17863,"The rest we have now is posited through the Notion, like fall, the motion which is posited through the Notion and sublates external and contingent motion
- PoN",159
17864,"S Here inertia has disappeared, for we have reached the Notion of matter
- PoN",78
17865,"In that each mass, through its weight, has a tendency towards the centre, and therefore exerts pressure, its motion is only an attempted motion, which makes itself effectual within another mass, and so posits its ideal nature
- PoN",231
17866,"Similarly, by offering resistance and maintaining itself, this second mass posits the ideal nature of the first
- PoN",117
17867,"In finite mechanics both kinds of I rest and motion are placed on the same level
- PoN",86
17868,"Everything is reduced to interrelated forces differing only in direction and velocity; consequently the result becomes all-important
- PoN",138
17869,"Thus, the motion of fall, which is posited by the force of gravity, is placed on the same level as the force of projection
- PoN",128
17870,"It is imagined that if a cannon-ball were to be shot forth with a force greater than that of gravity, it would escape at a tangent, if, it is added, there were no resistance from the air
- PoN",192
17871,"It is also thought that the pendulum would go on swinging indefmitely if the air offered no resistance
- PoN",108
17872,"By falling into the perpendicular, it has acquired a velocity by virtue of which it must reach a height on the other side of the arc equal to that of the point from which it started
- PoN",187
17873,"It must therefore continue to move from side to side'
- PoN",59
17874,"On one side the pendulum follows the direction of gravity, and this direction is then sublated; that is to say that it is removed from the direction of gravity by the communication of a new determination
- PoN",209
17875,"It is this second determination which produces the lateral motion
- PoN",71
17876,"It is then asserted that, 'It is primarily because of resistance, that the arc of oscillation becomes progressively smaller and the pendulum fmally comes to rest, for if there were no resistance, the oscillatory motion itself would continue indefinitely'
- PoN",260
17877,"Gravitational and transversal motion are not however two opposed kinds of movement
- PoN",88
17878,"The first is the substantial movement, within which the second is contingently absorbed
- PoN",93
17879,"Friction itselfis not contingent however, for it is the result of gravity, although it can also be reduced
- PoN",112
17880,"Francoeur realized this ('Traite elementaire de mechanique', p n -) when he said, 'Le frottement ne depend pas de l' etendue des surfaces en contact, Ie poid du corps restant Ie meme
- PoN",188
17881,"Le frottement est proportionel la pression'
- PoN",49
17882,"Friction is therefore gravity in the form of an external resistance; it is pressure as a mutual drawing towards the centre
- PoN",128
17883,"In order to counteract the variable motion of the body, it has to be attached to something else
- PoN",101
17884,"This material connection is necessary, but it disturbs the motion and so gives rise to friction
- PoN",101
17885,"Friction is therefore a necessary factor in the construction of a pendulum, and can be neither eliminated nor thought away
- PoN",128
17886,"If one imagines what it would be like without it, one is dealing with an empty concept
- PoN",92
17887,"It is not only friction which brings the movement of the pendulum to rest however, for even if friction ceased, the pendulum would still come to rest
- PoN",155
17888,"Gravity is the power which brings the pendulum to rest in conformity with the Notion of matter, for as the universal principle of matter, it maintains its preponderance over what is alien, and oscillation ceases in the line of fall
- PoN",237
17889,"This necessity of the Notion appears in  a  this sphere of externality as an external impediment or as friction
- PoN",117
17890,"A man can be struck dead, but this external circumstance is contingent; the truth of the matter is that the man himself dies
- PoN",130
17891,"The combinations of fall with contingent motion, in projection for example, do not concern us here, where we have to consider the sublation of purely contingent motion
- PoN",173
17892,"In projection the magnitude of the motion depends upon the force of the projection and the weight of the mass
- PoN",115
17893,"It is this very weight however, which is at the same time gravity; in that it gains preponderance as the universal, it overcomes the determinateness posited within it
- PoN",172
17894,"The body is projected only by means of gravity; it passes out of its determinate direction however, although only to return into the universal and become simple fall
- PoN",171
17895,"This return gives a further determinability to gravity, in which motion comes still closer to its unity with it
- PoN",117
17896,"In projectile motion weight is only one moment of the motive force, it is the transition by which the force lying outside gravity is posited within it
- PoN",156
17897,"This transition increases the extent to which gravity constitutes all motive force
- PoN",88
17898,"The principle of motion is certainly still external to it, but in a completely formal way as mere impulse, which in fall is simple removal
- PoN",144
17899,"It is in this way that projection constitutes fall, and both of these occur simultaneously in the motion of the pendulum
- PoN",126
17900,"Gravity is removal-from-self, a presentation of itself as self-sundering, but everything is still external
- PoN",112
17901,"The fixed point, the removal from the line of fall, the holding at a distance of the motivated point, and the moments of the actual motion, belong to something else
- PoN",170
17902,"The return from projection into the line of fall is itself projection, and the oscillation of the pendulum is the falling self-producing sublation of projection
- PoN",166
17903,"At the same time, it is however only the primary negation ofexternality, and is therefore conditioned
- PoN",107
17904,"Separation from the connection , Of with the centre is therefore still a contingent determination, posited externally
- PoN",124
17905,"Remark The laws of the motion are concerned with q uan ti ty, and in particular with distances traversed in periods of time, and the highest credit accrues to the analysis of the understanding by reason of the immortal discoveries it has made in this field
- PoN",262
17906,"The further non-empirical proof of these laws has been provided by mathematical mechanics however, for even science which bases itself upon empiricism discovers the inadequacy of the purely empirical mode of demonstration
- PoN",227
17907,"In the a priori proof in question, it is assumed that velocity is uniformly accelerated
- PoN",93
17909,"These determinations are completely lacking in empirical confirmation, and are in no way in conformity with the Notion
- PoN",124
17910,"Consequently, the quantitative determination, which here contains a potency relationship, is formed into a sum of two mutually independent elements, so that the qualitative determination, which is connected with the Notion, is eliminated
- PoN",243
17911,"One of the corollaries drawn from the law supposed to have been proved in this way is, 'That in uniformly accelerated motion, the velocities are proportional to the times'
- PoN",177
17912,"In fact this proposition is nothing more than the com-pletely straightforward definition ofuniformly accelerated motion
- PoN",125
17913,"This is the simple, genuine proof
- PoN",39
17914,"V is the t general velocity, which is as yet indeterminate, and so at the same time abstract, ie simply uniform
- PoN",117
17915,"Consequently, the determination
- PoN",37
17916,"As against the abstract uniform velocity of lifeless and externally determined mechanism, the law of fall is a free law of nature, ie it has a side to it which determines itself from the Notion of the body
- PoN",211
17917,"Since it follows from this that the law must be deducible from this Notion, it has to be shown how Galileo' la w, 'That the spaces traversed are as the squares of the times elapsed', accords with the determination of the Notion
- PoN",233
17918,"The connection here lies simply in this, that since the Notion is here the determinant of motion, time and space, as Notional determinations, become free with regard to one another, ie their quantitative determinations conform to their Notional determinations
- PoN",265
17919,"Now since time is the moment of negation, of being-for-self, and the principle of the unit, its magnitude (any empirical number) in relationship to space is to be considered as the unit or denominator
- PoN",206
17920,"Space on the contrary is juxtaposition, the extent of which is determined only by the extent of time, for in the velocity of this free motion, space and time are not mutually external and contingent, but constitute a single determination
- PoN",243
17922,"This self-extension sets its own self as limit,Â· so that by becoming an other, it merely relates itself to itself
- PoN",120
17923,"The potency relationship is essentially qualitative, and is the only relationship which belongs to the Notion
- PoN",115
17924,"It should be added in connection with what follows, that since fall, in its freedom, still contains conditionality, time remains an immediate number, a merely abstract unit, and the quantitative determination of space only attains to the second dimension
- PoN",260
17925,"The tendency towards the centre is the only absolute factor in fall; we shall see later how the other moment, which is diremption, difference, the removal of the body into a state of supportlessness, also derives from the Notion
- PoN",234
17926,"In fall mass does not separate itself of its own accord, but when it is separated, it returns into the unity
- PoN",114
17927,"The motion which produces itself in fall constitutes the transition therefore, it is a middle term between inert matter, and matter in which its Notion fmds absolute realization, ie absolutely free motion
- PoN",210
17929,"In fall it is in fact merely the weightedness of bodies which comes under consideration, and a large body is as heavy as a smaller one, ie one of less weight

17935,"If a body falls for two seconds, it covers not double, but four times the distance, ie feet; in three seconds X IS feet, and so on
- PoN",136
17937,"This is an interesting procedure, and may well be necessary for mathematical exposition; but this is its only use, and it is a forced representation
- PoN",154
17938,"Proofs of this kind always assume what has to be proved, so they certainly describe what happens
- PoN",102
17939,"Mathematical imagination arises out of the need for a transformation of the potency relationship into a more manageable form, eg by reducing it to addition, or subtraction and multiplication
- PoN",196
17940,"It is because of this that the motion which occurs in fall is analysed into two parts
- PoN",91
17941,"The division has no reality however, and is an empty fiction which merely serves the convenience of mathematical exposition
- PoN",129
17942,"Â§  Fall is merely the abstract positing of a single centre, in the unity of which the difference between particular masses and bodies posits itself as sublated; consequently, mass or weight plays no part in the magnitude of this motion
- PoN",242
17943,"As this negative relation to self, the simple being-for-self of the centre is essentially a repulsion of itself however
- PoN",125
17944,"It is formal repulsion into many immobile centres (stars), and living repulsion in that it determines these centres according to the moments of the Notion and so establishes an essential relation within their Notional differentiation
- PoN",239
17945,"This relation is the contradiction of their independent being-for-self, and their connectedness with the Notion; the appearance of this contradiction between the reality and ideality of these centres is motion, and indeed absolutely free motion
- PoN",250
17946,"The deficiency in the law of fall is the result of our regarding space as posited here in a simply abstract manner in its first power as line; this happens because the motion of fall is conditioned as well as being free (see prec

- PoN",176
18035,"It is however simple facts rather than propositions which have been adduced here
- PoN",86
18036,"The import of this reflection is merely this, that the distinctions and determinations employed by mathematical analysis, and the course to which its methods commit it, should be sharply distinguished from whatever is supposed to have a physical reality
- PoN",259
18037,"It is not the assumptions, procedure and results which analysis requires and affords which are questioned here, but the physical worth and the physical significance of its determinations and procedure
- PoN",206
18038,"It is here that attention should be concentrated, in order to explain why physical mechanics has been flooded by a monstrous metaphysic, which, contrary to both experience and the Notion, has its sole source in these mathematical determinations
- PoN",250
18041,"It follows that the mass of a particular body is to be regarded as a moment in the determina tion of the place which occupies the centre, and that all the bodies ofa system posit their sun
- PoN",194
18043,"This centre is pardy resolved again in the universal system however, and if it persists, as it does in the mutual perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn, it remains at least pardy subordinate to it
- PoN",200
18044,"The connection between the main determinations of free motion and the Notion has only been outlined, and as it is not possible here to develop it any further, it must be left to its fate
- PoN",192
18045,"The principle of the matter is that the rational demonstration of the quantitative determinations of free motion can rest solely upon the Notional determinations of space and time, for these moments, in their intrinsic relationship, constitute motion
- PoN",256
18046,"The Notion in general affects the primary form of returning in to itself through a curve; this is due to the general particularity and individuality of bodies ), which have a semi-independent existence, with their centre pardy in themselves, and pardy in another
- PoN",268
18048,"As has already been observed, these are the lines which should be reserved to mathematical determination, but which have been transformed into physical actualities
- PoN",169
18049,"Further, this motion is uniformly accelerated, and as it returns into itself, it is in turn uniformly retarded
- PoN",116
18050,"In free motion, space and time occur in accordance with what they are by differentiating themselves and entering into the quantitative determination of motion Remark), so that they are not related as they are in abstract simply-uniform velocity
- PoN",250
18051,"It is in the so-called explanation of uniformly accelerated and retarded motion by means of an alternating decrease and increase in the magnitude of the centripetal and centrifugal forces, that the confusion caused by the postulation of such independent forces is greatest
- PoN",278
18053,"It is clear that it is not in   accordance with the nature of forces that the preponderance acquired by one over the other should suddenly switch like this into subordinacy
- PoN",178
18055,"The conclusion drawn from this is simply that it is because the body draws away from the sun after passing perihelion that the centrifugal force increases again, and that as it is furthest from the sun at aphelion, it is just there that this force is greatest
- PoN",265
18056,"In this metaphysical chimera, two opposed and independent forces are assumed, and no further investigation of these fictions of the understanding is thought to be necessary
- PoN",178
18058,"If this inwardly groundless augmentation and diminution is examined more closely, points are found midway between the apsides, in which the forces are in equilibrium
- PoN",171
18059,"The supposed movement of these two forces out of this equilibrium is just as unmotivated as this sudden reversal of their preponderance
- PoN",141
18060,"It is easy enough to see how this method of explanation, in remedying a fault by means of a further determination, gives rise to further and more bewildering confusions
- PoN",174
18061,"A similar confusion arises from the explanation of the fact that the oscillation of the pendulum appears to be slower at the equator
- PoN",138
18062,"This phenomenon is also attributed to a supposedly greater centrifugal force, but it could be ascribed with equal facility to an increase in the force of gravity holding the pendulum more firmly in the perpendicular, or line of rest
- PoN",238
18063,"In so far as it enters into the shape of the orbit, the circle is only to be grasped as the orbit ofa simply uniform motion
- PoN",129
18064,"It is certainly conceivable as it is said, that a uniformly increasing and decreasing motion should take place in a circle
- PoN",128
18065,"This conceiv ability, or possibility, is only an abstract representability however, and as it leaves out the determinate situation to which it applies, it is not only superficial, but wrong
- PoN",195
18066,"The circle is the line returning into itself; all its radii are equal, and it is therefore fully determined through its radius; this is merely a unit, and the unit constitutes the whole determinateness
- PoN",207
18067,"In free motion however, where various spatial and temporal determinations occur in qualitative relationship with one another, the relationship necessarily occurs as a spatial differentiation; which therefore requires two determinations
- PoN",241
18068,"Consequently the form of the path returning into itselfis essentially an ellipse, which is the first of Kepler's laws
- PoN",123
18069,"The abstract determinability which constitutes the circle, also appears in the arc or angle being independent of the two radii by which it is enclosed, and to which it is a purely empirical measure
- PoN",203
18070,"In motion determined by the Notion however, the distance from the centre, and the arc described in a certain time, must be contained in a single determinability, and constitute a single whole, for the moments of the Notion are not related contingently
- PoN",257
18071,"It is this that gives rise to the sector, which is a two-dimensional spatial determination
- PoN",96
18072,"The arc is therefore the essential function of the radius vector, and by its variation in equal periods of time, it carries the inequality of the radii with it
- PoN",165
18073,"That the spatial determination should appear here, by means of time, as the two-dimensional determination of a plane, is connected with what was said above about the exposition of the same determinateness in fall: now in the root as time, and again in the square as space
- PoN",277
18074,"Here however the quadrati city of space is confined to the sector by the return of the line of motion into itself
- PoN",119
18075,"It will be apparent that the second of Kepler's laws, which is concerned with the sweeping out of equal sectors in equal periods of time, rests upon these general principles
- PoN",179
18076,"This law only touches the relation between the arc and the radius vector, and within it time is an abstract unity; as time is the unity which determines the various sectors, they are all equal
- PoN",198
18077,"The further relationship is however that between time and the extent of the orbit, or, for it comes to the same thing, the distance from the centre
- PoN",153
18078,"Here time is not an abstract unity but the general quantum of time taken to complete the orbit
- PoN",100
18079,"We have seen that in fall, which is an imperfectly free motion determined partly in accordance with the Notion, and partly from without, time and space are related to one another as root and square
- PoN",203
18080,"In absolute motion however, which is the realm of free measures, each determinateness attains its totality
- PoN",112
18081,"As root, time is a purely empirical quantity, and in that it is qualitative, it is merely ab stract unity
- PoN",111
18082,"As a mom en t of the developed totality however, it is at the same time a determined unity, a totality for itself, which produces itself, and so relates itself to itself
- PoN",175
18083,"It is however internally dimensionless, and only reaches a formal identity with itself by producing itself as the square
- PoN",126
18084,"Space on the other hand, as positive extrinsicality, attains the dimension of the Notion in the cube
- PoN",106
18085,"It is in this way that their realization simultaneously contains their original difference
- PoN",96
18086,"This is the third of Kepler's laws, which is concerned with the relation between the cubes of the distances, and the squares of the times
- PoN",143
18087,"The great ness of this law consists in its presentation of the rationality of the matter with such simplicity and immediacy
- PoN",129
18088,"In the Newtonian formula however, it is transformed into a law applied to the force of gravity, and so shows how reflection which fails to get to the bottom of things can distort and pervert the truth
- PoN",206
18090,"In magnetism however, the inseparability of the two determinations is already posited, so we do not call it a law
- PoN",119
18091,"In higher shapes, the determinations are linked in the individualization of the third term, so that we no longer have the direct determinations of two interrelated terms
- PoN",175
18092,"It is only in spirit, where there is a mutual confrontation of independent entities, that laws occur again
- PoN",112
18093,"Now the laws of this motion concern the two aspects of the form of its path, and its velocity
- PoN",99
18094,"These have to be developed out of the Notion, but this would demand an extensive investigation, and because of the difficulty of the task, it has not yet been fully accomplished
- PoN",183
18095,"Equal arcs are not described in equal times however, and as it is contrary to the nature of the circle, motion of this kind cannot take place within it
- PoN",157
18096,"The circle is the curve of the understanding, and posits equality
- PoN",71
18097,"Circular motion can only be uniform, for equal arcs can only correspond to equal radii
- PoN",92
18098,"There is no general agreement upon this point, but if it is considered more closely, the opposite is found to be an empty assertion
- PoN",137
18099,"The circle has only one constant, while other curves of the second order have two constants, the major and the minor axis
- PoN",127
18100,"If different arcs are described in the same time, then they must be different not only empirically but in their function, ie it is in their function itself that the difference must lie
- PoN",190
18101,"In the circle, these arcs would in fact only be dis-tinguished from another empirically
- PoN",93
18102,"The radius is essential to the function of an arc in that it is the relation of that which is peripheral to the centre
- PoN",124
18103,"If the arcs are different, the radii must also differ, and the Notion of the circle be immediately transcended
- PoN",116
18104,"Consequently, the assumption of acceleration necessarily implies a variation in the radii, for arc and radius are inseparably connected
- PoN",141
18105,"The path must therefore be elliptical, for its complete motion is a revolution
- PoN",84
18107,"Similarly, the radius is a function of the arc, and of the other radius
- PoN",77
18108,"It should not be forgotten that the determinateness of the whole as an empirical quantity, and a distinct determinability which may be brought into external comparisons, lies in this triangle, and not in the arc as such
- PoN",225
18110,"A line can only be subsumed under a necessary determinateness if it is a moment of a whole
- PoN",96
18111,"The extent of the line is a merely empirical element, the whole first appears in the triangle
- PoN",99
18112,"This is the origin of the mathematical conception of the parallelogram of forces in fmite mechanics, in which the space traversed is presented as the diagonal, which is therefore posited as part of a whole or function, and so susceptible to mathematical treatment
- PoN",269
18113,"Centripetal force is the radius, centrifugal force the tangent, and the arc is the diagonal of the tangent and the radius
- PoN",127
18114,"These are only mathematical lines however; separate the whole from physical reality, and it becomes an empty representation
- PoN",129
18115,"In the abstract motion of fall, the squares, that is to say the plane involved in the time factor, are only numerical determinations
- PoN",138
18116,"The square is not to be taken in a spatial sense, because in fall only a straight line is traversed
- PoN",105
18117,"It is this which constitutes the formal element in fall, and when the space traversed in fall is also represented as a plane expressing a quadratic spatial relationship, this is therefore a merely formal construction
- PoN",222
18118,"However, as the time which sublates itself here corresponds to a plane, it is here that the self-production of time attains reality
- PoN",137
18119,"The sector is a plane produced by the arc and the radius vector
- PoN",69
18120,"The two determinations of the sector are the space transversed, and the distance from the centre
- PoN",102
18121,"The radii drawn from the focus in which the central body is situated are not all the same
- PoN",95
18122,"If two sectors are equal, the one with the longer radii will have the smaller arc
- PoN",87
18123,"Both sectors should be traversed in the same time, consequently, in the sector with the longer radii, both the distance travelled and the velocity will be less
- PoN",165
18124,"The arc or the distance travelled is here no longer an immediate term, but by its relation to the radius, which is not yet present in fall, it is reduced to a moment, and therefore to the factor of a product
- PoN",213
18125,"Yet the spatiality determined through time here forms two determinations of the path itself, ie the space traversed, and the distance from the centre
- PoN",155
18126,"The time taken determines the whole, of which the arc is only a moment
- PoN",76
18127,"It is because of this that equal sectors correspond to equal times; the sector is determined by time, so that the space traversed is reduced to a moment
- PoN",158
18128,"The situation here corresponds to that in leverage, in which the load and the distance from the fulcrum are the two moments of equilibrium
- PoN",144
18129,"He had been on the brink of discovering it earlier, but an error in calculation had prevented him from doing so
- PoN",117
18130,"It was his unshakeable belief in the inherent rationality of the facts that led him to his discovery
- PoN",106
18131,"Previous consideration has made it seem likely that time has a dimension less than space
- PoN",94
18132,"Since space and time are bound together here, each is posited in its singularity, and their quantitative determinability is determined by their quality
- PoN",157
18133,"These laws are some of the frnest, purest, and least contaminated with heterogeneous matter that we have in the natural sciences
- PoN",134
18134,"It is therefore of the greatest interest to reach an understanding of them
- PoN",80
18135,"These Keplerian laws are presented in their purest and clearest form
- PoN",74
18136,"According to the Newtonian form of the law, gravity governs motion, and its force works in inverse proportion to the square of the distances
- PoN",146
18137,"The honour of having discovered the law of universal gravitation has been attributed to Newton, who, by catching the popular imagination, has won the greatest applause, and obscured the glory of Kepler
- PoN",207
18138,"The Germans have often looked on impassively while the English have assumed authority in this way
- PoN",103
18139,"Voltaire furthered the acceptance of the Newtonian theory among the French, and then the Germans also followed along
- PoN",122
18140,"The merit of Newton's form is of course that it has many advantages in mathematical treatment
- PoN",99
18141,"It is often envy which motivates the debunking of great men, but on the other hand, it is a kind of superstition to regard their accomplishments as unsurpassable
- PoN",167
18142,"The mathematicians themselves have been unjust to Newton in so far as they have regarded gravity in two different ways
- PoN",124
18143,"In the first instance it is simply the direction in which a stone falls at IS feet a second on the surface of the earth, and as such it is a purely empirical determination
- PoN",177
18144,"The law of fall is ascribed principally to gravity, but as the moon also has the earth as its centre, Newton applied it to lunar motion, so that the quantity of feet is also taken as basic to the orbit of the moon
- PoN",219
18145,"The distance of the moon from the earth is sixty times the earth's diameter, and this fact is therefore used to determine the moment of attraction in lunar motion
- PoN",168
18146,"It is then found that the earth's power of attraction over the moon (the sinus versus, the sagitta) also determines the entire lunar orbit, and that the moon falls
- PoN",169
18147,"This may very well work out in this way, but it remains a particular case, in which the empirical extent of fall on the surface of the earth is merely extended to the moon
- PoN",177
18148,"It is not meant to apply to the planets, or would only be valid in the relationship between them and their satellites
- PoN",123
18149,"It is therefore a limited principle
- PoN",41
18150,"Fall is said to apply to the heavenly bodies
- PoN",50
18151,"These bodies do not fall into the sun how-ever, and in order to counteract fall, yet another motion is attributed to them
- PoN",127
18152,"This is accomplished easily enough
- PoN",40
18153,"Boys do the same thing when they whip the side of a top to keep it from toppling over
- PoN",91
18154,"Such a puerile attitude towards the free motion of the planets is not to be tolerated however
- PoN",99
18155,"Universal gravitation is therefore only the second meaning of gravity, and Newton saw in gravity the law of all motion; he therefore transferred gravity to the law governing the celestial bodies, and called it the law of gravity
- PoN",234
18156,"It is this generalization of the law of gravity which constitutes the merit of Newton's work
- PoN",98
18157,"If we examine the law of planetary revolution however, we shall discover only one law of gravity, for although the centripetal force is supposed to constitute only one of the moments, the centrifugal force is a superfluous element, and therefore disappears completely
- PoN",273
18158,"Consequently, the construction of motion out of these forces shows itself to be futile
- PoN",92
18159,"The law of one of these moments, ie that which is attributed to attractive force, is not the law of this force alone, but shows itself to be the law of the entire motion, the other moment becoming an empirical coefficient
- PoN",227
18160,"Nothing more is heard of centrifugal force
- PoN",48
18161,"Elsewhere these two forces are readily allowed to separate
- PoN",64
18162,"Centrifugal force is said to be an impulse received by bodies in accordance with their direction and magnitude
- PoN",116
18163,"Such an empirical quantity can no more constitute the moment of a law than can the feet
- PoN",93
18164,"If one wants to determine the laws of centri fugal force as they are in themselves, contradictions will present themselves, as is always the case with opposites of this kind
- PoN",179
18165,"Sometimes they are credited with the same laws as centripetal force, and sometimes with others
- PoN",100
18166,"The greatest confusion arises however if one attempts to separate the action of these two forces when they are no longer in equilibrium, but one is greater than the other, and one is supposed to be increasing while the other diminishes
- PoN",241
18167,"The centrifugal force is said to be at its maximum in aphelion, and the centripetal force in perihelion
- PoN",109
18168,"One could just as well assert the opposite however
- PoN",56
18169,"If the attractive force of the planet is greatest when it is closest to the sun, it is precisely at this point that the centrifugal force ought also to be at its maximum, in order to prevail as the distance from the sun begins to increase again
- PoN",250
18170,"If one assumes a gradual increase in the force in question instead of a sudden switchover, one has to assume an even greater increase in the other force, so that the opposition admitted for the purpose of explanation, breaks down
- PoN",235
18171,"In some expositions the increase in one is taken to be different from the increase in the other, but the result is the same
- PoN",129
18172,"This switching around, in which each is always supposed to be prevailing over the other, merely leads to confusion

- PoN",68
18176,"The opposite might be asserted with equal plausibility and rather more truth
- PoN",82
18177,"Slower oscillation means that the direction of the vertical, or the line of the rest, is stronger; here therefore motion in general is weakened; the motion is deviation from the direction of gravity; consequently, the truth of the matter is that gravity is augmented
- PoN",272
18178,"This is the outcome of such oppositions
- PoN",45
18179,"It was not Newton but Kepler who ftrst thought of the planets as standing in immanent relation to the sun, and it is therefore absurd to regard their being drawn as a new idea originating with Newton

- PoN",68
18186,"An explanation of the matter was called for, and Newton was content with a bad one
- PoN",88
18187,"The idea of the infmitely small stands out in this proof, which depends upon Newton's having posited all triangles in the infmitely small as equal
- PoN",152
18188,"The sine and the cosine are unequal however, and if one then says that they are equal when posited as infmitely small quanta, the proposition will certainly enable one to do anything

- PoN",138
18190,"It is upon such propositions that the Newtonian proof is based, and that is why it is such an utterly bad one
- PoN",115
18191,"Analysis goes on to deduce the other two laws from the ellipse; it has found a non-Newtonian way of doing this, but it is    precisely the first law, the foundation of the deduction, which remains unproved

- PoN",120
18193,"The mathematical determination : was stressed by Newton when he arranged Kepler's laws in order to express gravity, but it was already present in these laws

- PoN",138
18206,"In this primary relationship, gravity has not yet unfolded into the totality of the Notion; for it to do so, it is necessary that the particularization into many bodies by which the subjectivity of the centre objectifies itself, should be further determined within itself

18230,"They therefore rotate about a centre belonging to another individual body, by which they are repelled
- PoN",107
18231,"They are completely indifferent to particularity of place, and they express this contingency of determinate place by rotation
- PoN",131
18232,"As they remain in the same spatial determination with regard to the central body, they move about it in an inert rigid manner; the relationship of the moon to the earth is an example of this
- PoN",196
18233,"A certain place A in the mobile peripheral body will always remain in the straight line joining the absolute and relative centres, and every other point B constantly maintain its determinate angle
- PoN",202
18234,"It is as a mere mass that the dependent body moves about the central body therefore, not as a self-related individual body
- PoN",128
18235,"It is the dependent heavenly bodies which constitute the aspect of particularity; this is why they fall apart and differentiate themselves, for in nature particularity exists as duality, and not as unity, as it does in spirit
- PoN",231
18237,"The second of these is the cometary sphere, and expresses this whirling which makes a permanent effort to disperse and scatter itself into the infinite or void
- PoN",165
18238,"In this context, the shape of a body, and the whole conception of the comets and celestial bodies which deals merely with their contingency, and is based upon knowledge accumulated simply by look- ing at them, has to be put out of mind
- PoN",241
18240,"All the imaginative theories of what is called' explain-ing the origin', according to which the comets may be ejected from the sun, atmospheric vapours and so on, belong without exception to this way of thinking
- PoN",217
18241,"Explanation of this kind may well attempt to state what the comets are, but it merely bypasses the essential point, which is their necessity; and it is precisely the necessity which constitutes the Notion
- PoN",210
18242,"There is therefore no particular excuse for our taking up these phenomena and tinselling them with a glitter of thought
- PoN",125
18243,"The cometary sphere threatens to break away from the universal self-relating order, and lose its unity
- PoN",108
18244,"It is formal freedom, which has its substance outside itself, a pushing out into the future
- PoN",97
18245,"In so far as it constitutes a necessary moment of the whole however, it does not escape from this whole, and so remains included within the first sphere
- PoN",158
18246,"Nevertheless it is uncertain whether such a sphere dissolves itself as an individual and other individuals come into existence, or whether it is perpetually moving as a motion about the first sphere, which is external to it, and in which it has its repose
- PoN",261
18247,"Both possi-bilities belong to the contingency of nature, and this division or transition by stages from the determinateness of this sphere into another, is to be reckoned with as proper to material existence
- PoN",213
18248,"Nevertheless, the extreme limit of the aberration itself consists necessarily in an indefmite approach to the subjectivity of the central body, until the point is reached at which repulsion takes place
- PoN",207
18249,"The opposition is the duality of the immediate otherness and the cancellation of this otherness
- PoN",101
18250,"It is not a pure flux or the opposition as such however, but this opposition as it seeks its rest or centre
- PoN",113
18251,"It is subIa ted future, the past as moment, in which the opposi-tion is sublated in its Notion, although not yet in its determinate being
- PoN",143
18253,"A satellite does not yet have its being-in-and-for-self within itself nor does it revolve about its axis; its axis is outside it, but it is not the axis of the solar sphere
- PoN",178
18254,"Considered purely as a motion, the lunar sphere is rigidly controlled by a single centre, to which it is simply subservient, and the sphere of    aberration is just as dependent
- PoN",183
18255,"The first is abstract obedience, and conformity to another, the second is merely intended freedom
- PoN",103
18256,"The cometary sphere constitutes an eccentricity controlled by an abstract whole, while the lunar sphere is quiescent inertia
- PoN",130
18257,"Consequently, although the planet also has its centre in itself, it is a merely relative centre, and as it does not contain its absolute centre, it is not independent
- PoN",172
18258,"The planet has both determinations within it, and displays them by its change of place
- PoN",92
18259,"It shows its independence only by its parts' changing place in relation to the position which they hold with regard to the straight line joining the absolute and relative centres; it is this which is the basis of the rotatory motion of the planets
- PoN",253
18260,"The precession of the equinoxes is caused by the movement of the orbital axis
- PoN",83
18261,"The axis of the earth also has a nutation, and its poles describe an ellipse
- PoN",82
18262,"As it constitutes the third sphere, the planet concludes and completes the whole
- PoN",86
18263,"This quadruplicity of celestial bodies forms the completed system of rational corporeality
- PoN",96
18264,"It is necessary to a solar system, and is the developed disjunction of the Notion
- PoN",87
18265,"These four spheres between them show forth the moments of the Notion within the heavens
- PoN",93
18266,"It may seem strange to attempt to fit the comets in here, but that which is present must necessarily be contained in the Notion
- PoN",133
18267,"Differences are still thrown freely apart here
- PoN",52
18268,"We shall pursue the solar, planetary, lunar, and cometary spheres through all the subsequent stages of nature
- PoN",115
18269,"The deepening of nature is merely the progressive transformation of these four
- PoN",84
18270,"It is because planetary nature is the totality, the unity of opposites, while the other spheres, being its inorganic nature, merely exhibit its particular moments, that it is the most perfect to come under consideration here; and this is also true of it as a motion
- PoN",271
18271,"It is for this reason that living being occurs only on the planets
- PoN",72
18272,"Ancient peoples have glorified the sun and worshipped it; we do the same when we recognize the final supremacy of the abstract understanding, and so determine God for example, as the supreme essence
- PoN",204
18273,"This totality is the ground and universal substance on which that which follows is borne
- PoN",94
18274,"This totality of motion is everything, but everything withdrawn into a higher being-in-self, or, to express it differently, realized as a higher being-in-self
- PoN",164
18276,"Terrestrial being, and more particularly organic being and self-consciousness, has escaped from the motion of absolute matter but remained in sympathy with it, and lived on with it as within its own inner element
- PoN",218
18277,"The changes of the seasons and times of day, and the changeover from waking to sleep, constitute the terrestrial life in organic being
- PoN",140
18278,"In itself each of these moments constitutes a sphere of proceeding out of self, and of returning into its central point or power, so that it embraces or subdues all the multifarious elements of consciousness
- PoN",213
18279,"Night is the negative to which everything returns, and organic being therefore derives its strength and consequently its negative being from thence, so that it may return again refreshed to the waking multifariousness of existence
- PoN",236
18280,"Each has the universal sphere within it therefore, and is a sphere periodically returning into itself, and expressing the universal through its determinate individuality
- PoN",175
18281,"The magnetic needle does so by its periodic deviations; according to Fourcroy's observations, man does so partly by his four-day periods of increasing and decreasing, in which he puts on for three days, and on the fourth returns to his original dimensions
- PoN",261
18282,"The periodic courses of diseases might also be cited here
- PoN",63
18283,"It is however in the circulation of the blood, the rhythm of which differs from that of the respiratory sphere, and thirdly in peristaltic movement, that the fully developed totality of the sphere occurs
- PoN",209
18284,"The generally higher nature of physical being prevents this sphere from expressing its peculiar freedom however, and in order to study universal motion, one must concentrate upon its freedom, not upon these trivial appearances
- PoN",232
18285,"In individuality it is not its free existence, but a mere internality or intention which is present
- PoN",105
18286,"The exposition of the solar system has not yet been completed by what has been said, and although the basic determinations have been adduced, there are still supplementary determinations which could be added
- PoN",213
18287,"The relationship between the orbits of the planets, their reciprocal inclinations, and the inclinations of comets and satellites to them, are all fields of enquiry which could still be of interest to us
- PoN",208
18288,"The orbits of the planets do not lie in a single plane, and what is more, the courses of the comets cut across the planetary orbits at very different angles
- PoN",162
18289,"These do not deviate from the ecliptic, but they change the angle of their reciprocal relations; the motion of nodes is secular
- PoN",133
18290,"It is more difficult to develop these occurrences, and we are not yet able to do so
- PoN",89
18291,"We have only concerned ourselves with the planet in general, but the distances between the planets should also be considered, for although it is as yet undiscovered, there may well be a law governing the series in the distances between the planets
- PoN",253
18292,"Astronomers tend on the whole to scorn the idea of there being such a law, and will have nothing to do with it, but it is necessary that   this should remain an open question
- PoN",180
18293,"Kepler considered the numbers in Plato's 'Timaeus' for example
- PoN",68
18294,"Taking these as a basis, something like the following conjecture might now be made:-Mercury is the first of the planets and if its distance is a, then the orbit of Venus is a b, the orbit of the Earth a b, and that of Mars a b
- PoN",232
18295,"In this way it will certainly become apparent that these first four planets form a whole
- PoN",94
18296,"One might say that the first four bodies of the solar system, constitute a single system in themselves, and that another order subsequently commences, both in the numbers, and in the physical constitution of the planets
- PoN",225
18297,"These four move ina uniform manner, and it is worth noting that there are four with such a homogeneous nature
- PoN",115
18298,"Between Mars and Jupiter there is a sudden wide gap, and a b was not permissible until more recent times, when the discovery of the four smaller planets Vesta, Juno, Ceres, and Pallas, filled it and formed a new group
- PoN",223
18299,"The unity of the planet is here sundered into a crowd of asteroids, all of which have approximately the same orbit
- PoN",120
18300,"Dispersion and separation predominate in this fifth position
- PoN",66
18301,"Then comes the third group
- PoN",32
18302,"Jupiter with its many satellites is a a sb etc This only works out approximately, and the rationality of it is not yet recognizable
- PoN",137
18303,"Then comes Saturn with its rings and seven satellites, and Uranus, which was discovered by Herschel, with a host of satellites which few have seen as yet
- PoN",159
18304,"Here we have a point of departure for the preciser determination of planetary relation ships
- PoN",98
18305,"It is not difficult to see that the law will be discovered in this way
- PoN",76
18306,"Philosophy has to proceed on the basis of the Notion, and even if it demonstrates very little, one has to be satisfied
- PoN",124
18307,"It is an error on the part of the philosophy of nature to attempt to face up to all phenomena; this is done in the fmite sciences, where everything has to be reduced to general conceptions (hypotheses)
- PoN",207
18308,"In these sciences the empirical element is the sole confirmation of the hypothesis, so that everything has to be explained
- PoN",128
18309,"Here I have merely traced the foundations of a rational interpretation, as this must be employed in the comprehension of the mathematical and mechanical laws of nature within the free realm of measures
- PoN",207
18310,"Specialists do not reflect upon the matter, but a time will come when the rational concept of this science will be demanded!
- PoN",130
18311,"The form appears first in its differences in the ideal determinations of space, time, and motion, and in accordance with its being-for-self, as a determinate centre outside self-external matter
- PoN",199
18312,"In developed totality however, this extrinsicality is posited as determined solely by the totality; this is the juxtaposition of matter, outside of which it has no existence
- PoN",179
18313,"It is in this way that form is materialized
- PoN",49
18314,"Looked at in the opposite way, matter has itself attained implicit determinateness of form in this negation of its self-externality in the totality, which was formerly merely the centre which it sought
- PoN",207
18315,"Its abstract and subdued being-in-self, general weightedness, has been resolved into form; it is qualified matter, or physics
- PoN",131
18316,"In this way we conclude the ftrst part; mechanics now con-stitutes a distinct whole
- PoN",89
18317,"In motion, bodies are mere points, and gravity only determines the spatial relations between points
- PoN",105
18318,"The unity of matter is simply the unity of place which matter seeks, it is not a single concrete unit
- PoN",107
18319,"It is in the nature of this sphere that this externality of determinedness should constitute the peculiar determinateness of matter
- PoN",137
18320,"Matter is weighted being-for-self seeking its being-in-self; in this infmity the point is merely a place, so that the being-for-self is not yet real
- PoN",154
18321,"It is only in the whole solar system that the totality of being-for-self is posited, so that what the solar system is as a whole, matter should be in particular
- PoN",166
18322,"The complete form of the solar system is the Notion of matter in general; its self-externality should now be present in each determinate existence of the completely developed Notion
- PoN",187
18324,"It is precisely the total development of being-for-self which is real being-for-self; this might be expressed as the freeing of the form of matter
- PoN",152
18325,"The determinations of form which constitute the solar system are the determinations of matter itself, and these determinations constitute the being of matter, so that determination and being are essentially identical
- PoN",222
18326,"This is of the nature of quality, for if the determination is removed here, being also disappears
- PoN",103
18327,"This is the transition from mechanics to physics
- PoN",54
