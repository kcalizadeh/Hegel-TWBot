This is a bot for generating tweets taken at random from sentences in Hegel's corpus. Currently the books that have been digested by the bot are the three-volume set containing his lectures on the history of philosophy, the Encyclopedia Logic, and his Philosophy of Nature. Next to be done are the Science of Logic and the Phenomenology of Spirit.

There is a csv that holds all the quotes. Two notebooks are used - one cleans Project Gutenberg's .txt versions of Hegel's works, and the other sends the tweets themselves. The tweeter notebook has an option to preview tweets. If you find one that is formatted poorly despite the cleaning, you can remove it from the master sheet. If you like it, run another cell to the send. A separate .py file is included that simply sends the tweets directly.

There also a sheet which contains the quote list from the original Hegel Bot.
