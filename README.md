This is a bot for generating tweets taken at random from sentences in Hegel's corpus. Currently the books that have been digested by the bot are the three-volume set containing his lectures on the history of philosophy.

There is a csv that holds all the quotes. Two notebooks are used - one cleans Project Gutenberg's .txt versions of Hegel's works, and the other sends the tweets themselves. 

There also a sheet which contains the quote list from the original Hegel Bot.

Next Steps - 
1. incorporate more of Gutenberg's texts, as the functionality is there
2. work to digest pdfs, since certain key texts (the Science of Logic and the Phenomenology, for example) are only available as pdf, and pdf has the most recent translations.
